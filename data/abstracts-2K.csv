0912.3211v1	We extend multi-way, multivariate ANOVA-type analysis to cases where one covariate is the view, with features of each view coming from different, high-dimensional domains. The different views are assumed to be connected by having paired samples; this is a common setup in recent bioinformatics experiments, of which we analyze metabolite profiles in different conditions (disease vs. control and treatment vs. untreated) in different tissues (views). We introduce a multi-way latent variable model for this new task, by extending the generative model of Bayesian canonical correlation analysis (CCA) both to take multi-way covariate information into account as population priors, and by reducing the dimensionality by an integrated factor analysis that assumes the metabolites to come in correlated groups.

1101.3462v1	We consider the problem of subspace estimation in a Bayesian setting. Since we are operating in the Grassmann manifold, the usual approach which consists of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the true subspace $U$ and its estimate $\hat{U}$ may not be adequate as the MSE is not the natural metric in the Grassmann manifold. As an alternative, we propose to carry out subspace estimation by minimizing the mean square distance (MSD) between $U$ and its estimate, where the considered distance is a natural metric in the Grassmann manifold, viz. the distance between the projection matrices. We show that the resulting estimator is no longer the posterior mean of $U$ but entails computing the principal eigenvectors of the posterior mean of $U U^{T}$. Derivation of the MMSD estimator is carried out in a few illustrative examples including a linear Gaussian model for the data and a Bingham or von Mises Fisher prior distribution for $U$. In all scenarios, posterior distributions are derived and the MMSD estimator is obtained either analytically or implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method. The method is shown to provide accurate estimates even when the number of samples is lower than the dimension of $U$. An application to hyperspectral imagery is finally investigated.

1105.1758v1	We present a novel factor analysis method that can be applied to the discovery of common factors shared among trajectories in multivariate time series data. These factors satisfy a precedence-ordering property: certain factors are recruited only after some other factors are activated. Precedence-ordering arise in applications where variables are activated in a specific order, which is unknown. The proposed method is based on a linear model that accounts for each factor's inherent delays and relative order. We present an algorithm to fit the model in an unsupervised manner using techniques from convex and non-convex optimization that enforce sparsity of the factor scores and consistent precedence-order of the factor loadings. We illustrate the Order-Preserving Factor Analysis (OPFA) method for the problem of extracting precedence-ordered factors from a longitudinal (time course) study of gene expression data.

1202.3758v1	Low-dimensional embedding, manifold learning, clustering, classification, and anomaly detection are among the most important problems in machine learning. The existing methods usually consider the case when each instance has a fixed, finite-dimensional feature representation. Here we consider a different setting. We assume that each instance corresponds to a continuous probability distribution. These distributions are unknown, but we are given some i.i.d. samples from each distribution. Our goal is to estimate the distances between these distributions and use these distances to perform low-dimensional embedding, clustering/classification, or anomaly detection for the distributions. We present estimation algorithms, describe how to apply them for machine learning tasks on distributions, and show empirical results on synthetic data, real word images, and astronomical data sets.

1705.04886v2	Sparse mapping has been a key methodology in many high-dimensional scientific problems. When multiple tasks share the set of relevant features, learning them jointly in a group drastically improves the quality of relevant feature selection. However, in practice this technique is used limitedly since such grouping information is usually hidden. In this paper, our goal is to recover the group structure on the sparsity patterns and leverage that information in the sparse learning. Toward this, we formulate a joint optimization problem in the task parameter and the group membership, by constructing an appropriate regularizer to encourage sparse learning as well as correct recovery of task groups. We further demonstrate that our proposed method recovers groups and the sparsity patterns in the task parameters accurately by extensive experiments.

1710.02264v1	Reducing user attrition, i.e. churn, is a broad challenge faced by several industries. In mobile social games, decreasing churn is decisive to increase player retention and rise revenues. Churn prediction models allow to understand player loyalty and to anticipate when they will stop playing a game. Thanks to these predictions, several initiatives can be taken to retain those players who are more likely to churn. Survival analysis focuses on predicting the time of occurrence of a certain event, churn in our case. Classical methods, like regressions, could be applied only when all players have left the game. The challenge arises for datasets with incomplete churning information for all players, as most of them still connect to the game. This is called a censored data problem and is in the nature of churn. Censoring is commonly dealt with survival analysis techniques, but due to the inflexibility of the survival statistical algorithms, the accuracy achieved is often poor. In contrast, novel ensemble learning techniques, increasingly popular in a variety of scientific fields, provide high-class prediction results. In this work, we develop, for the first time in the social games domain, a survival ensemble model which provides a comprehensive analysis together with an accurate prediction of churn. For each player, we predict the probability of churning as function of time, which permits to distinguish various levels of loyalty profiles. Additionally, we assess the risk factors that explain the predicted player survival times. Our results show that churn prediction by survival ensembles significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of traditional analyses, like Cox regression.

1712.03605v1	We derive a novel sensitivity analysis of input variables for predictive epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. We use Bayesian neural networks with latent variables as a model class and illustrate the usefulness of our sensitivity analysis on real-world datasets. Our method increases the interpretability of complex black-box probabilistic models.	Sensitivity Analysis for Predictive Uncertainty in Bayesian Neural  Networks
1712.02640v1	The problems of outliers detection and robust regression in a high-dimensional setting are fundamental in statistics, and have numerous applications. Following a recent set of works providing methods for simultaneous robust regression and outliers detection, we consider in this paper a model of linear regression with individual intercepts, in a high-dimensional setting. We introduce a new procedure for simultaneous estimation of the linear regression coefficients and intercepts, using two dedicated sorted-$\ell_1$ penalizations, also called SLOPE. We develop a complete theory for this problem: first, we provide sharp upper bounds on the statistical estimation error of both the vector of individual intercepts and regression coefficients. Second, we give an asymptotic control on the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and statistical power for support selection of the individual intercepts. As a consequence, this paper is the first to introduce a procedure with guaranteed FDR and statistical power control for outliers detection under the mean-shift model. Numerical illustrations, with a comparison to recent alternative approaches, are provided on both simulated and several real-world datasets. Experiments are conducted using an open-source software written in Python and C++.	High-dimensional robust regression and outliers detection with SLOPE
1704.04833v1	Boosting as gradient descent algorithms is one popular method in machine learning. In this paper a novel Boosting-type algorithm is proposed based on restricted gradient descent with structural sparsity control whose underlying dynamics are governed by differential inclusions. In particular, we present an iterative regularization path with structural sparsity where the parameter is sparse under some linear transforms, based on variable splitting and the Linearized Bregman Iteration. Hence it is called \emph{Split LBI}. Despite its simplicity, Split LBI outperforms the popular generalized Lasso in both theory and experiments. A theory of path consistency is presented that equipped with a proper early stopping, Split LBI may achieve model selection consistency under a family of Irrepresentable Conditions which can be weaker than the necessary and sufficient condition for generalized Lasso. Furthermore, some $\ell_2$ error bounds are also given at the minimax optimal rates. The utility and benefit of the algorithm are illustrated by several applications including image denoising, partial order ranking of sport teams, and world university grouping with crowdsourced ranking data.

1602.05003v6	Circular variables arise in a multitude of data-modelling contexts ranging from robotics to the social sciences, but they have been largely overlooked by the machine learning community. This paper partially redresses this imbalance by extending some standard probabilistic modelling tools to the circular domain. First we introduce a new multivariate distribution over circular variables, called the multivariate Generalised von Mises (mGvM) distribution. This distribution can be constructed by restricting and renormalising a general multivariate Gaussian distribution to the unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed multivariate circular distributions are shown to be special cases of this construction. Second, we introduce a new probabilistic model for circular regression, that is inspired by Gaussian Processes, and a method for probabilistic principal component analysis with circular hidden variables. These models can leverage standard modelling tools (e.g. covariance functions and methods for automatic relevance determination). Third, we show that the posterior distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution which enables development of an efficient variational free-energy scheme for performing approximate inference and approximate maximum-likelihood learning.

1103.0942v2	We derive generalization error bounds for stationary univariate autoregressive (AR) models. We show that imposing stationarity is enough to control the Gaussian complexity without further regularization. This lets us use structural risk minimization for model selection. We demonstrate our methods by predicting interest rate movements.	Generalization error bounds for stationary autoregressive models
1309.1194v1	We describe ways to define and calculate $L_1$-norm signal subspaces which are less sensitive to outlying data than $L_2$-calculated subspaces. We focus on the computation of the $L_1$ maximum-projection principal component of a data matrix containing N signal samples of dimension D and conclude that the general problem is formally NP-hard in asymptotically large N, D. We prove, however, that the case of engineering interest of fixed dimension D and asymptotically large sample support N is not and we present an optimal algorithm of complexity $O(N^D)$. We generalize to multiple $L_1$-max-projection components and present an explicit optimal $L_1$ subspace calculation algorithm in the form of matrix nuclear-norm evaluations. We conclude with illustrations of $L_1$-subspace signal processing in the fields of data dimensionality reduction and direction-of-arrival estimation.	Some Options for L1-Subspace Signal Processing
1706.01445v3	Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an effective approach for black-box function optimization problems when function evaluations are expensive and the optimum can be achieved within a relatively small number of queries. However, many cases, such as the ones with high-dimensional inputs, may require a much larger number of observations for optimization. Despite an abundance of observations thanks to parallel experiments, current BO techniques have been limited to merely a few thousand observations. In this paper, we propose ensemble Bayesian optimization (EBO) to address three current challenges in BO simultaneously: (1) large-scale observations; (2) high dimensional input spaces; and (3) selections of batch queries that balance quality and diversity. The key idea of EBO is to operate on an ensemble of additive Gaussian process models, each of which possesses a randomized strategy to divide and conquer. We show unprecedented, previously impossible results of scaling up BO to tens of thousands of observations within minutes of computation.	Batched Large-scale Bayesian Optimization in High-dimensional Spaces
1702.04407v4	Flow cytometry is a high-throughput technology used to quantify multiple surface and intracellular markers at the level of a single cell. This enables to identify cell sub-types, and to determine their relative proportions. Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells from a blood sample using multiple markers. This results in high-dimensional datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent (e.g. longitudinal studies). Here, we propose to use a Bayesian nonparametric approach with Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of multivariate skew $t$-distributions to perform model based clustering of flow-cytometry data. DPM models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding model selection issues, and skew $t$-distributions provides robustness to outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the DALIA-1 data. We have made the method available for the community in the R package NPflow.

1411.4834v1	In this article, we derive a new stepsize adaptation for the normalized least mean square algorithm (NLMS) by describing the task of linear acoustic echo cancellation from a Bayesian network perspective. Similar to the well-known Kalman filter equations, we model the acoustic wave propagation from the loudspeaker to the microphone by a latent state vector and define a linear observation equation (to model the relation between the state vector and the observation) as well as a linear process equation (to model the temporal progress of the state vector). Based on additional assumptions on the statistics of the random variables in observation and process equation, we apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to derive an NLMS-like filter adaptation. By exploiting the conditional independence rules for Bayesian networks, we reveal that the resulting EM-NLMS algorithm has a stepsize update equivalent to the optimal-stepsize calculation proposed by Yamamoto and Kitayama in 1982, which has been adopted in many textbooks. As main difference, the instantaneous stepsize value is estimated in the M step of the EM algorithm (instead of being approximated by artificially extending the acoustic echo path). The EM-NLMS algorithm is experimentally verified for synthesized scenarios with both, white noise and male speech as input signal.

1403.4206v1	We present a nonparametric prior over reversible Markov chains. We use completely random measures, specifically gamma processes, to construct a countably infinite graph with weighted edges. By enforcing symmetry to make the edges undirected we define a prior over random walks on graphs that results in a reversible Markov chain. The resulting prior over infinite transition matrices is closely related to the hierarchical Dirichlet process but enforces reversibility. A reinforcement scheme has recently been proposed with similar properties, but the de Finetti measure is not well characterised. We take the alternative approach of explicitly constructing the mixing measure, which allows more straightforward and efficient inference at the cost of no longer having a closed form predictive distribution. We use our process to construct a reversible infinite HMM which we apply to two real datasets, one from epigenomics and one ion channel recording.

1712.09277v1	Classification in the dissimilarity space has become a very active research area since it provides a possibility to learn from data given in the form of pairwise non-metric dissimilarities, which otherwise would be difficult to cope with. The selection of prototypes is a key step for the further creation of the space. However, despite previous efforts to find good prototypes, how to select the best representation set remains an open issue. In this paper we proposed scalable methods to select the set of prototypes out of very large datasets. The methods are based on genetic algorithms, dissimilarity-based hashing, and two different unsupervised and supervised scalable criteria. The unsupervised criterion is based on the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph created by the prototypes as nodes and the dissimilarities as edges. The supervised criterion is based on counting matching labels of objects and their closest prototypes. The suitability of these type of algorithms is analyzed for the specific case of dissimilarity representations. The experimental results showed that the methods select good prototypes taking advantage of the large datasets, and they do so at low runtimes.	Scalable Prototype Selection by Genetic Algorithms and Hashing
1311.2520v3	In Stochastic blockmodels, which are among the most prominent statistical models for cluster analysis of complex networks, clusters are defined as groups of nodes with statistically similar link probabilities within and between groups. A recent extension by Karrer and Newman incorporates a node degree correction to model degree heterogeneity within each group. Although this demonstrably leads to better performance on several networks it is not obvious whether modelling node degree is always appropriate or necessary. We formulate the degree corrected stochastic blockmodel as a non-parametric Bayesian model, incorporating a parameter to control the amount of degree correction which can then be inferred from data. Additionally, our formulation yields principled ways of inferring the number of groups as well as predicting missing links in the network which can be used to quantify the model's predictive performance. On synthetic data we demonstrate that including the degree correction yields better performance both on recovering the true group structure and predicting missing links when degree heterogeneity is present, whereas performance is on par for data with no degree heterogeneity within clusters. On seven real networks (with no ground truth group structure available) we show that predictive performance is about equal whether or not degree correction is included; however, for some networks significantly fewer clusters are discovered when correcting for degree indicating that the data can be more compactly explained by clusters of heterogenous degree nodes.	The Infinite Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model
1608.01008v3	We study probability measures induced by set functions with constraints. Such measures arise in a variety of real-world settings, where prior knowledge, resource limitations, or other pragmatic considerations impose constraints. We consider the task of rapidly sampling from such constrained measures, and develop fast Markov chain samplers for them. Our first main result is for MCMC sampling from Strongly Rayleigh (SR) measures, for which we present sharp polynomial bounds on the mixing time. As a corollary, this result yields a fast mixing sampler for Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), yielding (to our knowledge) the first provably fast MCMC sampler for DPPs since their inception over four decades ago. Beyond SR measures, we develop MCMC samplers for probabilistic models with hard constraints and identify sufficient conditions under which their chains mix rapidly. We illustrate our claims by empirically verifying the dependence of mixing times on the key factors governing our theoretical bounds.	Fast Mixing Markov Chains for Strongly Rayleigh Measures, DPPs, and  Constrained Sampling
1603.06186v2	"Many real world graphs, such as the graphs of molecules, exhibit structure at multiple different scales, but most existing kernels between graphs are either purely local or purely global in character. In contrast, by building a hierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG kernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of different scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph kernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel), which has the property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two graphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels to subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible, we also introduce a randomized projection procedure, similar to the Nystr\""om method, but for RKHS operators."	The Multiscale Laplacian Graph Kernel
0904.0776v1	This paper applies machine learning techniques to student modeling. It presents a method for discovering high-level student behaviors from a very large set of low-level traces corresponding to problem-solving actions in a learning environment. Basic actions are encoded into sets of domain-dependent attribute-value patterns called cases. Then a domain-independent hierarchical clustering identifies what we call general attitudes, yielding automatic diagnosis expressed in natural language, addressed in principle to teachers. The method can be applied to individual students or to entire groups, like a class. We exhibit examples of this system applied to thousands of students' actions in the domain of algebraic transformations.	Induction of High-level Behaviors from Problem-solving Traces using  Machine Learning Tools
1409.7193v2	Significant attention has been given to minimizing a penalized least squares criterion for estimating sparse solutions to large linear systems of equations. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity and the natural choice is the so-called $l_0$ norm. In this paper we develop a Momentumized Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding (MIST) algorithm for minimizing the resulting non-convex criterion and prove its convergence to a local minimizer. Simulations on large data sets show superior performance of the proposed method to other methods.	MIST: L0 Sparse Linear Regression with Momentum
1509.04681v2	This paper addresses the problem of scalable optimization for L1-regularized conditional Gaussian graphical models. Conditional Gaussian graphical models generalize the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional distributions to model the output network influenced by conditioning input variables. While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation, state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly, fail due to memory constraints for very large problems. In this paper, we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently iterates over two sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared to the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems under memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show that our methods can solve one million dimensional problems to high accuracy in a little over a day on a single machine.

1709.00401v2	We present an inverse probability weighted estimator for survival analysis under informative right censoring. Our estimator has the novel property that it converges to a normal variable at $n^{1/2}$ rate for a large class of censoring probability estimators, including many data-adaptive (e.g., machine learning) prediction methods. We present the formula of the asymptotic variance of the estimator, which allows the computation of asymptotically correct confidence intervals and p-values under data-adaptive estimation of the censoring and treatment probabilities. We demonstrate the asymptotic properties of the estimator in simulation studies, and illustrate its use in a phase III clinical trial for estimating the effect of a novel therapy for the treatment of breast cancer.

1204.4710v2	"We address online linear optimization problems when the possible actions of the decision maker are represented by binary vectors. The regret of the decision maker is the difference between her realized loss and the best loss she would have achieved by picking, in hindsight, the best possible action. Our goal is to understand the magnitude of the best possible (minimax) regret. We study the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback the decision maker receives: full information, and the partial information models of the so-called ""semi-bandit"" and ""bandit"" problems. Combining the Mirror Descent algorithm and the INF (Implicitely Normalized Forecaster) strategy, we are able to prove optimal bounds for the semi-bandit case. We also recover the optimal bounds for the full information setting. In the bandit case we discuss existing results in light of a new lower bound, and suggest a conjecture on the optimal regret in that case. Finally we also prove that the standard exponentially weighted average forecaster is provably suboptimal in the setting of online combinatorial optimization."	Regret in Online Combinatorial Optimization
1704.05786v2	Variational inference approximates the posterior distribution of a probabilistic model with a parameterized density by maximizing a lower bound for the model evidence. Modern solutions fit a flexible approximation with stochastic gradient descent, using Monte Carlo approximation for the gradients. This enables variational inference for arbitrary differentiable probabilistic models, and consequently makes variational inference feasible for probabilistic programming languages. In this work we develop more efficient inference algorithms for the task by considering importance sampling estimates for the gradients. We show how the gradient with respect to the approximation parameters can often be evaluated efficiently without needing to re-compute gradients of the model itself, and then proceed to derive practical algorithms that use importance sampled estimates to speed up computation.We present importance sampled stochastic gradient descent that outperforms standard stochastic gradient descent by a clear margin for a range of models, and provide a justifiable variant of stochastic average gradients for variational inference.	Importance Sampled Stochastic Optimization for Variational Inference
1109.0887v7	We consider the problem of learning a forest of nonlinear decision rules with general loss functions. The standard methods employ boosted decision trees such as Adaboost for exponential loss and Friedman's gradient boosting for general loss. In contrast to these traditional boosting algorithms that treat a tree learner as a black box, the method we propose directly learns decision forests via fully-corrective regularized greedy search using the underlying forest structure. Our method achieves higher accuracy and smaller models than gradient boosting (and Adaboost with exponential loss) on many datasets.	Learning Nonlinear Functions Using Regularized Greedy Forest
1105.0562v2	Structural reliability methods aim at computing the probability of failure of systems with respect to some prescribed performance functions. In modern engineering such functions usually resort to running an expensive-to-evaluate computational model (e.g. a finite element model). In this respect simulation methods, which may require $10^{3-6}$ runs cannot be used directly. Surrogate models such as quadratic response surfaces, polynomial chaos expansions or kriging (which are built from a limited number of runs of the original model) are then introduced as a substitute of the original model to cope with the computational cost. In practice it is almost impossible to quantify the error made by this substitution though. In this paper we propose to use a kriging surrogate of the performance function as a means to build a quasi-optimal importance sampling density. The probability of failure is eventually obtained as the product of an augmented probability computed by substituting the meta-model for the original performance function and a correction term which ensures that there is no bias in the estimation even if the meta-model is not fully accurate. The approach is applied to analytical and finite element reliability problems and proves efficient up to 100 random variables.	Metamodel-based importance sampling for structural reliability analysis
1603.09254v1	Quantitatively assessing relationships between latent variables and observed variables is important for understanding and developing generative models and representation learning. In this paper, we propose latent-observed dissimilarity (LOD) to evaluate the dissimilarity between the probabilistic characteristics of latent and observed variables. We also define four essential types of generative models with different independence/conditional independence configurations. Experiments using tractable real-world data show that LOD can effectively capture the differences between models and reflect the capability for higher layer learning. They also show that the conditional independence of latent variables given observed variables contributes to improving the transmission of information and characteristics from lower layers to higher layers.

1104.0729v4	We introduce new online and batch algorithms that are robust to data with missing features, a situation that arises in many practical applications. In the online setup, we allow for the comparison hypothesis to change as a function of the subset of features that is observed on any given round, extending the standard setting where the comparison hypothesis is fixed throughout. In the batch setup, we present a convex relation of a non-convex problem to jointly estimate an imputation function, used to fill in the values of missing features, along with the classification hypothesis. We prove regret bounds in the online setting and Rademacher complexity bounds for the batch i.i.d. setting. The algorithms are tested on several UCI datasets, showing superior performance over baselines.	Online and Batch Learning Algorithms for Data with Missing Features
1406.7638v1	Estimation of density derivatives is a versatile tool in statistical data analysis. A naive approach is to first estimate the density and then compute its derivative. However, such a two-step approach does not work well because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density-derivative estimator. In this paper, we give a direct method to approximate the density derivative without estimating the density itself. Our proposed estimator allows analytic and computationally efficient approximation of multi-dimensional high-order density derivatives, with the ability that all hyper-parameters can be chosen objectively by cross-validation. We further show that the proposed density-derivative estimator is useful in improving the accuracy of non-parametric KL-divergence estimation via metric learning. The practical superiority of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated in change detection and feature selection.	Direct Density-Derivative Estimation and Its Application in  KL-Divergence Approximation
1703.06177v1	Graph-based semi-supervised learning is one of the most popular methods in machine learning. Some of its theoretical properties such as bounds for the generalization error and the convergence of the graph Laplacian regularizer have been studied in computer science and statistics literatures. However, a fundamental statistical property, the consistency of the estimator from this method has not been proved. In this article, we study the consistency problem under a non-parametric framework. We prove the consistency of graph-based learning in the case that the estimated scores are enforced to be equal to the observed responses for the labeled data. The sample sizes of both labeled and unlabeled data are allowed to grow in this result. When the estimated scores are not required to be equal to the observed responses, a tuning parameter is used to balance the loss function and the graph Laplacian regularizer. We give a counterexample demonstrating that the estimator for this case can be inconsistent. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies.	On Consistency of Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning
1607.01369v3	Given a graph in which a few vertices are deemed interesting a priori, the vertex nomination task is to order the remaining vertices into a nomination list such that there is a concentration of interesting vertices at the top of the list. Previous work has yielded several approaches to this problem, with theoretical results in the setting where the graph is drawn from a stochastic block model (SBM), including a vertex nomination analogue of the Bayes optimal classifier. In this paper, we prove that maximum likelihood (ML)-based vertex nomination is consistent, in the sense that the performance of the ML-based scheme asymptotically matches that of the Bayes optimal scheme. We prove theorems of this form both when model parameters are known and unknown. Additionally, we introduce and prove consistency of a related, more scalable restricted-focus ML vertex nomination scheme. Finally, we incorporate vertex and edge features into ML-based vertex nomination and briefly explore the empirical effectiveness of this approach.

1205.2623v1	In a typical online learning scenario, a learner is required to process a large data stream using a small memory buffer. Such a requirement is usually in conflict with a learner's primary pursuit of prediction accuracy. To address this dilemma, we introduce a novel Bayesian online classi cation algorithm, called the Virtual Vector Machine. The virtual vector machine allows you to smoothly trade-off prediction accuracy with memory size. The virtual vector machine summarizes the information contained in the preceding data stream by a Gaussian distribution over the classi cation weights plus a constant number of virtual data points. The virtual data points are designed to add extra non-Gaussian information about the classi cation weights. To maintain the constant number of virtual points, the virtual vector machine adds the current real data point into the virtual point set, merges two most similar virtual points into a new virtual point or deletes a virtual point that is far from the decision boundary. The information lost in this process is absorbed into the Gaussian distribution. The extra information provided by the virtual points leads to improved predictive accuracy over previous online classification algorithms.	Virtual Vector Machine for Bayesian Online Classification
1710.05101v1	We introduce a methodology for efficiently computing a lower bound to empowerment, allowing it to be used as an unsupervised cost function for policy learning in real-time control. Empowerment, being the channel capacity between actions and states, maximises the influence of an agent on its near future. It has been shown to be a good model of biological behaviour in the absence of an extrinsic goal. But empowerment is also prohibitively hard to compute, especially in nonlinear continuous spaces. We introduce an efficient, amortised method for learning empowerment-maximising policies. We demonstrate that our algorithm can reliably handle continuous dynamical systems using system dynamics learned from raw data. The resulting policies consistently drive the agents into states where they can use their full potential.	Unsupervised Real-Time Control through Variational Empowerment
1607.03574v4	Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as mixture models, are used for cluster analysis. These models have two types of variables: observable and latent. In cluster analysis, the latent variable is estimated, and it is expected that additional information will improve the accuracy of the estimation of the latent variable. Many proposed learning methods are able to use additional data; these include semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. However, from a statistical point of view, a complex probabilistic model that encompasses both the initial and additional data might be less accurate due to having a higher-dimensional parameter. The present paper presents a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of such a model and clarifies which factor has the greatest effect on its accuracy, the advantages of obtaining additional data, and the disadvantages of increasing the complexity.	Effects of Additional Data on Bayesian Clustering
1409.4366v1	"We are interested in learning causal relationships between pairs of random variables, purely from observational data. To effectively address this task, the state-of-the-art relies on strong assumptions regarding the mechanisms mapping causes to effects, such as invertibility or the existence of additive noise, which only hold in limited situations. On the contrary, this short paper proposes to learn how to perform causal inference directly from data, and without the need of feature engineering. In particular, we pose causality as a kernel mean embedding classification problem, where inputs are samples from arbitrary probability distributions on pairs of random variables, and labels are types of causal relationships. We validate the performance of our method on synthetic and real-world data against the state-of-the-art. Moreover, we submitted our algorithm to the ChaLearn's ""Fast Causation Coefficient Challenge"" competition, with which we won the fastest code prize and ranked third in the overall leaderboard."

1412.8729v2	We provide a general theory of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for inferring high dimensional latent variable models. In particular, we make two contributions: (i) For parameter estimation, we propose a novel high dimensional EM algorithm which naturally incorporates sparsity structure into parameter estimation. With an appropriate initialization, this algorithm converges at a geometric rate and attains an estimator with the (near-)optimal statistical rate of convergence. (ii) Based on the obtained estimator, we propose new inferential procedures for testing hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals for low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. For a broad family of statistical models, our framework establishes the first computationally feasible approach for optimal estimation and asymptotic inference in high dimensions. Our theory is supported by thorough numerical results.	High Dimensional Expectation-Maximization Algorithm: Statistical  Optimization and Asymptotic Normality
1401.2451v1	It is the main goal of this paper to propose a novel method to perform matrix completion on-line. Motivated by a wide variety of applications, ranging from the design of recommender systems to sensor network localization through seismic data reconstruction, we consider the matrix completion problem when entries of the matrix of interest are observed gradually. Precisely, we place ourselves in the situation where the predictive rule should be refined incrementally, rather than recomputed from scratch each time the sample of observed entries increases. The extension of existing matrix completion methods to the sequential prediction context is indeed a major issue in the Big Data era, and yet little addressed in the literature. The algorithm promoted in this article builds upon the Soft Impute approach introduced in Mazumder et al. (2010). The major novelty essentially arises from the use of a randomised technique for both computing and updating the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) involved in the algorithm. Though of disarming simplicity, the method proposed turns out to be very efficient, while requiring reduced computations. Several numerical experiments based on real datasets illustrating its performance are displayed, together with preliminary results giving it a theoretical basis.

1002.4802v2	In a variety of disciplines such as social sciences, psychology, medicine and economics, the recorded data are considered to be noisy measurements of latent variables connected by some causal structure. This corresponds to a family of graphical models known as the structural equation model with latent variables. While linear non-Gaussian variants have been well-studied, inference in nonparametric structural equation models is still underdeveloped. We introduce a sparse Gaussian process parameterization that defines a non-linear structure connecting latent variables, unlike common formulations of Gaussian process latent variable models. The sparse parameterization is given a full Bayesian treatment without compromising Markov chain Monte Carlo efficiency. We compare the stability of the sampling procedure and the predictive ability of the model against the current practice.	Gaussian Process Structural Equation Models with Latent Variables
1603.09584v1	Extremes play a special role in Anomaly Detection. Beyond inference and simulation purposes, probabilistic tools borrowed from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), such as the angular measure, can also be used to design novel statistical learning methods for Anomaly Detection/ranking. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on multivariate EVT to learn how to rank observations in a high dimensional space with respect to their degree of 'abnormality'. The procedure relies on an original dimension-reduction technique in the extreme domain that possibly produces a sparse representation of multivariate extremes and allows to gain insight into the dependence structure thereof, escaping the curse of dimensionality. The representation output by the unsupervised methodology we propose here can be combined with any Anomaly Detection technique tailored to non-extreme data. As it performs linearly with the dimension and almost linearly in the data (in O(dn log n)), it fits to large scale problems. The approach in this paper is novel in that EVT has never been used in its multivariate version in the field of Anomaly Detection. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.	Sparse Representation of Multivariate Extremes with Applications to  Anomaly Ranking
1410.7029v1	Realizations of stochastic process are often observed temporal data or functional data. There are growing interests in classification of dynamic or functional data. The basic feature of functional data is that the functional data have infinite dimensions and are highly correlated. An essential issue for classifying dynamic and functional data is how to effectively reduce their dimension and explore dynamic feature. However, few statistical methods for dynamic data classification have directly used rich dynamic features of the data. We propose to use second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) to model dynamic process and principal differential analysis to estimate constant or time-varying parameters in the ODE. We examine differential dynamic properties of the dynamic system across different conditions including stability and transient-response, which determine how the dynamic systems maintain their functions and performance under a broad range of random internal and external perturbations. We use the parameters in the ODE as features for classifiers. As a proof of principle, the proposed methods are applied to classifying normal and abnormal QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG) data analysis, which is of great clinical values in diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. We show that the ODE-based classification methods in QRS complex classification outperform the currently widely used neural networks with Fourier expansion coefficients of the functional data as their features. We expect that the dynamic model-based classification methods may open a new avenue for functional data classification.	A Novel Statistical Method Based on Dynamic Models for Classification
1701.02071v1	Gaussian graphical model is a graphical representation of the dependence structure for a Gaussian random vector. It is recognized as a powerful tool in different applied fields such as bioinformatics, error-control codes, speech language, information retrieval and others. Gaussian graphical model selection is a statistical problem to identify the Gaussian graphical model from a sample of a given size. Different approaches for Gaussian graphical model selection are suggested in the literature. One of them is based on considering the family of individual conditional independence tests. The application of this approach leads to the construction of a variety of multiple testing statistical procedures for Gaussian graphical model selection. An important characteristic of these procedures is its error rate for a given sample size. In existing literature great attention is paid to the control of error rates for incorrect edge inclusion (Type I error). However, in graphical model selection it is also important to take into account error rates for incorrect edge exclusion (Type II error). To deal with this issue we consider the graphical model selection problem in the framework of the multiple decision theory. The quality of statistical procedures is measured by a risk function with additive losses. Additive losses allow both types of errors to be taken into account. We construct the tests of a Neyman structure for individual hypotheses and combine them to obtain a multiple decision statistical procedure. We show that the obtained procedure is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the linear combination of expected numbers of Type I and Type II errors in the class of unbiased multiple decision procedures.	Optimal statistical decision for Gaussian graphical model selection
1110.1773v4	"Positive definite matrices abound in a dazzling variety of applications. This ubiquity can be in part attributed to their rich geometric structure: positive definite matrices form a self-dual convex cone whose strict interior is a Riemannian manifold. The manifold view is endowed with a ""natural"" distance function while the conic view is not. Nevertheless, drawing motivation from the conic view, we introduce the S-Divergence as a ""natural"" distance-like function on the open cone of positive definite matrices. We motivate the S-divergence via a sequence of results that connect it to the Riemannian distance. In particular, we show that (a) this divergence is the square of a distance; and (b) that it has several geometric properties similar to those of the Riemannian distance, though without being computationally as demanding. The S-divergence is even more intriguing: although nonconvex, we can still compute matrix means and medians using it to global optimality. We complement our results with some numerical experiments illustrating our theorems and our optimization algorithm for computing matrix medians."	Positive definite matrices and the S-divergence
1410.6834v2	In this paper we propose the first non-parametric Bayesian model using Gaussian Processes to make inference on Poisson Point Processes without resorting to gridding the domain or to introducing latent thinning points. Unlike competing models that scale cubically and have a squared memory requirement in the number of data points, our model has a linear complexity and memory requirement. We propose an MCMC sampler and show that our model is faster, more accurate and generates less correlated samples than competing models on both synthetic and real-life data. Finally, we show that our model easily handles data sizes not considered thus far by alternate approaches.	Scalable Nonparametric Bayesian Inference on Point Processes with  Gaussian Processes
1003.0060v1	This comment reexamines Simard et al.'s work in [D. Simard, L. Nadeau, H. Kroger, Phys. Lett. A 336 (2005) 8-15]. We found that Simard et al. calculated mistakenly the local connectivity lengths Dlocal of networks. The right results of Dlocal are presented and the supervised learning performance of feedforward neural networks (FNNs) with different rewirings are re-investigated in this comment. This comment discredits Simard et al's work by two conclusions: 1) Rewiring connections of FNNs cannot generate networks with small-world connectivity; 2) For different training sets, there do not exist networks with a certain number of rewirings generating reduced learning errors than networks with other numbers of rewiring.

1103.4296v2	We analyze convergence rates of stochastic optimization procedures for non-smooth convex optimization problems. By combining randomized smoothing techniques with accelerated gradient methods, we obtain convergence rates of stochastic optimization procedures, both in expectation and with high probability, that have optimal dependence on the variance of the gradient estimates. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first variance-based rates for non-smooth optimization. We give several applications of our results to statistical estimation problems, and provide experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We also describe how a combination of our algorithm with recent work on decentralized optimization yields a distributed stochastic optimization algorithm that is order-optimal.	Randomized Smoothing for Stochastic Optimization
1509.01631v1	"While stochastic variational inference is relatively well known for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models, related methods also offer ways to circumnavigate the approximation of analytically intractable expectations. The key challenge in either setting is controlling the variance of gradient estimates: recent work has shown that for continuous latent variables, particularly multivariate Gaussians, this can be achieved by using the gradient of the log posterior. In this paper we apply the same idea to gamma distributed latent variables given gamma variational distributions, enabling straightforward ""black box"" variational inference in models where sparsity and non-negativity are appropriate. We demonstrate the method on a recently proposed gamma process model for network data, as well as a novel sparse factor analysis. We outperform generic sampling algorithms and the approach of using Gaussian variational distributions on transformed variables."	Stochastic gradient variational Bayes for gamma approximating  distributions
1305.4893v1	We consider the problem of vertex classification for graphs constructed from the latent position model. It was shown previously that the approach of embedding the graphs into some Euclidean space followed by classification in that space can yields a universally consistent vertex classifier. However, a major technical difficulty of the approach arises when classifying unlabeled out-of-sample vertices without including them in the embedding stage. In this paper, we studied the out-of-sample extension for the graph embedding step and its impact on the subsequent inference tasks. We show that, under the latent position graph model and for sufficiently large $n$, the mapping of the out-of-sample vertices is close to its true latent position. We then demonstrate that successful inference for the out-of-sample vertices is possible.	Out-of-sample Extension for Latent Position Graphs
1008.3572v1	A topological approach to stratification learning is developed for point cloud data drawn from a stratified space. Given such data, our objective is to infer which points belong to the same strata. First we define a multi-scale notion of a stratified space, giving a stratification for each radius level. We then use methods derived from kernel and cokernel persistent homology to cluster the data points into different strata, and we prove a result which guarantees the correctness of our clustering, given certain topological conditions; some geometric intuition for these topological conditions is also provided. Our correctness result is then given a probabilistic flavor: we give bounds on the minimum number of sample points required to infer, with probability, which points belong to the same strata. Finally, we give an explicit algorithm for the clustering, prove its correctness, and apply it to some simulated data.	Towards Stratification Learning through Homology Inference
1702.05289v2	This paper introduces a method for efficiently inferring a high-dimensional distributed quantity from a few observations. The quantity of interest (QoI) is approximated in a basis (dictionary) learned from a training set. The coefficients associated with the approximation of the QoI in the basis are determined by minimizing the misfit with the observations. To obtain a probabilistic estimate of the quantity of interest, a Bayesian approach is employed. The QoI is treated as a random field endowed with a hierarchical prior distribution so that closed-form expressions can be obtained for the posterior distribution. The main contribution of the present work lies in the derivation of \emph{a representation basis consistent with the observation chain} used to infer the associated coefficients. The resulting dictionary is then tailored to be both observable by the sensors and accurate in approximating the posterior mean. An algorithm for deriving such an observable dictionary is presented. The method is illustrated with the estimation of the velocity field of an open cavity flow from a handful of wall-mounted point sensors. Comparison with standard estimation approaches relying on Principal Component Analysis and K-SVD dictionaries is provided and illustrates the superior performance of the present approach.	Observable dictionary learning for high-dimensional statistical  inference
1306.4960v5	We provide theoretical analysis of the statistical and computational properties of penalized $M$-estimators that can be formulated as the solution to a possibly nonconvex optimization problem. Many important estimators fall in this category, including least squares regression with nonconvex regularization, generalized linear models with nonconvex regularization and sparse elliptical random design regression. For these problems, it is intractable to calculate the global solution due to the nonconvex formulation. In this paper, we propose an approximate regularization path-following method for solving a variety of learning problems with nonconvex objective functions. Under a unified analytic framework, we simultaneously provide explicit statistical and computational rates of convergence for any local solution attained by the algorithm. Computationally, our algorithm attains a global geometric rate of convergence for calculating the full regularization path, which is optimal among all first-order algorithms. Unlike most existing methods that only attain geometric rates of convergence for one single regularization parameter, our algorithm calculates the full regularization path with the same iteration complexity. In particular, we provide a refined iteration complexity bound to sharply characterize the performance of each stage along the regularization path. Statistically, we provide sharp sample complexity analysis for all the approximate local solutions along the regularization path. In particular, our analysis improves upon existing results by providing a more refined sample complexity bound as well as an exact support recovery result for the final estimator. These results show that the final estimator attains an oracle statistical property due to the usage of nonconvex penalty.

1709.09102v1	"This paper presents a new approach to non-parametric cluster analysis called Adaptive Weights Clustering (AWC). The idea is to identify the clustering structure by checking at different points and for different scales on departure from local homogeneity. The proposed procedure describes the clustering structure in terms of weights \( w_{ij} \) each of them measures the degree of local inhomogeneity for two neighbor local clusters using statistical tests of ""no gap"" between them. % The procedure starts from very local scale, then the parameter of locality grows by some factor at each step. The method is fully adaptive and does not require to specify the number of clusters or their structure. The clustering results are not sensitive to noise and outliers, the procedure is able to recover different clusters with sharp edges or manifold structure. The method is scalable and computationally feasible. An intensive numerical study shows a state-of-the-art performance of the method in various artificial examples and applications to text data. Our theoretical study states optimal sensitivity of AWC to local inhomogeneity."	Adaptive Nonparametric Clustering
1705.10813v3	Gaussian processes (GPs), or distributions over arbitrary functions in a continuous domain, can be generalized to the multi-output case: a linear model of coregionalization (LMC) is one approach. LMCs estimate and exploit correlations across the multiple outputs. While model estimation can be performed efficiently for single-output GPs, these assume stationarity, but in the multi-output case the cross-covariance interaction is not stationary. We propose Large Linear GP (LLGP), which circumvents the need for stationarity by inducing structure in the LMC kernel through a common grid of inputs shared between outputs, enabling optimization of GP hyperparameters for multi-dimensional outputs and low-dimensional inputs. When applied to synthetic two-dimensional and real time series data, we find our theoretical improvement relative to the current solutions for multi-output GPs is realized with LLGP reducing training time while improving or maintaining predictive mean accuracy. Moreover, by using a direct likelihood approximation rather than a variational one, model confidence estimates are significantly improved.	Large Linear Multi-output Gaussian Process Learning
1105.5669v3	"In response to a 1997 problem of M. Vidyasagar, we state a criterion for PAC learnability of a concept class $\mathscr C$ under the family of all non-atomic (diffuse) measures on the domain $\Omega$. The uniform Glivenko--Cantelli property with respect to non-atomic measures is no longer a necessary condition, and consistent learnability cannot in general be expected. Our criterion is stated in terms of a combinatorial parameter $\VC({\mathscr C}\,{\mathrm{mod}}\,\omega_1)$ which we call the VC dimension of $\mathscr C$ modulo countable sets. The new parameter is obtained by ""thickening up"" single points in the definition of VC dimension to uncountable ""clusters"". Equivalently, $\VC(\mathscr C\modd\omega_1)\leq d$ if and only if every countable subclass of $\mathscr C$ has VC dimension $\leq d$ outside a countable subset of $\Omega$. The new parameter can be also expressed as the classical VC dimension of $\mathscr C$ calculated on a suitable subset of a compactification of $\Omega$. We do not make any measurability assumptions on $\mathscr C$, assuming instead the validity of Martin's Axiom (MA). Similar results are obtained for function learning in terms of fat-shattering dimension modulo countable sets, but, just like in the classical distribution-free case, the finiteness of this parameter is sufficient but not necessary for PAC learnability under non-atomic measures."

1703.08737v1	"Integrating visual and linguistic information into a single multimodal representation is an unsolved problem with wide-reaching applications to both natural language processing and computer vision. In this paper, we present a simple method to build multimodal representations by learning a language-to-vision mapping and using its output to build multimodal embeddings. In this sense, our method provides a cognitively plausible way of building representations, consistent with the inherently re-constructive and associative nature of human memory. Using seven benchmark concept similarity tests we show that the mapped vectors not only implicitly encode multimodal information, but also outperform strong unimodal baselines and state-of-the-art multimodal methods, thus exhibiting more ""human-like"" judgments---particularly in zero-shot settings."

1711.08374v1	In this paper, a scale mixture of Normal distributions model is developed for classification and clustering of data having outliers and missing values. The classification method, based on a mixture model, focuses on the introduction of latent variables that gives us the possibility to handle sensitivity of model to outliers and to allow a less restrictive modelling of missing data. Inference is processed through a Variational Bayesian Approximation and a Bayesian treatment is adopted for model learning, supervised classification and clustering.	Variational Bayesian Inference For A Scale Mixture Of Normal  Distributions Handling Missing Data
1210.7665v2	Many real world network problems often concern multivariate nodal attributes such as image, textual, and multi-view feature vectors on nodes, rather than simple univariate nodal attributes. The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating graphs from multi-attribute data. Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features. Computationally, we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure. Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under various conditions. Furthermore, we provide illustrative applications to uncovering gene regulatory networks from gene and protein profiles, and uncovering brain connectivity graph from functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

1606.05273v1	Regression trees are becoming increasingly popular as omnibus predicting tools and as the basis of numerous modern statistical learning ensembles. Part of their popularity is their ability to create a regression prediction without ever specifying a structure for the mean model. However, the method implicitly assumes homogeneous variance across the entire explanatory-variable space. It is unknown how the algorithm behaves when faced with heteroscedastic data. In this study, we assess the performance of the most popular regression-tree algorithm in a single-variable setting under a very simple step-function model for heteroscedasticity. We use simulation to show that the locations of splits, and hence the ability to accurately predict means, are both adversely influenced by the change in variance. We identify the pruning algorithm as the main concern, although the effects on the splitting algorithm may be meaningful in some applications.	The Effect of Heteroscedasticity on Regression Trees
1801.09386v1	Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is widely used for evaluating diagnostic systems. Recent studies have shown that estimating an area under ROC curve (AUC) with standard cross-validation methods suffers from a large bias. The leave-pair-out (LPO) cross-validation has been shown to correct this bias. However, while LPO produces an almost unbiased estimate of AUC, it does not provide a ranking of the data needed for plotting and analyzing the ROC curve. In this study, we propose a new method called tournament leave-pair-out (TLPO) cross-validation. This method extends LPO by creating a tournament from pair comparisons to produce a ranking for the data. TLPO preserves the advantage of LPO for estimating AUC, while it also allows performing ROC analysis. We have shown using both synthetic and real world data that TLPO is as reliable as LPO for AUC estimation and confirmed the bias in leave-one-out cross-validation on low-dimensional data.

1802.01334v1	Extracting information from functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) has been a major area of research for many years, but is still demanding more accurate techniques. Nowadays, we have a plenty of available information about the brain-behavior that can be used to develop more precise methods. Thus, this paper presents a new Dictionary Learning method that allows incorporating external information regarding the studied problem, through a novel sets of constraints. Finally, we apply this proposed method to synthetic fMRI data, where several tests show an improvement in the performance compared with other common techniques.

1405.3952v1	We propose a new two stage algorithm LING for large scale regression problems. LING has the same risk as the well known Ridge Regression under the fixed design setting and can be computed much faster. Our experiments have shown that LING performs well in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared with other large scale regression algorithms like Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Principal Component Regression on both simulated and real datasets.

1706.08263v1	Data lying in a high-dimensional ambient space are commonly thought to have a much lower intrinsic dimension. In particular, the data may be concentrated near a lower-dimensional subspace or manifold. There is an immense literature focused on approximating the unknown subspace, and in exploiting such approximations in clustering, data compression, and building of predictive models. Most of the literature relies on approximating subspaces using a locally linear, and potentially multiscale, dictionary. In this article, we propose a simple and general alternative, which instead uses pieces of spheres, or spherelets, to locally approximate the unknown subspace. Building on this idea, we develop a simple and computationally efficient algorithm for subspace learning and clustering. Results relative to state-of-the-art competitors show dramatic gains in ability to accurately approximate the subspace with orders of magnitude fewer components. This leads to substantial gains in data compressibility, few clusters and hence better interpretability, and much lower MSE based on small to moderate sample sizes. Basic theory on approximation accuracy is presented, and the methods are applied to multiple examples.	Efficient Manifold and Subspace Approximations with Spherelets
1605.07906v2	The hyperparameters in Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with a specified kernel are often estimated from the data via the maximum marginal likelihood. Due to the non-convexity of marginal likelihood with respect to the hyperparameters, the optimization may not converge to the global maxima. A common approach to tackle this issue is to use multiple starting points randomly selected from a specific prior distribution. As a result the choice of prior distribution may play a vital role in the predictability of this approach. However, there exists little research in the literature to study the impact of the prior distributions on the hyperparameter estimation and the performance of GPR. In this paper, we provide the first empirical study on this problem using simulated and real data experiments. We consider different types of priors for the initial values of hyperparameters for some commonly used kernels and investigate the influence of the priors on the predictability of GPR models. The results reveal that, once a kernel is chosen, different priors for the initial hyperparameters have no significant impact on the performance of GPR prediction, despite that the estimates of the hyperparameters are very different to the true values in some cases.	How priors of initial hyperparameters affect Gaussian process regression  models
1401.4408v1	Visual rendering of graphs is a key task in the mapping of complex network data. Although most graph drawing algorithms emphasize aesthetic appeal, certain applications such as travel-time maps place more importance on visualization of structural network properties. The present paper advocates two graph embedding approaches with centrality considerations to comply with node hierarchy. The problem is formulated first as one of constrained multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and it is solved via block coordinate descent iterations with successive approximations and guaranteed convergence to a KKT point. In addition, a regularization term enforcing graph smoothness is incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. A second approach leverages the locally-linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which assumes that the graph encodes data sampled from a low-dimensional manifold. Closed-form solutions to the resulting centrality-constrained optimization problems are determined yielding meaningful embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both approaches, especially for visualizing large networks on the order of thousands of nodes.

1103.4480v1	We consider a collection of prediction experiments, which are clustered in the sense that groups of experiments ex- hibit similar relationship between the predictor and response variables. The experiment clusters as well as the regres- sion relationships are unknown. The regression relation- ships define the experiment clusters, and in general, the predictor and response variables may not exhibit any clus- tering. We call this prediction problem clustered regres- sion with unknown clusters (CRUC) and in this paper we focus on linear regression. We study and compare several methods for CRUC, demonstrate their applicability to the Yahoo Learning-to-rank Challenge (YLRC) dataset, and in- vestigate an associated mathematical model. CRUC is at the crossroads of many prior works and we study several prediction algorithms with diverse origins: an adaptation of the expectation-maximization algorithm, an approach in- spired by K-means clustering, the singular value threshold- ing approach to matrix rank minimization under quadratic constraints, an adaptation of the Curds and Whey method in multiple regression, and a local regression (LoR) scheme reminiscent of neighborhood methods in collaborative filter- ing. Based on empirical evaluation on the YLRC dataset as well as simulated data, we identify the LoR method as a good practical choice: it yields best or near-best prediction performance at a reasonable computational load, and it is less sensitive to the choice of the algorithm parameter. We also provide some analysis of the LoR method for an asso- ciated mathematical model, which sheds light on optimal parameter choice and prediction performance.	Clustered regression with unknown clusters
1409.2713v1	Log-linear models are the popular workhorses of analyzing contingency tables. A log-linear parameterization of an interaction model can be more expressive than a direct parameterization based on probabilities, leading to a powerful way of defining restrictions derived from marginal, conditional and context-specific independence. However, parameter estimation is often simpler under a direct parameterization, provided that the model enjoys certain decomposability properties. Here we introduce a cyclical projection algorithm for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of log-linear parameters under an arbitrary context-specific graphical log-linear model, which needs not satisfy criteria of decomposability. We illustrate that lifting the restriction of decomposability makes the models more expressive, such that additional context-specific independencies embedded in real data can be identified. It is also shown how a context-specific graphical model can correspond to a non-hierarchical log-linear parameterization with a concise interpretation. This observation can pave way to further development of non-hierarchical log-linear models, which have been largely neglected due to their believed lack of interpretability.

1706.07834v1	We adopt data structure in the form of cover trees and iteratively apply approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) searches for fast compressed sensing reconstruction of signals living on discrete smooth manifolds. Levering on the recent stability results for the inexact Iterative Projected Gradient (IPG) algorithm and by using the cover tree's ANN searches, we decrease the projection cost of the IPG algorithm to be logarithmically growing with data population for low dimensional smooth manifolds. We apply our results to quantitative MRI compressed sensing and in particular within the Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) framework. For a similar (or sometimes better) reconstruction accuracy, we report 2-3 orders of magnitude reduction in computations compared to the standard iterative method which uses brute-force searches.

1503.02698v2	In high dimensions we propose and analyze an aggregation estimator of the precision matrix for Gaussian graphical models. This estimator, called graphical Exponential Screening (gES), linearly combines a suitable set of individual estimators with different underlying graphs, and balances the estimation error and sparsity. We study the risk of this aggregation estimator and show that it is comparable to that of the best estimator based on a single graph, chosen by an oracle. Numerical performance of our method is investigated using both simulated and real datasets, in comparison with some state-of-art estimation procedures.	Graphical Exponential Screening
1802.02343v1	Correlated component analysis as proposed by Dmochowski et al. (2012) is a tool for investigating brain process similarity in the responses to multiple views of a given stimulus. Correlated components are identified under the assumption that the involved spatial networks are identical. Here we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that can infer the level of universality in such multi-view data, from completely unrelated representations, corresponding to canonical correlation analysis, to identical representations as in correlated component analysis. This new model, which we denote Bayesian correlated component analysis, evaluates favourably against three relevant algorithms in simulated data. A well-established benchmark EEG dataset is used to further validate the new model and infer the variability of spatial representations across multiple subjects.

1610.08074v1	In this paper we investigate a link between state- space models and Gaussian Processes (GP) for time series modeling and forecasting. In particular, several widely used state- space models are transformed into continuous time form and corresponding Gaussian Process kernels are derived. Experimen- tal results demonstrate that the derived GP kernels are correct and appropriate for Gaussian Process Regression. An experiment with a real world dataset shows that the modeling is identical with state-space models and with the proposed GP kernels. The considered connection allows the researchers to look at their models from a different angle and facilitate sharing ideas between these two different modeling approaches.

1712.03638v1	We study the problem of recovering a structured signal $\mathbf{x}_0$ from high-dimensional measurements of the form $y=f(\mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x}_0)$ for some nonlinear function $f$. When the measurement vector $\mathbf a$ is iid Gaussian, Brillinger observed in his 1982 paper that $\mu_\ell\cdot\mathbf{x}_0 = \min_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbb{E}(y - \mathbf{a}^T\mathbf{x})^2$, where $\mu_\ell=\mathbb{E}_{\gamma}[\gamma f(\gamma)]$ with $\gamma$ being a standard Gaussian random variable. Based on this simple observation, he showed that, in the classical statistical setting, the least-squares method is consistent. More recently, Plan \& Vershynin extended this result to the high-dimensional setting and derived error bounds for the generalized Lasso. Unfortunately, both least-squares and the Lasso fail to recover $\mathbf{x}_0$ when $\mu_\ell=0$. For example, this includes all even link functions. We resolve this issue by proposing and analyzing an appropriate generic semidefinite-optimization based method. In a nutshell, our idea is to treat such link functions as if they were linear in a lifted space of higher-dimension. An appealing feature of our error analysis is that it captures the effect of the nonlinearity in a few simple summary parameters, which can be particularly useful in system design.

1203.1269v2	The graphics processing unit (GPU) has emerged as a powerful and cost effective processor for general performance computing. GPUs are capable of an order of magnitude more floating-point operations per second as compared to modern central processing units (CPUs), and thus provide a great deal of promise for computationally intensive statistical applications. Fitting complex statistical models with a large number of parameters and/or for large datasets is often very computationally expensive. In this study, we focus on Gaussian process (GP) models -- statistical models commonly used for emulating expensive computer simulators. We demonstrate that the computational cost of implementing GP models can be significantly reduced by using a CPU+GPU heterogeneous computing system over an analogous implementation on a traditional computing system with no GPU acceleration. Our small study suggests that GP models are fertile ground for further implementation on CPU+GPU systems.	A Short Note on Gaussian Process Modeling for Large Datasets using  Graphics Processing Units
1708.05257v1	Bayesian models that mix multiple Dirichlet prior parameters, called Multi-Dirichlet priors (MD) in this paper, are gaining popularity. Inferring mixing weights and parameters of mixed prior distributions seems tricky, as sums over Dirichlet parameters complicate the joint distribution of model parameters. This paper shows a novel auxiliary variable scheme which helps to simplify the inference for models involving hierarchical MDs and MDPs. Using this scheme, it is easy to derive fully collapsed inference schemes which allow for an efficient inference.	Auxiliary Variables for Multi-Dirichlet Priors
1705.04790v2	In healthcare applications, temporal variables that encode movement, health status and longitudinal patient evolution are often accompanied by rich structured information such as demographics, diagnostics and medical exam data. However, current methods do not jointly optimize over structured covariates and time series in the feature extraction process. We present ShortFuse, a method that boosts the accuracy of deep learning models for time series by explicitly modeling temporal interactions and dependencies with structured covariates. ShortFuse introduces hybrid convolutional and LSTM cells that incorporate the covariates via weights that are shared across the temporal domain. ShortFuse outperforms competing models by 3% on two biomedical applications, forecasting osteoarthritis-related cartilage degeneration and predicting surgical outcomes for cerebral palsy patients, matching or exceeding the accuracy of models that use features engineered by domain experts.

1603.02743v1	Generalised Degrees of Freedom (GDF), as defined by Ye (1998 JASA 93:120-131), represent the sensitivity of model fits to perturbations of the data. As such they can be computed for any statistical model, making it possible, in principle, to derive the number of parameters in machine-learning approaches. Defined originally for normally distributed data only, we here investigate the potential of this approach for Bernoulli-data. GDF-values for models of simulated and real data are compared to model complexity-estimates from cross-validation. Similarly, we computed GDF-based AICc for randomForest, neural networks and boosted regression trees and demonstrated its similarity to cross-validation. GDF-estimates for binary data were unstable and inconsistently sensitive to the number of data points perturbed simultaneously, while at the same time being extremely computer-intensive in their calculation. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation was more robust, based on fewer assumptions and faster to compute. Our findings suggest that the GDF-approach does not readily transfer to Bernoulli data and a wider range of regression approaches.

0902.0392v2	Research in reinforcement learning has produced algorithms for optimal decision making under uncertainty that fall within two main types. The first employs a Bayesian framework, where optimality improves with increased computational time. This is because the resulting planning task takes the form of a dynamic programming problem on a belief tree with an infinite number of states. The second type employs relatively simple algorithm which are shown to suffer small regret within a distribution-free framework. This paper presents a lower bound and a high probability upper bound on the optimal value function for the nodes in the Bayesian belief tree, which are analogous to similar bounds in POMDPs. The bounds are then used to create more efficient strategies for exploring the tree. The resulting algorithms are compared with the distribution-free algorithm UCB1, as well as a simpler baseline algorithm on multi-armed bandit problems.	Tree Exploration for Bayesian RL Exploration
1306.5860v1	We introduce Supersparse Linear Integer Models (SLIM) as a tool to create scoring systems for binary classification. We derive theoretical bounds on the true risk of SLIM scoring systems, and present experimental results to show that SLIM scoring systems are accurate, sparse, and interpretable classification models.	Supersparse Linear Integer Models for Predictive Scoring Systems
1006.3640v2	Density modeling is notoriously difficult for high dimensional data. One approach to the problem is to search for a lower dimensional manifold which captures the main characteristics of the data. Recently, the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) has successfully been used to find low dimensional manifolds in a variety of complex data. The GPLVM consists of a set of points in a low dimensional latent space, and a stochastic map to the observed space. We show how it can be interpreted as a density model in the observed space. However, the GPLVM is not trained as a density model and therefore yields bad density estimates. We propose a new training strategy and obtain improved generalisation performance and better density estimates in comparative evaluations on several benchmark data sets.

1404.5793v2	We focus on an interpolation method referred to Bayesian reconstruction in this paper. Whereas in standard interpolation methods missing data are interpolated deterministically, in Bayesian reconstruction, missing data are interpolated probabilistically using a Bayesian treatment. In this paper, we address the framework of Bayesian reconstruction and its application to the traffic data reconstruction problem in the field of traffic engineering. In the latter part of this paper, we describe the evaluation of the statistical performance of our Bayesian traffic reconstruction model using a statistical mechanical approach and clarify its statistical behavior.	Bayesian Reconstruction of Missing Observations
1601.00504v1	The aim of this paper is to provide a new method for learning the relationships between data that have been obtained independently. Unlike existing methods like matching, the proposed technique does not require any contextual information, provided that the dependency between the variables of interest is monotone. It can therefore be easily combined with matching in order to exploit the advantages of both methods. This technique can be described as a mix between quantile matching, and deconvolution. We provide for it a theoretical and an empirical validation.	Learning relationships between data obtained independently
1505.08052v4	The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for efficient exploration of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These facilities could be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. E.g. in biological experiments many experimental set ups allow several samples to be simultaneously processed. Batch methods, however, require modeling of the interaction between the evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate a simple heuristic based on an estimate of the Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction (i.e. local repulsion) at negligible computational overhead. The resulting algorithm compares well, in running time, with much more elaborate alternatives. The approach assumes that the function of interest, $f$, is a Lipschitz continuous function. A wrap-loop around the acquisition function is used to collect batches of points of certain size minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The speed-up of our method with respect to previous approaches is significant in a set of computationally expensive experiments.	Batch Bayesian Optimization via Local Penalization
1112.0611v1	Information-maximization clustering learns a probabilistic classifier in an unsupervised manner so that mutual information between feature vectors and cluster assignments is maximized. A notable advantage of this approach is that it only involves continuous optimization of model parameters, which is substantially easier to solve than discrete optimization of cluster assignments. However, existing methods still involve non-convex optimization problems, and therefore finding a good local optimal solution is not straightforward in practice. In this paper, we propose an alternative information-maximization clustering method based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information. This novel approach gives a clustering solution analytically in a computationally efficient way via kernel eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, we provide a practical model selection procedure that allows us to objectively optimize tuning parameters included in the kernel function. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.	Information-Maximization Clustering based on Squared-Loss Mutual  Information
1203.3494v1	We introduce a new class of lower bounds on the log partition function of a Markov random field which makes use of a reversed Jensen's inequality. In particular, our method approximates the intractable distribution using a linear combination of spanning trees with negative weights. This technique is a lower-bound counterpart to the tree-reweighted belief propagation algorithm, which uses a convex combination of spanning trees with positive weights to provide corresponding upper bounds. We develop algorithms to optimize and tighten the lower bounds over the non-convex set of valid parameter values. Our algorithm generalizes mean field approaches (including naive and structured mean field approximations), which it includes as a limiting case.	Negative Tree Reweighted Belief Propagation
1705.05278v2	Probability distributions produced by the cross-entropy loss for ordinal classification problems can possess undesired properties. We propose a straightforward technique to constrain discrete ordinal probability distributions to be unimodal via the use of the Poisson and binomial probability distributions. We evaluate this approach in the context of deep learning on two large ordinal image datasets, obtaining promising results.	Unimodal probability distributions for deep ordinal classification
1707.02461v2	Given full or partial information about a collection of points that lie close to a union of several subspaces, subspace clustering refers to the process of clustering the points according to their subspace and identifying the subspaces. One popular approach, sparse subspace clustering (SSC), represents each sample as a weighted combination of the other samples, with weights of minimal $\ell_1$ norm, and then uses those learned weights to cluster the samples. SSC is stable in settings where each sample is contaminated by a relatively small amount of noise. However, when there is a significant amount of additive noise, or a considerable number of entries are missing, theoretical guarantees are scarce. In this paper, we study a robust variant of SSC and establish clustering guarantees in the presence of corrupted or missing data. We give explicit bounds on amount of noise and missing data that the algorithm can tolerate, both in deterministic settings and in a random generative model. Notably, our approach provides guarantees for higher tolerance to noise and missing data than existing analyses for this method. By design, the results hold even when we do not know the locations of the missing data; e.g., as in presence-only data.	Subspace Clustering with Missing and Corrupted Data
1611.04067v2	Spectral dimensionality reduction is frequently used to identify low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data. However, learning manifolds, especially from the streaming data, is computationally and memory expensive. In this paper, we argue that a stable manifold can be learned using only a fraction of the stream, and the remaining stream can be mapped to the manifold in a significantly less costly manner. Identifying the transition point at which the manifold is stable is the key step. We present error metrics that allow us to identify the transition point for a given stream by quantitatively assessing the quality of a manifold learned using Isomap. We further propose an efficient mapping algorithm, called S-Isomap, that can be used to map new samples onto the stable manifold. We describe experiments on a variety of data sets that show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy.	Error Metrics for Learning Reliable Manifolds from Streaming Data
1703.01872v2	Inspired by the importance of diversity in biological system, we built an heterogeneous system that could achieve this goal. Our architecture could be summarized in two basic steps. First, we generate a diverse set of classification hypothesis using both Convolutional Neural Networks, currently the state-of-the-art technique for this task, among with other traditional and innovative machine learning techniques. Then, we optimally combine them through Meta-Nets, a family of recently developed and performing ensemble methods.	Computational Eco-Systems for Handwritten Digits Recognition
1610.08813v1	"This paper proposes a subspace decomposition method based on an over-complete dictionary in sparse representation, called ""Sparse Signal Subspace Decomposition"" (or 3SD) method. This method makes use of a novel criterion based on the occurrence frequency of atoms of the dictionary over the data set. This criterion, well adapted to subspace-decomposition over a dependent basis set, adequately re ects the intrinsic characteristic of regularity of the signal. The 3SD method combines variance, sparsity and component frequency criteria into an unified framework. It takes benefits from using an over-complete dictionary which preserves details and from subspace decomposition which rejects strong noise. The 3SD method is very simple with a linear retrieval operation. It does not require any prior knowledge on distributions or parameters. When applied to image denoising, it demonstrates high performances both at preserving fine details and suppressing strong noise."	Sparse Signal Subspace Decomposition Based on Adaptive Over-complete  Dictionary
1605.04955v2	Many complex ecosystems, such as those formed by multiple microbial taxa, involve intricate interactions amongst various sub-communities. The most basic relationships are frequently modeled as co-occurrence networks in which the nodes represent the various players in the community and the weighted edges encode levels of interaction. In this setting, the composition of a community may be viewed as a probability distribution on the nodes of the network. This paper develops methods for modeling the organization of such data, as well as their Euclidean counterparts, across spatial scales. Using the notion of diffusion distance, we introduce diffusion Frechet functions and diffusion Frechet vectors associated with probability distributions on Euclidean space and the vertex set of a weighted network, respectively. We prove that these functional statistics are stable with respect to the Wasserstein distance between probability measures, thus yielding robust descriptors of their shapes. We apply the methodology to investigate bacterial communities in the human gut, seeking to characterize divergence from intestinal homeostasis in patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation, a treatment used in CDI patients that has proven to be significantly more effective than traditional treatment with antibiotics. The proposed method proves useful in deriving a biomarker that might help elucidate the mechanisms that drive these processes.	Probing the Geometry of Data with Diffusion Fréchet Functions
1108.2820v2	"In medical risk modeling, typical data are ""scarce"": they have relatively small number of training instances (N), censoring, and high dimensionality (M). We show that the problem may be effectively simplified by reducing it to bipartite ranking, and introduce new bipartite ranking algorithm, Smooth Rank, for robust learning on scarce data. The algorithm is based on ensemble learning with unsupervised aggregation of predictors. The advantage of our approach is confirmed in comparison with two ""gold standard"" risk modeling methods on 10 real life survival analysis datasets, where the new approach has the best results on all but two datasets with the largest ratio N/M. For systematic study of the effects of data scarcity on modeling by all three methods, we conducted two types of computational experiments: on real life data with randomly drawn training sets of different sizes, and on artificial data with increasing number of features. Both experiments demonstrated that Smooth Rank has critical advantage over the popular methods on the scarce data; it does not suffer from overfitting where other methods do."

1204.0585v4	"This paper studies iteration convergence of Kronecker graphical lasso (KGLasso) algorithms for estimating the covariance of an i.i.d. Gaussian random sample under a sparse Kronecker-product covariance model and MSE convergence rates. The KGlasso model, originally called the transposable regularized covariance model by Allen [""Transposable regularized covariance models with an application to missing data imputation,"" Ann. Appl. Statist., vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 764-790, 2010], implements a pair of $\ell_1$ penalties on each Kronecker factor to enforce sparsity in the covariance estimator. The KGlasso algorithm generalizes Glasso, introduced by Yuan and Lin [""Model selection and estimation in the Gaussian graphical model,"" Biometrika, vol. 94, pp. 19-35, 2007] and Banerjee [""Model selection through sparse maximum likelihood estimation for multivariate Gaussian or binary data,"" J. Mach. Learn. Res., vol. 9, pp. 485-516, Mar. 2008], to estimate covariances having Kronecker product form. It also generalizes the unpenalized ML flip-flop (FF) algorithm of Dutilleul [""The MLE algorithm for the matrix normal distribution,"" J. Statist. Comput. Simul., vol. 64, pp. 105-123, 1999] and Werner [""On estimation of covariance matrices with Kronecker product structure,"" IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 56, no. 2, pp. 478-491, Feb. 2008] to estimation of sparse Kronecker factors. We establish that the KGlasso iterates converge pointwise to a local maximum of the penalized likelihood function. We derive high dimensional rates of convergence to the true covariance as both the number of samples and the number of variables go to infinity. Our results establish that KGlasso has significantly faster asymptotic convergence than Glasso and FF. Simulations are presented that validate the results of our analysis."

1110.6497v1	This paper proposes a new randomized strategy for adaptive MCMC using Bayesian optimization. This approach applies to non-differentiable objective functions and trades off exploration and exploitation to reduce the number of potentially costly objective function evaluations. We demonstrate the strategy in the complex setting of sampling from constrained, discrete and densely connected probabilistic graphical models where, for each variation of the problem, one needs to adjust the parameters of the proposal mechanism automatically to ensure efficient mixing of the Markov chains.	Bayesian Optimization for Adaptive MCMC
1202.3704v1	We study learning in a noisy bisection model: specifically, Bayesian algorithms to learn a target value V given access only to noisy realizations of whether V is less than or greater than a threshold theta. At step t = 0, 1, 2, ..., the learner sets threshold theta t and observes a noisy realization of sign(V - theta t). After T steps, the goal is to output an estimate V^ which is within an eta-tolerance of V . This problem has been studied, predominantly in environments with a fixed error probability q < 1/2 for the noisy realization of sign(V - theta t). In practice, it is often the case that q can approach 1/2, especially as theta -> V, and there is little known when this happens. We give a pseudo-Bayesian algorithm which provably converges to V. When the true prior matches our algorithm's Gaussian prior, we show near-optimal expected performance. Our methods extend to the general multiple-threshold setting where the observation noisily indicates which of k >= 2 regions V belongs to.	Near-Optimal Target Learning With Stochastic Binary Signals
0811.4167v3	We propose a penalized orthogonal-components regression (POCRE) for large p small n data. Orthogonal components are sequentially constructed to maximize, upon standardization, their correlation to the response residuals. A new penalization framework, implemented via empirical Bayes thresholding, is presented to effectively identify sparse predictors of each component. POCRE is computationally efficient owing to its sequential construction of leading sparse principal components. In addition, such construction offers other properties such as grouping highly correlated predictors and allowing for collinear or nearly collinear predictors. With multivariate responses, POCRE can construct common components and thus build up latent-variable models for large p small n data.	Penalized Orthogonal-Components Regression for Large p Small n Data
1605.06359v3	We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. Popular methods rely on estimating a penalized maximum likelihood of the precision matrix. However, in these approaches structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term, the penalty can be difficult to adapt for domain-specific knowledge, and the inference is computationally demanding. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function, parametrized by a neural network that maps empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. Applying this framework, we find our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well: identifying relevant edges in both synthetic and real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain performance generally superior to analytical methods.	Learning to Discover Sparse Graphical Models
1708.09479v1	Graphical Lasso (GL) is a popular method for learning the structure of an undirected graphical model, which is based on an $l_1$ regularization technique. The first goal of this work is to study the behavior of the optimal solution of GL as a function of its regularization coefficient. We show that if the number of samples is not too small compared to the number of parameters, the sparsity pattern of the optimal solution of GL changes gradually when the regularization coefficient increases from 0 to infinity. The second objective of this paper is to compare the computationally-heavy GL technique with a numerically-cheap heuristic method for learning graphical models that is based on simply thresholding the sample correlation matrix. To this end, two notions of sign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices are developed, and then it is shown that the thresholding and GL methods are equivalent if: (i) the thresholded sample correlation matrix is both sign-consistent and inverse-consistent, and (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the smallest un-thresholded entries of the sample correlation matrix is not too small. By building upon this result, it is proved that the GL method--as a conic optimization problem--has an explicit closed-form solution if the thresholded sample correlation matrix has an acyclic structure. This result is then generalized to arbitrary sparse support graphs, where a formula is found to obtain an approximate solution of GL. The closed-form solution approximately satisfies the KKT conditions for the GL problem and, more importantly, the approximation error decreases exponentially fast with respect to the length of the minimum-length cycle of the sparsity graph. The developed results are demonstrated on synthetic data, electrical circuits, functional MRI data, and traffic flows for transportation networks.	Graphical Lasso and Thresholding: Equivalence and Closed-form Solutions
1502.01425v3	We propose a novel sparse tensor decomposition method, namely Tensor Truncated Power (TTP) method, that incorporates variable selection into the estimation of decomposition components. The sparsity is achieved via an efficient truncation step embedded in the tensor power iteration. Our method applies to a broad family of high dimensional latent variable models, including high dimensional Gaussian mixture and mixtures of sparse regressions. A thorough theoretical investigation is further conducted. In particular, we show that the final decomposition estimator is guaranteed to achieve a local statistical rate, and further strengthen it to the global statistical rate by introducing a proper initialization procedure. In high dimensional regimes, the obtained statistical rate significantly improves those shown in the existing non-sparse decomposition methods. The empirical advantages of TTP are confirmed in extensive simulated results and two real applications of click-through rate prediction and high-dimensional gene clustering.

1610.07262v2	Datasets containing large samples of time-to-event data arising from several small heterogeneous groups are commonly encountered in statistics. This presents problems as they cannot be pooled directly due to their heterogeneity or analyzed individually because of their small sample size. Bayesian nonparametric modelling approaches can be used to model such datasets given their ability to flexibly share information across groups. In this paper, we will compare three popular Bayesian nonparametric methods for modelling the survival functions of heterogeneous groups. Specifically, we will first compare the modelling accuracy of the Dirichlet process, the hierarchical Dirichlet process, and the nested Dirichlet process on simulated datasets of different sizes, where group survival curves differ in shape or in expectation. We, then, will compare the models on a real-world injury dataset.	Bayesian Nonparametric Modeling of Heterogeneous Groups of Censored Data
0901.3150v4	Let M be a random (alpha n) x n matrix of rank r<<n, and assume that a uniformly random subset E of its entries is observed. We describe an efficient algorithm that reconstructs M from |E| = O(rn) observed entries with relative root mean square error RMSE <= C(rn/|E|)^0.5 . Further, if r=O(1), M can be reconstructed exactly from |E| = O(n log(n)) entries. These results apply beyond random matrices to general low-rank incoherent matrices. This settles (in the case of bounded rank) a question left open by Candes and Recht and improves over the guarantees for their reconstruction algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm is O(|E|r log(n)), which opens the way to its use for massive data sets. In the process of proving these statements, we obtain a generalization of a celebrated result by Friedman-Kahn-Szemeredi and Feige-Ofek on the spectrum of sparse random matrices.

1608.04961v3	Datasets with a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes are routinely encountered in many application domains. In this work we examine an approach to clustering such datasets using homogeneity analysis. Homogeneity analysis determines a euclidean representation of the data. This can be analyzed by leveraging the large body of tools and techniques for data with a euclidean representation. Experiments conducted as part of this study suggest that this approach can be useful in the analysis and exploration of big datasets with a mixture of numerical and categorical attributes.

1610.08035v4	We propose a parallelizable sparse inverse formulation Gaussian process (SpInGP) for temporal models. It uses a sparse precision GP formulation and sparse matrix routines to speed up the computations. Due to the state-space formulation used in the algorithm, the time complexity of the basic SpInGP is linear, and because all the computations are parallelizable, the parallel form of the algorithm is sublinear in the number of data points. We provide example algorithms to implement the sparse matrix routines and experimentally test the method using both simulated and real data.

1111.1830v1	A main goal of regression is to derive statistical conclusions on the conditional distribution of the output variable Y given the input values x. Two of the most important characteristics of a single distribution are location and scale. Support vector machines (SVMs) are well established to estimate location functions like the conditional median or the conditional mean. We investigate the estimation of scale functions by SVMs when the conditional median is unknown, too. Estimation of scale functions is important e.g. to estimate the volatility in finance. We consider the median absolute deviation (MAD) and the interquantile range (IQR) as measures of scale. Our main result shows the consistency of MAD-type SVMs.	Estimation of scale functions to model heteroscedasticity by support  vector machines
1107.4340v1	In many areas of machine learning, it becomes necessary to find the eigenvector decompositions of large matrices. We discuss two methods for reducing the computational burden of spectral decompositions: the more venerable Nystom extension and a newly introduced algorithm based on random projections. Previous work has centered on the ability to reconstruct the original matrix. We argue that a more interesting and relevant comparison is their relative performance in clustering and classification tasks using the approximate eigenvectors as features. We demonstrate that performance is task specific and depends on the rank of the approximation.	Spectral approximations in machine learning
1411.1670v1	Variational inference algorithms have proven successful for Bayesian analysis in large data settings, with recent advances using stochastic variational inference (SVI). However, such methods have largely been studied in independent or exchangeable data settings. We develop an SVI algorithm to learn the parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs) in a time-dependent data setting. The challenge in applying stochastic optimization in this setting arises from dependencies in the chain, which must be broken to consider minibatches of observations. We propose an algorithm that harnesses the memory decay of the chain to adaptively bound errors arising from edge effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic experiments and a large genomics dataset where a batch algorithm is computationally infeasible.	Stochastic Variational Inference for Hidden Markov Models
1306.4103v1	We consider robust covariance estimation with group symmetry constraints. Non-Gaussian covariance estimation, e.g., Tyler scatter estimator and Multivariate Generalized Gaussian distribution methods, usually involve non-convex minimization problems. Recently, it was shown that the underlying principle behind their success is an extended form of convexity over the geodesics in the manifold of positive definite matrices. A modern approach to improve estimation accuracy is to exploit prior knowledge via additional constraints, e.g., restricting the attention to specific classes of covariances which adhere to prior symmetry structures. In this paper, we prove that such group symmetry constraints are also geodesically convex and can therefore be incorporated into various non-Gaussian covariance estimators. Practical examples of such sets include: circulant, persymmetric and complex/quaternion proper structures. We provide a simple numerical technique for finding maximum likelihood estimates under such constraints, and demonstrate their performance advantage using synthetic experiments.

1511.04408v1	We present a scalable Gaussian process model for identifying and characterizing smooth multidimensional changepoints, and automatically learning changes in expressive covariance structure. We use Random Kitchen Sink features to flexibly define a change surface in combination with expressive spectral mixture kernels to capture the complex statistical structure. Finally, through the use of novel methods for additive non-separable kernels, we can scale the model to large datasets. We demonstrate the model on numerical and real world data, including a large spatio-temporal disease dataset where we identify previously unknown heterogeneous changes in space and time.	Scalable Gaussian Processes for Characterizing Multidimensional Change  Surfaces
1406.1916v1	Nonparametric regression for massive numbers of samples (n) and features (p) is an increasingly important problem. In big n settings, a common strategy is to partition the feature space, and then separately apply simple models to each partition set. We propose an alternative approach, which avoids such partitioning and the associated sensitivity to neighborhood choice and distance metrics, by using random compression combined with Gaussian process regression. The proposed approach is particularly motivated by the setting in which the response is conditionally independent of the features given the projection to a low dimensional manifold. Conditionally on the random compression matrix and a smoothness parameter, the posterior distribution for the regression surface and posterior predictive distributions are available analytically. Running the analysis in parallel for many random compression matrices and smoothness parameters, model averaging is used to combine the results. The algorithm can be implemented rapidly even in very big n and p problems, has strong theoretical justification, and is found to yield state of the art predictive performance.	Compressed Gaussian Process
1510.01003v6	Hierarchical learning models, such as mixture models and Bayesian networks, are widely employed for unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering analysis. They consist of observable and hidden variables, which represent the given data and their hidden generation process, respectively. It has been pointed out that conventional statistical analysis is not applicable to these models, because redundancy of the latent variable produces singularities in the parameter space. In recent years, a method based on algebraic geometry has allowed us to analyze the accuracy of predicting observable variables when using Bayesian estimation. However, how to analyze latent variables has not been sufficiently studied, even though one of the main issues in unsupervised learning is to determine how accurately the latent variable is estimated. A previous study proposed a method that can be used when the range of the latent variable is redundant compared with the model generating data. The present paper extends that method to the situation in which the latent variables have redundant dimensions. We formulate new error functions and derive their asymptotic forms. Calculation of the error functions is demonstrated in two-layered Bayesian networks.	Bayesian Estimation of Multidimensional Latent Variables and Its  Asymptotic Accuracy
1502.07017v1	In this paper, we examine the problem of approximating a general linear dimensionality reduction (LDR) operator, represented as a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ with $m < n$, by a partial circulant matrix with rows related by circular shifts. Partial circulant matrices admit fast implementations via Fourier transform methods and subsampling operations; our investigation here is motivated by a desire to leverage these potential computational improvements in large-scale data processing tasks. We establish a fundamental result, that most large LDR matrices (whose row spaces are uniformly distributed) in fact cannot be well approximated by partial circulant matrices. Then, we propose a natural generalization of the partial circulant approximation framework that entails approximating the range space of a given LDR operator $A$ over a restricted domain of inputs, using a matrix formed as a product of a partial circulant matrix having $m '> m$ rows and a $m \times k$ 'post processing' matrix. We introduce a novel algorithmic technique, based on sparse matrix factorization, for identifying the factors comprising such approximations, and provide preliminary evidence to demonstrate the potential of this approach.

1106.5175v1	We study the problem of estimating from data, a sparse approximation to the inverse covariance matrix. Estimating a sparsity constrained inverse covariance matrix is a key component in Gaussian graphical model learning, but one that is numerically very challenging. We address this challenge by developing a new adaptive gradient-based method that carefully combines gradient information with an adaptive step-scaling strategy, which results in a scalable, highly competitive method. Our algorithm, like its predecessors, maximizes an $\ell_1$-norm penalized log-likelihood and has the same per iteration arithmetic complexity as the best methods in its class. Our experiments reveal that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art competitors, often significantly so, for large problems.	Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation via an Adaptive Gradient-Based  Method
1703.01056v5	Computing partition function is the most important statistical inference task arising in applications of Graphical Models (GM). Since it is computationally intractable, approximate methods have been used to resolve the issue in practice, where mean-field (MF) and belief propagation (BP) are arguably the most popular and successful approaches of a variational type. In this paper, we propose two new variational schemes, coined Gauged-MF (G-MF) and Gauged-BP (G-BP), improving MF and BP, respectively. Both provide lower bounds for the partition function by utilizing the so-called gauge transformation which modifies factors of GM while keeping the partition function invariant. Moreover, we prove that both G-MF and G-BP are exact for GMs with a single loop of a special structure, even though the bare MF and BP perform badly in this case. Our extensive experiments, on complete GMs of relatively small size and on large GM (up-to 300 variables) confirm that the newly proposed algorithms outperform and generalize MF and BP.

1306.0407v2	We introduce a general constructive setting of the density ratio estimation problem as a solution of a (multidimensional) integral equation. In this equation, not only its right hand side is known approximately, but also the integral operator is defined approximately. We show that this ill-posed problem has a rigorous solution and obtain the solution in a closed form. The key element of this solution is the novel V-matrix, which captures the geometry of the observed samples. We compare our method with three well-known previously proposed ones. Our experimental results demonstrate the good potential of the new approach.	Constructive Setting of the Density Ratio Estimation Problem and its  Rigorous Solution
0808.2241v1	We construct a framework for studying clustering algorithms, which includes two key ideas: persistence and functoriality. The first encodes the idea that the output of a clustering scheme should carry a multiresolution structure, the second the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme, stability and convergence are established.	Persistent Clustering and a Theorem of J. Kleinberg
1802.08429v1	Determinantal point processes (DPPs) enable the modelling of repulsion: they provide diverse sets of points. This repulsion is encoded in a kernel K that we can see as a matrix storing the similarity between points. The usual algorithm to sample DPPs is exact but it uses the spectral decomposition of K, a computation that becomes costly when dealing with a high number of points. Here, we present an alternative exact algorithm that avoids the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors computation and that is, for some applications, faster than the original algorithm.

1107.0662v1	This paper presents a Bayesian approach to symbol and phase inference in a phase-unsynchronized digital receiver. It primarily extends [Quinn 2011] to the multi-symbol case, using the variational Bayes (VB) approximation to deal with the combinatorial complexity of the phase inference in this case. The work provides a fully Bayesian extension of the EM-based framework underlying current turbo-synchronization methods, since it induces a von Mises prior on the time-invariant phase parmeter. As a result, we achieve tractable iterative algorithms with improved robustness in low SNR regimes, compared to the current EM-based approaches. As a corollary to our analysis we also discover the importance of prior regularization in elegantly tackling the significant problem of phase ambiguity.	A Variational Bayes Approach to Decoding in a Phase-Uncertain Digital  Receiver
1401.3358v1	In this survey, we present and compare different approaches to estimate Mutual Information (MI) from data to analyse general dependencies between variables of interest in a system. We demonstrate the performance difference of MI versus correlation analysis, which is only optimal in case of linear dependencies. First, we use a piece-wise constant Bayesian methodology using a general Dirichlet prior. In this estimation method, we use a two-stage approach where we approximate the probability distribution first and then calculate the marginal and joint entropies. Here, we demonstrate the performance of this Bayesian approach versus the others for computing the dependency between different variables. We also compare these with linear correlation analysis. Finally, we apply MI and correlation analysis to the identification of the bias in the determination of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) by the satellite based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the ground based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Here, we observe that the AOD measurements by these two instruments might be different for the same location. The reason of this bias is explored by quantifying the dependencies between the bias and 15 other variables including cloud cover, surface reflectivity and others.	Survey On The Estimation Of Mutual Information Methods as a Measure of  Dependency Versus Correlation Analysis
1512.00315v1	The understanding of the type of inhibitory interaction plays an important role in drug design. Therefore, researchers are interested to know whether a drug has competitive or non-competitive interaction to particular protein targets. Method: to analyze the interaction types we propose factorization method Macau which allows us to combine different measurement types into a single tensor together with proteins and compounds. The compounds are characterized by high dimensional 2D ECFP fingerprints. The novelty of the proposed method is that using a specially designed noise injection MCMC sampler it can incorporate high dimensional side information, i.e., millions of unique 2D ECFP compound features, even for large scale datasets of millions of compounds. Without the side information, in this case, the tensor factorization would be practically futile. Results: using public IC50 and Ki data from ChEMBL we trained a model from where we can identify the latent subspace separating the two measurement types (IC50 and Ki). The results suggest the proposed method can detect the competitive inhibitory activity between compounds and proteins.	Highly Scalable Tensor Factorization for Prediction of Drug-Protein  Interaction Type
1611.10349v1	In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-dimensional tensor regression problems with low-rank structure. One of the core challenges associated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the underlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations could lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On the other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In this paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees for learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank structural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied to a potentially non-convex constraint set $\Theta$ in terms of its \emph{localized Gaussian width}. We juxtapose our theoretical results for non-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on regularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and non-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the non-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has desirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical upper bound perspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of examples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which address these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and convex approaches. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that, under several common settings of generalized low rank tensor regression, the projected gradient descent approach is superior both in terms of statistical error and run-time provided the step-sizes of the projected descent algorithm are suitably chosen.	Non-Convex Projected Gradient Descent for Generalized Low-Rank Tensor  Regression
1706.09880v4	Interpreting gradient methods as fixed-point iterations, we provide a detailed analysis of those methods for minimizing convex objective functions. Due to their conceptual and algorithmic simplicity, gradient methods are widely used in machine learning for massive data sets (big data). In particular, stochastic gradient methods are considered the de- facto standard for training deep neural networks. Studying gradient methods within the realm of fixed-point theory provides us with powerful tools to analyze their convergence properties. In particular, gradient methods using inexact or noisy gradients, such as stochastic gradient descent, can be studied conveniently using well-known results on inexact fixed-point iterations. Moreover, as we demonstrate in this paper, the fixed-point approach allows an elegant derivation of accelerations for basic gradient methods. In particular, we will show how gradient descent can be accelerated by a fixed-point preserving transformation of an operator associated with the objective function.

1201.5338v2	Constrained clustering has been well-studied for algorithms such as $K$-means and hierarchical clustering. However, how to satisfy many constraints in these algorithmic settings has been shown to be intractable. One alternative to encode many constraints is to use spectral clustering, which remains a developing area. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for constrained spectral clustering. In contrast to some previous efforts that implicitly encode Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints by modifying the graph Laplacian or constraining the underlying eigenspace, we present a more natural and principled formulation, which explicitly encodes the constraints as part of a constrained optimization problem. Our method offers several practical advantages: it can encode the degree of belief in Must-Link and Cannot-Link constraints; it guarantees to lower-bound how well the given constraints are satisfied using a user-specified threshold; it can be solved deterministically in polynomial time through generalized eigendecomposition. Furthermore, by inheriting the objective function from spectral clustering and encoding the constraints explicitly, much of the existing analysis of unconstrained spectral clustering techniques remains valid for our formulation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by empirical results on both artificial and real datasets. We also demonstrate an innovative use of encoding large number of constraints: transfer learning via constraints.	On Constrained Spectral Clustering and Its Applications
1511.00831v1	"Dimensionality reduction methods are very common in the field of high dimensional data analysis. Typically, algorithms for dimensionality reduction are computationally expensive. Therefore, their applications for the analysis of massive amounts of data are impractical. For example, repeated computations due to accumulated data are computationally prohibitive. In this paper, an out-of-sample extension scheme, which is used as a complementary method for dimensionality reduction, is presented. We describe an algorithm which performs an out-of-sample extension to newly-arrived data points. Unlike other extension algorithms such as Nystr\""om algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses the intrinsic geometry of the data and properties for dimensionality reduction map. We prove that the error of the proposed algorithm is bounded. Additionally to the out-of-sample extension, the algorithm provides a degree of the abnormality of any newly-arrived data point."

1606.08957v1	We consider learning high-dimensional multi-response linear models with structured parameters. By exploiting the noise correlations among responses, we propose an alternating estimation (AltEst) procedure to estimate the model parameters based on the generalized Dantzig selector. Under suitable sample size and resampling assumptions, we show that the error of the estimates generated by AltEst, with high probability, converges linearly to certain minimum achievable level, which can be tersely expressed by a few geometric measures, such as Gaussian width of sets related to the parameter structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-asymptotic statistical guarantee for such AltEst-type algorithm applied to estimation problem with general structures.	Alternating Estimation for Structured High-Dimensional Multi-Response  Models
1105.2978v1	Kernel method is a very powerful tool in machine learning. The trick of kernel has been effectively and extensively applied in many areas of machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA). Kernel trick is to define a kernel function which relies on the inner-product of data in the feature space without knowing these feature space data. In this paper, the kernel trick will be employed to extend the algorithm of spectrum sensing with leading eigenvector under the framework of PCA to a higher dimensional feature space. Namely, the leading eigenvector of the sample covariance matrix in the feature space is used for spectrum sensing without knowing the leading eigenvector explicitly. Spectrum sensing with leading eigenvector under the framework of kernel PCA is proposed with the inner-product as a measure of similarity. A modified kernel GLRT algorithm based on matched subspace model will be the first time applied to spectrum sensing. The experimental results on simulated sinusoidal signal show that spectrum sensing with kernel PCA is about 4 dB better than PCA, besides, kernel GLRT is also better than GLRT. The proposed algorithms are also tested on the measured DTV signal. The simulation results show that kernel methods are 4 dB better than the corresponding linear methods. The leading eigenvector of the sample covariance matrix learned by kernel PCA is more stable than that learned by PCA for different segments of DTV signal.

1510.06299v1	We present GLASSES: Global optimisation with Look-Ahead through Stochastic Simulation and Expected-loss Search. The majority of global optimisation approaches in use are myopic, in only considering the impact of the next function value; the non-myopic approaches that do exist are able to consider only a handful of future evaluations. Our novel algorithm, GLASSES, permits the consideration of dozens of evaluations into the future. This is done by approximating the ideal look-ahead loss function, which is expensive to evaluate, by a cheaper alternative in which the future steps of the algorithm are simulated beforehand. An Expectation Propagation algorithm is used to compute the expected value of the loss.We show that the far-horizon planning thus enabled leads to substantive performance gains in empirical tests.

1205.5075v2	Sparse feature selection has been demonstrated to be effective in handling high-dimensional data. While promising, most of the existing works use convex methods, which may be suboptimal in terms of the accuracy of feature selection and parameter estimation. In this paper, we expand a nonconvex paradigm to sparse group feature selection, which is motivated by applications that require identifying the underlying group structure and performing feature selection simultaneously. The main contributions of this article are twofold: (1) statistically, we introduce a nonconvex sparse group feature selection model which can reconstruct the oracle estimator. Therefore, consistent feature selection and parameter estimation can be achieved; (2) computationally, we propose an efficient algorithm that is applicable to large-scale problems. Numerical results suggest that the proposed nonconvex method compares favorably against its competitors on synthetic data and real-world applications, thus achieving desired goal of delivering high performance.	Efficient Sparse Group Feature Selection via Nonconvex Optimization
1507.01661v1	The dictionary-aided sparse regression (SR) approach has recently emerged as a promising alternative to hyperspectral unmixing (HU) in remote sensing. By using an available spectral library as a dictionary, the SR approach identifies the underlying materials in a given hyperspectral image by selecting a small subset of spectral samples in the dictionary to represent the whole image. A drawback with the current SR developments is that an actual spectral signature in the scene is often assumed to have zero mismatch with its corresponding dictionary sample, and such an assumption is considered too ideal in practice. In this paper, we tackle the spectral signature mismatch problem by proposing a dictionary-adjusted nonconvex sparsity-encouraging regression (DANSER) framework. The main idea is to incorporate dictionary correcting variables in an SR formulation. A simple and low per-iteration complexity algorithm is tailor-designed for practical realization of DANSER. Using the same dictionary correcting idea, we also propose a robust subspace solution for dictionary pruning. Extensive simulations and real-data experiments show that the proposed method is effective in mitigating the undesirable spectral signature mismatch effects.

1508.04556v1	We are interested in solving the multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem for instances, where the underlying sparsity pattern exhibit spatio-temporal structure motivated by the electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization problem. We propose a probabilistic model that takes this structure into account by generalizing the structured spike and slab prior and the associated Expectation Propagation inference scheme. Based on numerical experiments, we demonstrate the viability of the model and the approximate inference scheme.	Spatio-temporal Spike and Slab Priors for Multiple Measurement Vector  Problems
1801.06230v1	The motivations for using variational inference (VI) in neural networks differ significantly from those in latent variable models. This has a counter-intuitive consequence; more expressive variational approximations can provide significantly worse predictions as compared to those with less expressive families. In this work we make two contributions. First, we identify a cause of this performance gap, variational over-pruning. Second, we introduce a theoretically grounded explanation for this phenomenon. Our perspective sheds light on several related published results and provides intuition into the design of effective variational approximations of neural networks.	Overpruning in Variational Bayesian Neural Networks
1204.3942v1	High-dimensional data common in genomics, proteomics, and chemometrics often contains complicated correlation structures. Recently, partial least squares (PLS) and Sparse PLS methods have gained attention in these areas as dimension reduction techniques in the context of supervised data analysis. We introduce a framework for Regularized PLS by solving a relaxation of the SIMPLS optimization problem with penalties on the PLS loadings vectors. Our approach enjoys many advantages including flexibility, general penalties, easy interpretation of results, and fast computation in high-dimensional settings. We also outline extensions of our methods leading to novel methods for Non-negative PLS and Generalized PLS, an adaption of PLS for structured data. We demonstrate the utility of our methods through simulations and a case study on proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data.

1602.07277v2	Consider the problem of sparse clustering, where it is assumed that only a subset of the features are useful for clustering purposes. In the framework of the COSA method of Friedman and Meulman, subsequently improved in the form of the Sparse K-means method of Witten and Tibshirani, a natural and simpler hill-climbing approach is introduced. The new method is shown to be competitive with these two methods and others.	A Simple Approach to Sparse Clustering
0906.4391v1	Selecting important features in non-linear or kernel spaces is a difficult challenge in both classification and regression problems. When many of the features are irrelevant, kernel methods such as the support vector machine and kernel ridge regression can sometimes perform poorly. We propose weighting the features within a kernel with a sparse set of weights that are estimated in conjunction with the original classification or regression problem. The iterative algorithm, KNIFE, alternates between finding the coefficients of the original problem and finding the feature weights through kernel linearization. In addition, a slight modification of KNIFE yields an efficient algorithm for finding feature regularization paths, or the paths of each feature's weight. Simulation results demonstrate the utility of KNIFE for both kernel regression and support vector machines with a variety of kernels. Feature path realizations also reveal important non-linear correlations among features that prove useful in determining a subset of significant variables. Results on vowel recognition data, Parkinson's disease data, and microarray data are also given.	KNIFE: Kernel Iterative Feature Extraction
1209.1996v1	We offer a novel view of AdaBoost in a statistical setting. We propose a Bayesian model for binary classification in which label noise is modeled hierarchically. Using variational inference to optimize a dynamic evidence lower bound, we derive a new boosting-like algorithm called VIBoost. We show its close connections to AdaBoost and give experimental results from four datasets.	A Bayesian Boosting Model
1003.0079v3	Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability and scalability. Unfortunately, this 1-norm MKL is rarely observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures, we generalize MKL to arbitrary norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efficient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary norms, like p-norms with p>1. Empirically, we demonstrate that the interleaved optimization strategies are much faster compared to the commonly used wrapper approaches. A theoretical analysis and an experiment on controlled artificial data experiment sheds light on the appropriateness of sparse, non-sparse and $\ell_\infty$-norm MKL in various scenarios. Empirical applications of p-norm MKL to three real-world problems from computational biology show that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that go beyond the state-of-the-art.

1401.3940v1	Tree structured graphical models are powerful at expressing long range or hierarchical dependency among many variables, and have been widely applied in different areas of computer science and statistics. However, existing methods for parameter estimation, inference, and structure learning mainly rely on the Gaussian or discrete assumptions, which are restrictive under many applications. In this paper, we propose new nonparametric methods based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space embeddings of distributions that can recover the latent tree structures, estimate the parameters, and perform inference for high dimensional continuous and non-Gaussian variables. The usefulness of the proposed methods are illustrated by thorough numerical results.	Nonparametric Latent Tree Graphical Models: Inference, Estimation, and  Structure Learning
1703.09631v1	"We consider a generalization of low-rank matrix completion to the case where the data belongs to an algebraic variety, i.e. each data point is a solution to a system of polynomial equations. In this case the original matrix is possibly high-rank, but it becomes low-rank after mapping each column to a higher dimensional space of monomial features. Many well-studied extensions of linear models, including affine subspaces and their union, can be described by a variety model. In addition, varieties can be used to model a richer class of nonlinear quadratic and higher degree curves and surfaces. We study the sampling requirements for matrix completion under a variety model with a focus on a union of affine subspaces. We also propose an efficient matrix completion algorithm that minimizes a convex or non-convex surrogate of the rank of the matrix of monomial features. Our algorithm uses the well-known ""kernel trick"" to avoid working directly with the high-dimensional monomial matrix. We show the proposed algorithm is able to recover synthetically generated data up to the predicted sampling complexity bounds. The proposed algorithm also outperforms standard low rank matrix completion and subspace clustering techniques in experiments with real data."	Algebraic Variety Models for High-Rank Matrix Completion
0812.0922v3	Probability Density Estimation (PDE) is a multivariate discrimination technique based on sampling signal and background densities defined by event samples from data or Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations in a multi-dimensional phase space. In this paper, we present a modification of the PDE method that uses a self-adapting binning method to divide the multi-dimensional phase space in a finite number of hyper-rectangles (cells). The binning algorithm adjusts the size and position of a predefined number of cells inside the multi-dimensional phase space, minimising the variance of the signal and background densities inside the cells. The implementation of the binning algorithm PDE-Foam is based on the MC event-generation package Foam. We present performance results for representative examples (toy models) and discuss the dependence of the obtained results on the choice of parameters. The new PDE-Foam shows improved classification capability for small training samples and reduced classification time compared to the original PDE method based on range searching.

1203.4597v1	"This paper proposes a new estimation algorithm for the parameters of an HMM as to best account for the observed data. In this model, in addition to the observation sequence, we have \emph{partial} and \emph{noisy} access to the hidden state sequence as side information. This access can be seen as ""partial labeling"" of the hidden states. Furthermore, we model possible mislabeling in the side information in a joint framework and derive the corresponding EM updates accordingly. In our simulations, we observe that using this side information, we considerably improve the state recognition performance, up to 70%, with respect to the ""achievable margin"" defined by the baseline algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm is shown to be robust to the training conditions."	A Novel Training Algorithm for HMMs with Partial and Noisy Access to the  States
1710.09768v1	Understanding and developing a correlation measure that can detect general dependencies is not only imperative to statistics and machine learning, but also crucial to general scientific discovery in the big data age. We proposed the Multiscale Generalized Correlation (MGC) in Shen et al. 2017 as a novel correlation measure, which worked well empirically and helped a number of real data discoveries. But there is a wide gap with respect to the theoretical side, e.g., the population statistic, the convergence from sample to population, how well does the algorithmic Sample MGC perform, etc. To better understand its underlying mechanism, in this paper we formalize the population version of local distance correlations, MGC, and the optimal local scale between the underlying random variables, by utilizing the characteristic functions and incorporating the nearest-neighbor machinery. The population version enables a seamless connection with, and significant improvement to, the algorithmic Sample MGC, both theoretically and in practice, which further allows a number of desirable asymptotic and finite-sample properties to be proved and explored for MGC. The advantages of MGC are further illustrated via a comprehensive set of simulations with linear, nonlinear, univariate, multivariate, and noisy dependencies, where it loses almost no power against monotone dependencies while achieving superior performance against general dependencies.	From Distance Correlation to Multiscale Generalized Correlation
1502.04631v2	Given a set of pairwise comparisons, the classical ranking problem computes a single ranking that best represents the preferences of all users. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring individual preferences, arising in the context of making personalized recommendations. In particular, we assume that there are $n$ users of $r$ types; users of the same type provide similar pairwise comparisons for $m$ items according to the Bradley-Terry model. We propose an efficient algorithm that accurately estimates the individual preferences for almost all users, if there are $r \max \{m, n\}\log m \log^2 n$ pairwise comparisons per type, which is near optimal in sample complexity when $r$ only grows logarithmically with $m$ or $n$. Our algorithm has three steps: first, for each user, compute the \emph{net-win} vector which is a projection of its $\binom{m}{2}$-dimensional vector of pairwise comparisons onto an $m$-dimensional linear subspace; second, cluster the users based on the net-win vectors; third, estimate a single preference for each cluster separately. The net-win vectors are much less noisy than the high dimensional vectors of pairwise comparisons and clustering is more accurate after the projection as confirmed by numerical experiments. Moreover, we show that, when a cluster is only approximately correct, the maximum likelihood estimation for the Bradley-Terry model is still close to the true preference.	Clustering and Inference From Pairwise Comparisons
1606.07840v1	We propose a probabilistic modeling framework for learning the dynamic patterns in the collective behaviors of social agents and developing profiles for different behavioral groups, using data collected from multiple information sources. The proposed model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian process, in which each observation is a finite mixture of an set of latent groups and the mixture proportions (i.e., group probabilities) are drawn randomly. Each group is associated with some distributions over a finite set of outcomes. Moreover, as time evolves, the structure of these groups also changes; we model the change in the group structure by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a fixed transition probability. We present an efficient inference method based on tensor decompositions and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation.	Modeling Group Dynamics Using Probabilistic Tensor Decompositions
1503.05684v1	Estimation of response functions is an important task in dynamic medical imaging. This task arises for example in dynamic renal scintigraphy, where impulse response or retention functions are estimated, or in functional magnetic resonance imaging where hemodynamic response functions are required. These functions can not be observed directly and their estimation is complicated because the recorded images are subject to superposition of underlying signals. Therefore, the response functions are estimated via blind source separation and deconvolution. Performance of this algorithm heavily depends on the used models of the response functions. Response functions in real image sequences are rather complicated and finding a suitable parametric form is problematic. In this paper, we study estimation of the response functions using non-parametric Bayesian priors. These priors were designed to favor desirable properties of the functions, such as sparsity or smoothness. These assumptions are used within hierarchical priors of the blind source separation and deconvolution algorithm. Comparison of the resulting algorithms with these priors is performed on synthetic dataset as well as on real datasets from dynamic renal scintigraphy. It is shown that flexible non-parametric priors improve estimation of response functions in both cases. MATLAB implementation of the resulting algorithms is freely available for download.

1401.8066v2	This paper presents a general vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) framework for the problem of learning an unknown functional dependency between a structured input space and a structured output space. Our formulation encompasses both Vector-valued Manifold Regularization and Co-regularized Multi-view Learning, providing in particular a unifying framework linking these two important learning approaches. In the case of the least square loss function, we provide a closed form solution, which is obtained by solving a system of linear equations. In the case of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, our formulation generalizes in particular both the binary Laplacian SVM to the multi-class, multi-view settings and the multi-class Simplex Cone SVM to the semi-supervised, multi-view settings. The solution is obtained by solving a single quadratic optimization problem, as in standard SVM, via the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) approach. Empirical results obtained on the task of object recognition, using several challenging datasets, demonstrate the competitiveness of our algorithms compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

1108.6094v1	"Ensemble methods for supervised machine learning have become popular due to their ability to accurately predict class labels with groups of simple, lightweight ""base learners."" While ensembles offer computationally efficient models that have good predictive capability they tend to be large and offer little insight into the patterns or structure in a dataset. We consider an ensemble technique that returns a model of ranked rules. The model accurately predicts class labels and has the advantage of indicating which parameter constraints are most useful for predicting those labels. An example of the rule ensemble method successfully ranking rules and selecting attributes is given with a dataset containing images of potential supernovas where the number of necessary features is reduced from 39 to 21. We also compare the rule ensemble method on a set of multi-class problems with boosting and bagging, which are two well known ensemble techniques that use decision trees as base learners, but do not have a rule ranking scheme."

1006.3972v1	Undirected graphical models encode in a graph $G$ the dependency structure of a random vector $Y$. In many applications, it is of interest to model $Y$ given another random vector $X$ as input. We refer to the problem of estimating the graph $G(x)$ of $Y$ conditioned on $X=x$ as ``graph-valued regression.'' In this paper, we propose a semiparametric method for estimating $G(x)$ that builds a tree on the $X$ space just as in CART (classification and regression trees), but at each leaf of the tree estimates a graph. We call the method ``Graph-optimized CART,'' or Go-CART. We study the theoretical properties of Go-CART using dyadic partitioning trees, establishing oracle inequalities on risk minimization and tree partition consistency. We also demonstrate the application of Go-CART to a meteorological dataset, showing how graph-valued regression can provide a useful tool for analyzing complex data.	Graph-Valued Regression

Instead of focussing on a single optimal parameter value we propose to treat parameters as dynamical quantities. We introduce an algorithm to generate complex dynamics for parameters and (both visible and hidden) state vectors.

1205.2640v1	We propose a method for inferring the existence of a latent common cause ('confounder') of two observed random variables. The method assumes that the two effects of the confounder are (possibly nonlinear) functions of the confounder plus independent, additive noise. We discuss under which conditions the model is identifiable (up to an arbitrary reparameterization of the confounder) from the joint distribution of the effects. We state and prove a theoretical result that provides evidence for the conjecture that the model is generically identifiable under suitable technical conditions. In addition, we propose a practical method to estimate the confounder from a finite i.i.d. sample of the effects and illustrate that the method works well on both simulated and real-world data.

1711.08392v1	We present an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for segmenting a multivariate non-stationary time series with structural breaks into stationary regions. We draw from recent work where the series is assumed to follow a vector autoregressive model within segments and a convex estimation procedure may be formulated using group fused lasso penalties. Our ADMM approach first splits the convex problem into a global quadratic program and a simple group lasso proximal update. We show that the global problem may be parallelized over rows of the time dependent transition matrices and furthermore that each subproblem may be rewritten in a form identical to the log-likelihood of a Gaussian state space model. Consequently, we develop a Kalman smoothing algorithm to solve the global update in time linear in the length of the series.

1112.2288v1	The asymptotic pseudo-trajectory approach to stochastic approximation of Benaim, Hofbauer and Sorin is extended for asynchronous stochastic approximations with a set-valued mean field. The asynchronicity of the process is incorporated into the mean field to produce convergence results which remain similar to those of an equivalent synchronous process. In addition, this allows many of the restrictive assumptions previously associated with asynchronous stochastic approximation to be removed. The framework is extended for a coupled asynchronous stochastic approximation process with set-valued mean fields. Two-timescales arguments are used here in a similar manner to the original work in this area by Borkar. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated through learning in a Markov decision process.	Asynchronous Stochastic Approximation with Differential Inclusions
1703.02628v3	"The goal of the paper is to design sequential strategies which lead to efficient optimization of an unknown function under the only assumption that it has a finite Lipschitz constant. We first identify sufficient conditions for the consistency of generic sequential algorithms and formulate the expected minimax rate for their performance. We introduce and analyze a first algorithm called LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO are proved, as well as fast rates under an additional H\""older like condition. An adaptive version of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown and has to be estimated along with the optimization. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown to hold for the adaptive LIPO algorithm and a numerical assessment is provided at the end of the paper to illustrate the potential of this strategy with respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical benchmark problems for global optimization."

1705.07131v2	Sparse pseudo-point approximations for Gaussian process (GP) models provide a suite of methods that support deployment of GPs in the large data regime and enable analytic intractabilities to be sidestepped. However, the field lacks a principled method to handle streaming data in which both the posterior distribution over function values and the hyperparameter estimates are updated in an online fashion. The small number of existing approaches either use suboptimal hand-crafted heuristics for hyperparameter learning, or suffer from catastrophic forgetting or slow updating when new data arrive. This paper develops a new principled framework for deploying Gaussian process probabilistic models in the streaming setting, providing methods for learning hyperparameters and optimising pseudo-input locations. The proposed framework is assessed using synthetic and real-world datasets.	Streaming Sparse Gaussian Process Approximations
1705.07152v1	Recently, (Blanchet, Kang, and Murhy 2016) showed that several machine learning algorithms, such as square-root Lasso, Support Vector Machines, and regularized logistic regression, among many others, can be represented exactly as distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems. The distributional uncertainty is defined as a neighborhood centered at the empirical distribution. We propose a methodology which learns such neighborhood in a natural data-driven way. We show rigorously that our framework encompasses adaptive regularization as a particular case. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that our proposed methodology is able to improve upon a wide range of popular machine learning estimators.

1611.07460v1	We present the Wright-Fisher Indian buffet process (WF-IBP), a probabilistic model for time-dependent data assumed to have been generated by an unknown number of latent features. This model is suitable as a prior in Bayesian nonparametric feature allocation models in which the features underlying the observed data exhibit a dependency structure over time. More specifically, we establish a new framework for generating dependent Indian buffet processes, where the Poisson random field model from population genetics is used as a way of constructing dependent beta processes. Inference in the model is complex, and we describe a sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for exact posterior simulation. We apply our construction to develop a nonparametric focused topic model for collections of time-stamped text documents and test it on the full corpus of NIPS papers published from 1987 to 2015.

1603.06846v2	We propose new metrics on sets, ontologies, and functions that can be used in various stages of probabilistic modeling, including exploratory data analysis, learning, inference, and result interpretation. These new functions unify and generalize some of the popular metrics on sets and functions, such as the Jaccard and bag distances on sets and Marczewski-Steinhaus distance on functions. We then introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic graphs drawn independently according to a fixed probability distribution and show how they can be used to calculate similarity between class labels for the objects with hierarchical output spaces (e.g., protein function). Finally, we provide evidence that the proposed metrics are useful by clustering species based solely on functional annotations available for subsets of their genes. The functional trees resemble evolutionary trees obtained by the phylogenetic analysis of their genomes.	New metrics for learning and inference on sets, ontologies, and  functions
1512.05219v1	When learning a hidden Markov model (HMM), sequen- tial observations can often be complemented by real-valued summary response variables generated from the path of hid- den states. Such settings arise in numerous domains, includ- ing many applications in biology, like motif discovery and genome annotation. In this paper, we present a flexible frame- work for jointly modeling both latent sequence features and the functional mapping that relates the summary response variables to the hidden state sequence. The algorithm is com- patible with a rich set of mapping functions. Results show that the availability of additional continuous response vari- ables can simultaneously improve the annotation of the se- quential observations and yield good prediction performance in both synthetic data and real-world datasets.

1705.07642v1	We study unsupervised generative modeling in terms of the optimal transport (OT) problem between true (but unknown) data distribution $P_X$ and the latent variable model distribution $P_G$. We show that the OT problem can be equivalently written in terms of probabilistic encoders, which are constrained to match the posterior and prior distributions over the latent space. When relaxed, this constrained optimization problem leads to a penalized optimal transport (POT) objective, which can be efficiently minimized using stochastic gradient descent by sampling from $P_X$ and $P_G$. We show that POT for the 2-Wasserstein distance coincides with the objective heuristically employed in adversarial auto-encoders (AAE) (Makhzani et al., 2016), which provides the first theoretical justification for AAEs known to the authors. We also compare POT to other popular techniques like variational auto-encoders (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2014). Our theoretical results include (a) a better understanding of the commonly observed blurriness of images generated by VAEs, and (b) establishing duality between Wasserstein GAN (Arjovsky and Bottou, 2017) and POT for the 1-Wasserstein distance.

0906.2034v1	We use convex relaxation techniques to provide a sequence of solutions to the matrix completion problem. Using the nuclear norm as a regularizer, we provide simple and very efficient algorithms for minimizing the reconstruction error subject to a bound on the nuclear norm. Our algorithm iteratively replaces the missing elements with those obtained from a thresholded SVD. With warm starts this allows us to efficiently compute an entire regularization path of solutions.

1106.1674v1	Stochastic Kronecker graphs supply a parsimonious model for large sparse real world graphs. They can specify the distribution of a large random graph using only three or four parameters. Those parameters have however proved difficult to choose in specific applications. This article looks at method of moments estimators that are computationally much simpler than maximum likelihood. The estimators are fast and in our examples, they typically yield Kronecker parameters with expected feature counts closer to a given graph than we get from KronFit. The improvement was especially prominent for the number of triangles in the graph.	Moment based estimation of stochastic Kronecker graph parameters
1409.0578v2	Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally expensive. Both the calculation of the acceptance probability and the creation of informed proposals usually require an iteration through the whole data set. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem by generating proposals which are only based on a subset of the data, by skipping the accept-reject step and by using decreasing step-sizes sequence $(\delta_m)_{m \geq 0}$. %Under appropriate Lyapunov conditions, We provide in this article a rigorous mathematical framework for analysing this algorithm. We prove that, under verifiable assumptions, the algorithm is consistent, satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) and its asymptotic bias-variance decomposition can be characterized by an explicit functional of the step-sizes sequence $(\delta_m)_{m \geq 0}$. We leverage this analysis to give practical recommendations for the notoriously difficult tuning of this algorithm: it is asymptotically optimal to use a step-size sequence of the type $\delta_m \asymp m^{-1/3}$, leading to an algorithm whose mean squared error (MSE) decreases at rate $\mathcal{O}(m^{-1/3})$	Consistency and fluctuations for stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
1501.06116v1	This paper introduces and develops a novel variable importance score function in the context of ensemble learning and demonstrates its appeal both theoretically and empirically. Our proposed score function is simple and more straightforward than its counterpart proposed in the context of random forest, and by avoiding permutations, it is by design computationally more efficient than the random forest variable importance function. Just like the random forest variable importance function, our score handles both regression and classification seamlessly. One of the distinct advantage of our proposed score is the fact that it offers a natural cut off at zero, with all the positive scores indicating importance and significance, while the negative scores are deemed indications of insignificance. An extra advantage of our proposed score lies in the fact it works very well beyond ensemble of trees and can seamlessly be used with any base learners in the random subspace learning context. Our examples, both simulated and real, demonstrate that our proposed score does compete mostly favorably with the random forest score.

1204.1664v3	Herding and kernel herding are deterministic methods of choosing samples which summarise a probability distribution. A related task is choosing samples for estimating integrals using Bayesian quadrature. We show that the criterion minimised when selecting samples in kernel herding is equivalent to the posterior variance in Bayesian quadrature. We then show that sequential Bayesian quadrature can be viewed as a weighted version of kernel herding which achieves performance superior to any other weighted herding method. We demonstrate empirically a rate of convergence faster than O(1/N). Our results also imply an upper bound on the empirical error of the Bayesian quadrature estimate.	Optimally-Weighted Herding is Bayesian Quadrature
1209.4120v2	Exact Gaussian Process (GP) regression has O(N^3) runtime for data size N, making it intractable for large N. Many algorithms for improving GP scaling approximate the covariance with lower rank matrices. Other work has exploited structure inherent in particular covariance functions, including GPs with implied Markov structure, and equispaced inputs (both enable O(N) runtime). However, these GP advances have not been extended to the multidimensional input setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional applications. This paper introduces and tests novel extensions of structured GPs to multidimensional inputs. We present new methods for additive GPs, showing a novel connection between the classic backfitting method and the Bayesian framework. To achieve optimal accuracy-complexity tradeoff, we extend this model with a novel variant of projection pursuit regression. Our primary result -- projection pursuit Gaussian Process Regression -- shows orders of magnitude speedup while preserving high accuracy. The natural second and third steps include non-Gaussian observations and higher dimensional equispaced grid methods. We introduce novel techniques to address both of these necessary directions. We thoroughly illustrate the power of these three advances on several datasets, achieving close performance to the naive Full GP at orders of magnitude less cost.

1605.07596v3	"We extend the traditional worst-case, minimax analysis of stochastic convex optimization by introducing a localized form of minimax complexity for individual functions. Our main result gives function-specific lower and upper bounds on the number of stochastic subgradient evaluations needed to optimize either the function or its ""hardest local alternative"" to a given numerical precision. The bounds are expressed in terms of a localized and computational analogue of the modulus of continuity that is central to statistical minimax analysis. We show how the computational modulus of continuity can be explicitly calculated in concrete cases, and relates to the curvature of the function at the optimum. We also prove a superefficiency result that demonstrates it is a meaningful benchmark, acting as a computational analogue of the Fisher information in statistical estimation. The nature and practical implications of the results are demonstrated in simulations."	Local Minimax Complexity of Stochastic Convex Optimization
1203.3496v1	We present a Dirichlet process mixture model over discrete incomplete rankings and study two Gibbs sampling inference techniques for estimating posterior clusterings. The first approach uses a slice sampling subcomponent for estimating cluster parameters. The second approach marginalizes out several cluster parameters by taking advantage of approximations to the conditional posteriors. We empirically demonstrate (1) the effectiveness of this approximation for improving convergence, (2) the benefits of the Dirichlet process model over alternative clustering techniques for ranked data, and (3) the applicability of the approach to exploring large realworld ranking datasets.

1702.05683v2	SAGA is a fast incremental gradient method on the finite sum problem and its effectiveness has been tested on a vast of applications. In this paper, we analyze SAGA on a class of non-strongly convex and non-convex statistical problem such as Lasso, group Lasso, Logistic regression with $\ell_1$ regularization, linear regression with SCAD regularization and Correct Lasso. We prove that SAGA enjoys the linear convergence rate up to the statistical estimation accuracy, under the assumption of restricted strong convexity (RSC). It significantly extends the applicability of SAGA in convex and non-convex optimization.	SAGA and Restricted Strong Convexity
1604.06036v1	We introduce sparse random projection, an important dimension-reduction tool from machine learning, for the estimation of discrete-choice models with high-dimensional choice sets. Initially, high-dimensional data are compressed into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space using random projections. Subsequently, estimation proceeds using cyclic monotonicity moment inequalities implied by the multinomial choice model; the estimation procedure is semi-parametric and does not require explicit distributional assumptions to be made regarding the random utility errors. The random projection procedure is justified via the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma -- the pairwise distances between data points are preserved during data compression, which we exploit to show convergence of our estimator. The estimator works well in simulations and in an application to a supermarket scanner dataset.	Random Projection Estimation of Discrete-Choice Models with Large Choice  Sets
1009.2009v1	Inspired by the hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMM), we present the hierarchical semi-Markov conditional random field (HSCRF), a generalisation of embedded undirectedMarkov chains tomodel complex hierarchical, nestedMarkov processes. It is parameterised in a discriminative framework and has polynomial time algorithms for learning and inference. Importantly, we consider partiallysupervised learning and propose algorithms for generalised partially-supervised learning and constrained inference. We demonstrate the HSCRF in two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking. We show that the HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases.

0806.4642v1	Art historians and archaeologists have long grappled with the regional classification of ancient Near Eastern ivory carvings. Based on the visual similarity of sculptures, individuals within these fields have proposed object assemblages linked to hypothesized regional production centers. Using quantitative rather than visual methods, we here approach this classification task by exploiting computational methods from machine learning currently used with success in a variety of statistical problems in science and engineering. We first construct a prediction function using 66 categorical features as inputs and regional style as output. The model assigns regional style group (RSG), with 98 percent prediction accuracy. We then rank these features by their mutual information with RSG, quantifying single-feature predictive power. Using the highest- ranking features in combination with nomographic visualization, we have found previously unknown relationships that may aid in the regional classification of these ivories and their interpretation in art historical context.	Predicting Regional Classification of Levantine Ivory Sculptures: A  Machine Learning Approach
0808.0780v1	The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the input. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and linear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional neighborhood representation.	LLE with low-dimensional neighborhood representation
1306.3574v1	The strategy of early stopping is a regularization technique based on choosing a stopping time for an iterative algorithm. Focusing on non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we analyze the early stopping strategy for a form of gradient-descent applied to the least-squares loss function. We propose a data-dependent stopping rule that does not involve hold-out or cross-validation data, and we prove upper bounds on the squared error of the resulting function estimate, measured in either the $L^2(P)$ and $L^2(P_n)$ norm. These upper bounds lead to minimax-optimal rates for various kernel classes, including Sobolev smoothness classes and other forms of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show through simulation that our stopping rule compares favorably to two other stopping rules, one based on hold-out data and the other based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate. We also establish a tight connection between our early stopping strategy and the solution path of a kernel ridge regression estimator.	Early stopping and non-parametric regression: An optimal data-dependent  stopping rule
1307.8333v1	In this project we further investigate the idea of reducing the dimensionality of datasets using a Borel isomorphism with the purpose of subsequently applying supervised learning algorithms, as originally suggested by my supervisor V. Pestov (in 2011 Dagstuhl preprint). Any consistent learning algorithm, for example kNN, retains universal consistency after a Borel isomorphism is applied. A series of concrete examples of Borel isomorphisms that reduce the number of dimensions in a dataset is provided, based on multiplying the data by orthogonal matrices before the dimensionality reducing Borel isomorphism is applied. We test the accuracy of the resulting classifier in a lower dimensional space with various data sets. Working with a phoneme voice recognition dataset, of dimension 256 with 5 classes (phonemes), we show that a Borel isomorphic reduction to dimension 16 leads to a minimal drop in accuracy. In conclusion, we discuss further prospects of the method.	Borel Isomorphic Dimensionality Reduction of Data and Supervised  Learning
1611.03979v1	We investigate if kernel regularization methods can achieve minimax convergence rates over a source condition regularity assumption for the target function. These questions have been considered in past literature, but only under specific assumptions about the decay, typically polynomial, of the spectrum of the the kernel mapping covariance operator. In the perspective of distribution-free results, we investigate this issue under much weaker assumption on the eigenvalue decay, allowing for more complex behavior that can reflect different structure of the data at different scales.	Kernel regression, minimax rates and effective dimensionality: beyond  the regular case
1203.3533v1	Separation of the sources and analysis of their connectivity have been an important topic in EEG/MEG analysis. To solve this problem in an automatic manner, we propose a two-layer model, in which the sources are conditionally uncorrelated from each other, but not independent; the dependence is caused by the causality in their time-varying variances (envelopes). The model is identified in two steps. We first propose a new source separation technique which takes into account the autocorrelations (which may be time-varying) and time-varying variances of the sources. The causality in the envelopes is then discovered by exploiting a special kind of multivariate GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity) model. The resulting causal diagram gives the effective connectivity between the separated sources; in our experimental results on MEG data, sources with similar functions are grouped together, with negative influences between groups, and the groups are connected via some interesting sources.

1302.7220v2	Gaussian process is a very promising novel technology that has been applied to both the regression problem and the classification problem. While for the regression problem it yields simple exact solutions, this is not the case for the classification problem, because we encounter intractable integrals. In this paper we develop a new derivation that transforms the problem into that of evaluating the ratio of multivariate Gaussian orthant integrals. Moreover, we develop a new Monte Carlo procedure that evaluates these integrals. It is based on some aspects of bootstrap sampling and acceptancerejection. The proposed approach has beneficial properties compared to the existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, such as simplicity, reliability, and speed.

1204.3573v2	We consider the problem of learning a set from random samples. We show how relevant geometric and topological properties of a set can be studied analytically using concepts from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. A new kind of reproducing kernel, that we call separating kernel, plays a crucial role in our study and is analyzed in detail. We prove a new analytic characterization of the support of a distribution, that naturally leads to a family of provably consistent regularized learning algorithms and we discuss the stability of these methods with respect to random sampling. Numerical experiments show that the approach is competitive, and often better, than other state of the art techniques.	Learning Sets with Separating Kernels
1501.00192v4	Recently theoretical guarantees have been obtained for matrix completion in the non-uniform sampling regime. In particular, if the sampling distribution aligns with the underlying matrix's leverage scores, then with high probability nuclear norm minimization will exactly recover the low rank matrix. In this article, we analyze the scenario in which the non-uniform sampling distribution may or may not not align with the underlying matrix's leverage scores. Here we explore learning the parameters for weighted nuclear norm minimization in terms of the empirical sampling distribution. We provide a sufficiency condition for these learned weights which provide an exact recovery guarantee for weighted nuclear norm minimization. It has been established that a specific choice of weights in terms of the true sampling distribution not only allows for weighted nuclear norm minimization to exactly recover the low rank matrix, but also allows for a quantifiable relaxation in the exact recovery conditions. In this article we extend this quantifiable relaxation in exact recovery conditions for a specific choice of weights defined analogously in terms of the empirical distribution as opposed to the true sampling distribution. To accomplish this we employ a concentration of measure bound and a large deviation bound. We also present numerical evidence for the healthy robustness of the weighted nuclear norm minimization algorithm to the choice of empirically learned weights. These numerical experiments show that for a variety of easily computable empirical weights, weighted nuclear norm minimization outperforms unweighted nuclear norm minimization in the non-uniform sampling regime.

1406.1546v1	For a density $f$ on ${\mathbb R}^d$, a {\it high-density cluster} is any connected component of $\{x: f(x) \geq \lambda\}$, for some $\lambda > 0$. The set of all high-density clusters forms a hierarchy called the {\it cluster tree} of $f$. We present two procedures for estimating the cluster tree given samples from $f$. The first is a robust variant of the single linkage algorithm for hierarchical clustering. The second is based on the $k$-nearest neighbor graph of the samples. We give finite-sample convergence rates for these algorithms which also imply consistency, and we derive lower bounds on the sample complexity of cluster tree estimation. Finally, we study a tree pruning procedure that guarantees, under milder conditions than usual, to remove clusters that are spurious while recovering those that are salient.	Consistent procedures for cluster tree estimation and pruning
1305.4153v1	We consider the problem of joint modelling of metabolic signals and gene expression in systems biology applications. We propose an approach based on input-output factorial hidden Markov models and propose a structured variational inference approach to infer the structure and states of the model. We start from the classical free form structured variational mean field approach and use a expectation propagation to approximate the expectations needed in the variational loop. We show that this corresponds to a factored expectation constrained approximate inference. We validate our model through extensive simulations and demonstrate its applicability on a real world bacterial data set.

1710.08165v1	We propose and analyze two new MCMC sampling algorithms, the Vaidya walk and the John walk, for generating samples from the uniform distribution over a polytope. Both random walks are sampling algorithms derived from interior point methods. The former is based on volumetric-logarithmic barrier introduced by Vaidya whereas the latter uses John's ellipsoids. We show that the Vaidya walk mixes in significantly fewer steps than the logarithmic-barrier based Dikin walk studied in past work. For a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by $n >d$ linear constraints, we show that the mixing time from a warm start is bounded as $\mathcal{O}(n^{0.5}d^{1.5})$, compared to the $\mathcal{O}(nd)$ mixing time bound for the Dikin walk. The cost of each step of the Vaidya walk is of the same order as the Dikin walk, and at most twice as large in terms of constant pre-factors. For the John walk, we prove an $\mathcal{O}(d^{2.5}\cdot\log^4(n/d))$ bound on its mixing time and conjecture that an improved variant of it could achieve a mixing time of $\mathcal{O}(d^2\cdot\text{polylog}(n/d))$. Additionally, we propose variants of the Vaidya and John walks that mix in polynomial time from a deterministic starting point. We illustrate the speed-up of the Vaidya walk over the Dikin walk via several numerical examples.	Fast MCMC sampling algorithms on polytopes
1412.8697v2	We propose a new class of semiparametric exponential family graphical models for the analysis of high dimensional mixed data. Different from the existing mixed graphical models, we allow the nodewise conditional distributions to be semiparametric generalized linear models with unspecified base measure functions. Thus, one advantage of our method is that it is unnecessary to specify the type of each node and the method is more convenient to apply in practice. Under the proposed model, we consider both problems of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing in high dimensions. In particular, we propose a symmetric pairwise score test for the presence of a single edge in the graph. Compared to the existing methods for hypothesis tests, our approach takes into account of the symmetry of the parameters, such that the inferential results are invariant with respect to the different parametrizations of the same edge. Thorough numerical simulations and a real data example are provided to back up our results.	On Semiparametric Exponential Family Graphical Models
1601.01190v3	This paper is about index policies for minimizing (frequentist) regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit model, inspired by a Bayesian view on the problem. Our main contribution is to prove that the Bayes-UCB algorithm, which relies on quantiles of posterior distributions, is asymptotically optimal when the reward distributions belong to a one-dimensional exponential family, for a large class of prior distributions. We also show that the Bayesian literature gives new insight on what kind of exploration rates could be used in frequentist, UCB-type algorithms. Indeed, approximations of the Bayesian optimal solution or the Finite Horizon Gittins indices provide a justification for the kl-UCB+ and kl-UCB-H+ algorithms, whose asymptotic optimality is also established.

1705.10388v1	Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have recently received increasing attention for their ability to provide well-calibrated posterior uncertainties. However, model selection---even choosing the number of nodes---remains an open question. In this work, we apply a horseshoe prior over node pre-activations of a Bayesian neural network, which effectively turns off nodes that do not help explain the data. We demonstrate that our prior prevents the BNN from under-fitting even when the number of nodes required is grossly over-estimated. Moreover, this model selection over the number of nodes doesn't come at the expense of predictive or computational performance; in fact, we learn smaller networks with comparable predictive performance to current approaches.

1710.00109v1	We consider the problem of reconstructing signals and images from periodic nonlinearities. For such problems, we design a measurement scheme that supports efficient reconstruction; moreover, our method can be adapted to extend to compressive sensing-based signal and image acquisition systems. Our techniques can be potentially useful for reducing the measurement complexity of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging systems, with little loss in reconstruction quality. Several numerical experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	Reconstruction from Periodic Nonlinearities, With Applications to HDR  Imaging
1802.04630v1	A simple framework Probabilistic Multi-view Graph Embedding (PMvGE) is proposed for multi-view feature learning with many-to-many associations. PMvGE is a probabilistic model for predicting new associations via graph embedding of the nodes of data vectors with links of their associations.Multi-view data vectors with many-to-many associations are transformed by neural networks to feature vectors in a shared space, and the probability of new association between two data vectors is modeled by the inner product of their feature vectors. While existing multi-view feature learning techniques can treat only either of many-to-many association or non-linear transformation, PMvGE can treat both simultaneously. By combining Mercer's theorem and the universal approximation theorem, we prove that PMvGE learns a wide class of similarity measures across views. PMvGE generalizes various existing multi-view methods such as Multiset Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA) and Cross-view Graph Embedding (CvGE). Our likelihood-based estimator enables efficient computation of non-linear transformations of data vectors in large-scale datasets by minibatch SGD. Numerical experiments illustrate that PMvGE outperforms existing multi-view methods.	A probabilistic framework for multi-view feature learning with  many-to-many associations via neural networks
1506.05666v2	The statistical dependencies which independent component analysis (ICA) cannot remove often provide rich information beyond the linear independent components. It would thus be very useful to estimate the dependency structure from data. While such models have been proposed, they usually concentrated on higher-order correlations such as energy (square) correlations. Yet, linear correlations are a most fundamental and informative form of dependency in many real data sets. Linear correlations are usually completely removed by ICA and related methods, so they can only be analyzed by developing new methods which explicitly allow for linearly correlated components. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model of linear non-Gaussian components which are allowed to have both linear and energy correlations. The precision matrix of the linear components is assumed to be randomly generated by a higher-order process and explicitly parametrized by a parameter matrix. The estimation of the parameter matrix is shown to be particularly simple because using score matching, the objective function is a quadratic form. Using simulations with artificial data, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves identifiability of non-Gaussian components by simultaneously learning their correlation structure. Applications on simulated complex cells with natural image input, as well as spectrograms of natural audio data show that the method finds new kinds of dependencies between the components.	Simultaneous Estimation of Non-Gaussian Components and their Correlation  Structure
1502.07334v5	We consider the problem of multivariate regression in a setting where the relevant predictors could be shared among different responses. We propose an algorithm which decomposes the coefficient matrix into the product of a long matrix and a wide matrix, with an elastic net penalty on the former and an $\ell_1$ penalty on the latter. The first matrix linearly transforms the predictors to a set of latent factors, and the second one regresses the responses on these factors. Our algorithm simultaneously performs dimension reduction and coefficient estimation and automatically estimates the number of latent factors from the data. Our formulation results in a non-convex optimization problem, which despite its flexibility to impose effective low-dimensional structure, is difficult, or even impossible, to solve exactly in a reasonable time. We specify an optimization algorithm based on alternating minimization with three different sets of updates to solve this non-convex problem and provide theoretical results on its convergence and optimality. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via experiments on simulated and real data.	Sparse Multivariate Factor Regression
1102.3923v2	We consider the problem of approximately reconstructing a partially-observed, approximately low-rank matrix. This problem has received much attention lately, mostly using the trace-norm as a surrogate to the rank. Here we study low-rank matrix reconstruction using both the trace-norm, as well as the less-studied max-norm, and present reconstruction guarantees based on existing analysis on the Rademacher complexity of the unit balls of these norms. We show how these are superior in several ways to recently published guarantees based on specialized analysis.	Concentration-Based Guarantees for Low-Rank Matrix Reconstruction
1706.04632v1	Stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) algorithms have proven useful in scaling Bayesian inference to large datasets under an assumption of i.i.d data. We instead develop an SG-MCMC algorithm to learn the parameters of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for time-dependent data. There are two challenges to applying SG-MCMC in this setting: The latent discrete states, and needing to break dependencies when considering minibatches. We consider a marginal likelihood representation of the HMM and propose an algorithm that harnesses the inherent memory decay of the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic experiments and an ion channel recording data, with runtimes significantly outperforming batch MCMC.

1103.0790v1	We derive an upper bound on the local Rademacher complexity of $\ell_p$-norm multiple kernel learning, which yields a tighter excess risk bound than global approaches. Previous local approaches aimed at analyzed the case $p=1$ only while our analysis covers all cases $1\leq p\leq\infty$, assuming the different feature mappings corresponding to the different kernels to be uncorrelated. We also show a lower bound that shows that the bound is tight, and derive consequences regarding excess loss, namely fast convergence rates of the order $O(n^{-\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}})$, where $\alpha$ is the minimum eigenvalue decay rate of the individual kernels.

1711.05150v1	Network clustering reveals the organization of a network or corresponding complex system with elements represented as vertices and interactions as edges in a (directed, weighted) graph. Although the notion of clustering can be somewhat loose, network clusters or groups are generally considered as nodes with enriched interactions and edges sharing common patterns. Statistical inference often treats groups as latent variables, with observed networks generated from latent group structure, termed a stochastic block model. Regardless of the definitions, statistical inference can be either translated to modularity maximization, which is provably an NP-complete problem. Here we present scalable and reliable algorithms that recover hierarchical stochastic block models fast and accurately. Our algorithm scales almost linearly in number of edges, and inferred models were more accurate that other scalable methods.

1005.0188v1	We introduce two kernels that extend the mean map, which embeds probability measures in Hilbert spaces. The generative mean map kernel (GMMK) is a smooth similarity measure between probabilistic models. The latent mean map kernel (LMMK) generalizes the non-iid formulation of Hilbert space embeddings of empirical distributions in order to incorporate latent variable models. When comparing certain classes of distributions, the GMMK exhibits beneficial regularization and generalization properties not shown for previous generative kernels. We present experiments comparing support vector machine performance using the GMMK and LMMK between hidden Markov models to the performance of other methods on discrete and continuous observation sequence data. The results suggest that, in many cases, the GMMK has generalization error competitive with or better than other methods.	Generative and Latent Mean Map Kernels
1703.02674v3	"We study dual volume sampling, a method for selecting k columns from an n x m short and wide matrix (n <= k <= m) such that the probability of selection is proportional to the volume spanned by the rows of the induced submatrix. This method was proposed by Avron and Boutsidis (2013), who showed it to be a promising method for column subset selection and its multiple applications. However, its wider adoption has been hampered by the lack of polynomial time sampling algorithms. We remove this hindrance by developing an exact (randomized) polynomial time sampling algorithm as well as its derandomization. Thereafter, we study dual volume sampling via the theory of real stable polynomials and prove that its distribution satisfies the ""Strong Rayleigh"" property. This result has numerous consequences, including a provably fast-mixing Markov chain sampler that makes dual volume sampling much more attractive to practitioners. This sampler is closely related to classical algorithms for popular experimental design methods that are to date lacking theoretical analysis but are known to empirically work well."

1609.05148v4	"Determining whether certain properties are related to other properties is fundamental to scientific discovery. As data collection rates accelerate, it is becoming increasingly difficult yet ever more important to determine whether one property of data (e.g., cloud density) is related to another (e.g., grass wetness). Only if two properties are related are further investigations into the geometry of the relationship warranted. While existing approaches can test whether two properties are related, they may require unfeasibly large sample sizes in real data scenarios, and do not provide insight into the geometry underlying the structure of the relationship. We juxtapose hypothesis testing, manifold learning, and harmonic analysis to obtain Multiscale Generalized Correlation (MGC). Our key insight is that one can adaptively restrict the analysis to the ""jointly local"" observations - that is, one can estimate the scale with the most informative neighbors for determining the existence and geometry of a relationship. We prove that to achieve a given true positive rate, MGC typically requires far fewer samples than existing methods for all investigated dependence structures and dimensionalities, while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, MGC uniquely provides a simple and elegant characterization of the potentially complex latent geometry underlying the relationship. We used MGC to detect the presence and reveal the geometry of the relationships between mental and brain properties, to perform a proteomics screening, and to develop an imaging biomarker for disease, while avoiding the false positive inflation problems that have plagued conventional parametric approaches. Our open source implementation of MGC is easy to use, parameter-free, and applicable to previously vexing statistical questions that are ubiquitous in science, government, finance, and other disciplines."	Discovering Relationships and their Structures Across Disparate Data  Modalities
1412.1370v1	Deep Gaussian processes provide a flexible approach to probabilistic modelling of data using either supervised or unsupervised learning. For tractable inference approximations to the marginal likelihood of the model must be made. The original approach to approximate inference in these models used variational compression to allow for approximate variational marginalization of the hidden variables leading to a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model [Damianou and Lawrence, 2013]. In this paper we extend this idea with a nested variational compression. The resulting lower bound on the likelihood can be easily parallelized or adapted for stochastic variational inference.	Nested Variational Compression in Deep Gaussian Processes
1406.0873v2	Linear dimensionality reduction methods are a cornerstone of analyzing high dimensional data, due to their simple geometric interpretations and typically attractive computational properties. These methods capture many data features of interest, such as covariance, dynamical structure, correlation between data sets, input-output relationships, and margin between data classes. Methods have been developed with a variety of names and motivations in many fields, and perhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been highlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as optimization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component analysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, canonical correlations analysis, maximum autocorrelation factors, slow feature analysis, sufficient dimensionality reduction, undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output, an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization framework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an orthogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis. More broadly, this survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology.

1610.08928v1	Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a popular tool for data exploration. Bayesian NMF promises to also characterize uncertainty in the factorization. Unfortunately, current inference approaches such as MCMC mix slowly and tend to get stuck on single modes. We introduce a novel approach using rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) to asymptotically cover regions of high posterior density. These are placed in a principled Bayesian framework via an online extension to nonparametric variational inference. On experiments on real and synthetic data, we obtain greater coverage of the posterior and higher ELBO values than standard NMF inference approaches.	Rapid Posterior Exploration in Bayesian Non-negative Matrix  Factorization
1606.00906v2	We introduce the truncated Gaussian graphical model (TGGM) as a novel framework for designing statistical models for nonlinear learning. A TGGM is a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) with a subset of variables truncated to be nonnegative. The truncated variables are assumed latent and integrated out to induce a marginal model. We show that the variables in the marginal model are non-Gaussian distributed and their expected relations are nonlinear. We use expectation-maximization to break the inference of the nonlinear model into a sequence of TGGM inference problems, each of which is efficiently solved by using the properties and numerical methods of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We use the TGGM to design models for nonlinear regression and classification, with the performances of these models demonstrated on extensive benchmark datasets and compared to state-of-the-art competing results.	Nonlinear Statistical Learning with Truncated Gaussian Graphical Models
1610.03113v2	We derive a novel variational expectation maximization approach based on truncated variational distributions. Truncated distributions are proportional to exact posteriors within a subset of a discrete state space and equal zero otherwise. The novel variational approach is realized by first generalizing the standard variational EM framework to include variational distributions with exact (`hard') zeros. A fully variational treatment of truncated distributions then allows for deriving novel and mathematically grounded results, which in turn can be used to formulate novel efficient algorithms to optimize the parameters of probabilistic generative models. We find the free energies which correspond to truncated distributions to be given by concise and efficiently computable expressions, while update equations for model parameters (M-steps) remain in their standard form. Furthermore, we obtain generic expressions for expectation values w.r.t. truncated distributions. Based on these observations, we show how efficient and easily applicable meta-algorithms can be formulated that guarantee a monotonic increase of the free energy. Example applications of the here derived framework provide novel theoretical results and learning procedures for latent variable models as well as mixture models including procedures to tightly couple sampling and variational optimization approaches. Furthermore, by considering a special case of truncated variational distributions, we can cleanly and fully embed the well-known `hard EM' approaches into the variational EM framework, and we show that `hard EM' (for models with discrete latents) provably optimizes a lower free energy bound of the data log-likelihood.	Truncated Variational Expectation Maximization
1711.10927v1	Stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) has been increasingly popular in Bayesian learning due to its ability to deal with large data. A standard SG-MCMC algorithm simulates samples from a discretized-time Markov chain to approximate a target distribution. However, the samples are typically highly correlated due to the sequential generation process, an undesired property in SG-MCMC. In contrary, Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) directly optimizes a set of particles, and it is able to approximate a target distribution with much fewer samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method to directly optimize particles (or samples) in SG-MCMC from scratch. Specifically, we propose efficient methods to solve the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation on the space of probability distributions, whose solution (i.e., a distribution) is approximated by particles. Through our framework, we are able to show connections of SG-MCMC to SVGD, as well as the seemly unrelated generative-adversarial-net framework. Under certain relaxations, particle optimization in SG-MCMC can be interpreted as an extension of standard SVGD with momentum.	Particle Optimization in Stochastic Gradient MCMC
1111.0559v1	Structure learning in random fields has attracted considerable attention due to its difficulty and importance in areas such as remote sensing, computational biology, natural language processing, protein networks, and social network analysis. We consider the problem of estimating the probabilistic graph structure associated with a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF), the Ising model and the Potts model, by extending previous work on $l_1$ regularized neighborhood estimation to include the elastic net $l_1+l_2$ penalty. Additionally, we show numerical evidence that the edge density plays a role in the graph recovery process. Finally, we introduce a novel method for augmenting neighborhood estimation by leveraging pair-wise neighborhood union estimates.	Model Selection in Undirected Graphical Models with the Elastic Net
1006.5051v1	Abc-boost is a new line of boosting algorithms for multi-class classification, by utilizing the commonly used sum-to-zero constraint. To implement abc-boost, a base class must be identified at each boosting step. Prior studies used a very expensive procedure based on exhaustive search for determining the base class at each boosting step. Good testing performances of abc-boost (implemented as abc-mart and abc-logitboost) on a variety of datasets were reported. For large datasets, however, the exhaustive search strategy adopted in prior abc-boost algorithms can be too prohibitive. To overcome this serious limitation, this paper suggests a heuristic by introducing Gaps when computing the base class during training. That is, we update the choice of the base class only for every $G$ boosting steps (i.e., G=1 in prior studies). We test this idea on large datasets (Covertype and Poker) as well as datasets of moderate sizes. Our preliminary results are very encouraging. On the large datasets, even with G=100 (or larger), there is essentially no loss of test accuracy. On the moderate datasets, no obvious loss of test accuracy is observed when G<= 20~50. Therefore, aided by this heuristic, it is promising that abc-boost will be a practical tool for accurate multi-class classification.	Fast ABC-Boost for Multi-Class Classification
1506.07959v1	Factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs) are powerful tools of modeling sequential data. Learning FHMMs yields a challenging simultaneous model selection issue, i.e., selecting the number of multiple Markov chains and the dimensionality of each chain. Our main contribution is to address this model selection issue by extending Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference to FHMMs. First, we offer a better approximation of marginal log-likelihood than the previous FAB inference. Our key idea is to integrate out transition probabilities, yet still apply the Laplace approximation to emission probabilities. Second, we prove that if there are two very similar hidden states in an FHMM, i.e. one is redundant, then FAB will almost surely shrink and eliminate one of them, making the model parsimonious. Experimental results show that FAB for FHMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art nonparametric Bayesian iFHMM and Variational FHMM in model selection accuracy, with competitive held-out perplexity.

1101.0673v1	We propose in this work a new family of kernels for variable-length time series. Our work builds upon the vector autoregressive (VAR) model for multivariate stochastic processes: given a multivariate time series x, we consider the likelihood function p_{\theta}(x) of different parameters \theta in the VAR model as features to describe x. To compare two time series x and x', we form the product of their features p_{\theta}(x) p_{\theta}(x') which is integrated out w.r.t \theta using a matrix normal-inverse Wishart prior. Among other properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of the time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x and x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary state spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel \kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram matrices produced by \kappa on observations and subsequences of observations enumerated in x and x'. We describe a computationally efficient implementation of this generalization that uses low-rank matrix factorization techniques. These kernels are compared to other known kernels using a set of benchmark classification tasks carried out with support vector machines.	Autoregressive Kernels For Time Series
1302.2068v1	It has been shown that AIC-type criteria are asymptotically efficient selectors of the tuning parameter in non-concave penalized regression methods under the assumption that the population variance is known or that a consistent estimator is available. We relax this assumption to prove that AIC itself is asymptotically efficient and we study its performance in finite samples. In classical regression, it is known that AIC tends to select overly complex models when the dimension of the maximum candidate model is large relative to the sample size. Simulation studies suggest that AIC suffers from the same shortcomings when used in penalized regression. We therefore propose the use of the classical corrected AIC (AICc) as an alternative and prove that it maintains the desired asymptotic properties. To broaden our results, we further prove the efficiency of AIC for penalized likelihood methods in the context of generalized linear models with no dispersion parameter. Similar results exist in the literature but only for a restricted set of candidate models. By employing results from the classical literature on maximum-likelihood estimation in misspecified models, we are able to establish this result for a general set of candidate models. We use simulations to assess the performance of AIC and AICc, as well as that of other selectors, in finite samples for both SCAD-penalized and Lasso regressions and a real data example is considered.	Efficiency for Regularization Parameter Selection in Penalized  Likelihood Estimation of Misspecified Models
1301.2007v1	We propose a spectral clustering method based on local principal components analysis (PCA). After performing local PCA in selected neighborhoods, the algorithm builds a nearest neighbor graph weighted according to a discrepancy between the principal subspaces in the neighborhoods, and then applies spectral clustering. As opposed to standard spectral methods based solely on pairwise distances between points, our algorithm is able to resolve intersections. We establish theoretical guarantees for simpler variants within a prototypical mathematical framework for multi-manifold clustering, and evaluate our algorithm on various simulated data sets.

1801.08454v1	"The need to reason about uncertainty in large, complex, and multi-modal datasets has become increasingly common across modern scientific environments. The ability to transform samples from one distribution $P$ to another distribution $Q$ enables the solution to many problems in machine learning (e.g. Bayesian inference, generative modeling) and has been actively pursued from theoretical, computational, and application perspectives across the fields of information theory, computer science, and biology. Performing such transformations , in general, still comprises computational difficulties, especially in high dimensions. Here, we consider the problem of computing such ""measure transport maps"" with efficient and parallelizable methods. Under the mild assumptions that $P$ need not be known but can be sampled from, that the density of $Q$ is known up to a proportionality constant, and that $Q$ is log-concave, we provide a convex optimization problem pertaining to relative entropy minimization. We show how an empirical minimization formulation and polynomial chaos map parameterization can allow for learning a transport map between $P$ and $Q$ with distributed and scalable methods. We also leverage findings from nonequilibrium thermodynamics to represent the transport map as a composition of simpler maps, each of which is learned sequentially with a transport cost regularized version of the aforementioned problem formulation. We provide examples of our framework within the context of Bayesian inference for the Boston housing dataset, active learning for optimizing human computer interfaces, density estimation for probabilistic sleep staging with EEG, and generative modeling for handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset."

0802.2906v2	Dimensionality reduction is a topic of recent interest. In this paper, we present the classification constrained dimensionality reduction (CCDR) algorithm to account for label information. The algorithm can account for multiple classes as well as the semi-supervised setting. We present an out-of-sample expressions for both labeled and unlabeled data. For unlabeled data, we introduce a method of embedding a new point as preprocessing to a classifier. For labeled data, we introduce a method that improves the embedding during the training phase using the out-of-sample extension. We investigate classification performance using the CCDR algorithm on hyper-spectral satellite imagery data. We demonstrate the performance gain for both local and global classifiers and demonstrate a 10% improvement of the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm performance. We present a connection between intrinsic dimension estimation and the optimal embedding dimension obtained using the CCDR algorithm.	Classification Constrained Dimensionality Reduction
1604.01351v2	Nonparametric detection of existence of an anomalous structure over a network is investigated. Nodes corresponding to the anomalous structure (if one exists) receive samples generated by a distribution q, which is different from a distribution p generating samples for other nodes. If an anomalous structure does not exist, all nodes receive samples generated by p. It is assumed that the distributions p and q are arbitrary and unknown. The goal is to design statistically consistent tests with probability of errors converging to zero as the network size becomes asymptotically large. Kernel-based tests are proposed based on maximum mean discrepancy that measures the distance between mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Detection of an anomalous interval over a line network is first studied. Sufficient conditions on minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals are characterized in order to guarantee the proposed test to be consistent. It is also shown that certain necessary conditions must hold to guarantee any test to be universally consistent. Comparison of sufficient and necessary conditions yields that the proposed test is order-level optimal and nearly optimal respectively in terms of minimum and maximum sizes of candidate anomalous intervals. Generalization of the results to other networks is further developed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed tests.

1802.05550v1	Independent Component Analysis (ICA) - one of the basic tools in data analysis - aims to find a coordinate system in which the components of the data are independent. Most popular ICA methods use kurtosis as a metric of non-Gaussianity to maximize, such as FastICA and JADE. However, their assumption of fourth-order moment (kurtosis) may not always be satisfied in practice. One of the possible solution is to use third-order moment (skewness) instead of kurtosis, which was applied in $ICA_{SG}$ and EcoICA. In this paper we present a competitive approach to ICA based on the Split Generalized Gaussian distribution (SGGD), which is well adapted to heavy-tailed as well as asymmetric data. Consequently, we obtain a method which works better than the classical approaches, in both cases: heavy tails and non-symmetric data. \end{abstract}	ICA based on Split Generalized Gaussian
1201.3302v2	This paper develops a general theoretical framework to analyze structured sparse recovery problems using the notation of dual certificate. Although certain aspects of the dual certificate idea have already been used in some previous work, due to the lack of a general and coherent theory, the analysis has so far only been carried out in limited scopes for specific problems. In this context the current paper makes two contributions. First, we introduce a general definition of dual certificate, which we then use to develop a unified theory of sparse recovery analysis for convex programming. Second, we present a class of structured sparsity regularization called structured Lasso for which calculations can be readily performed under our theoretical framework. This new theory includes many seemingly loosely related previous work as special cases; it also implies new results that improve existing ones even for standard formulations such as L1 regularization.

0804.4685v4	Gaussian processes retain the linear model either as a special case, or in the limit. We show how this relationship can be exploited when the data are at least partially linear. However from the perspective of the Bayesian posterior, the Gaussian processes which encode the linear model either have probability of nearly zero or are otherwise unattainable without the explicit construction of a prior with the limiting linear model in mind. We develop such a prior, and show that its practical benefits extend well beyond the computational and conceptual simplicity of the linear model. For example, linearity can be extracted on a per-dimension basis, or can be combined with treed partition models to yield a highly efficient nonstationary model. Our approach is demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets of varying linearity and dimensionality.	Gaussian Processes and Limiting Linear Models
1006.1343v1	The Lady Maisry ballads afford us a framework within which to segment a storyline into its major components. Segments and as a consequence nodal points are discussed for nine different variants of the Lady Maisry story of a (young) woman being burnt to death by her family, on account of her becoming pregnant by a foreign personage. We motivate the importance of nodal points in textual and literary analysis. We show too how the openings of the nine variants can be analyzed comparatively, and also the conclusions of the ballads.

1511.07421v1	"State-of-the-art speaker recognition relays on models that need a large amount of training data. This models are successful in tasks like NIST SRE because there is sufficient data available. However, in real applications, we usually do not have so much data and, in many cases, the speaker labels are unknown. We present a method to adapt a PLDA model from a domain with a large amount of labeled data to another with unlabeled data. We describe a generative model that produces both sets of data where the unknown labels are modeled like latent variables. We used variational Bayes to estimate the hidden variables. Here, we derive the equations for this model. This model has been used in the papers: ""UNSUPERVISED ADAPTATION OF PLDA BY USING VARIATIONAL BAYES METHODS"" publised at ICASSP 2014, ""Unsupervised Training of PLDA with Variational Bayes"" published at Iberspeech 2014, and ""VARIATIONAL BAYESIAN PLDA FOR SPEAKER DIARIZATION IN THE MGB CHALLENGE"" published at ASRU 2015."

1506.03208v1	Corrupting the input and hidden layers of deep neural networks (DNNs) with multiplicative noise, often drawn from the Bernoulli distribution (or 'dropout'), provides regularization that has significantly contributed to deep learning's success. However, understanding how multiplicative corruptions prevent overfitting has been difficult due to the complexity of a DNN's functional form. In this paper, we show that when a Gaussian prior is placed on a DNN's weights, applying multiplicative noise induces a Gaussian scale mixture, which can be reparameterized to circumvent the problematic likelihood function. Analysis can then proceed by using a type-II maximum likelihood procedure to derive a closed-form expression revealing how regularization evolves as a function of the network's weights. Results show that multiplicative noise forces weights to become either sparse or invariant to rescaling. We find our analysis has implications for model compression as it naturally reveals a weight pruning rule that starkly contrasts with the commonly used signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While the SNR prunes weights with large variances, seeing them as noisy, our approach recognizes their robustness and retains them. We empirically demonstrate our approach has a strong advantage over the SNR heuristic and is competitive to retraining with soft targets produced from a teacher model.

1203.3517v1	Relational learning can be used to augment one data source with other correlated sources of information, to improve predictive accuracy. We frame a large class of relational learning problems as matrix factorization problems, and propose a hierarchical Bayesian model. Training our Bayesian model using random-walk Metropolis-Hastings is impractically slow, and so we develop a block Metropolis-Hastings sampler which uses the gradient and Hessian of the likelihood to dynamically tune the proposal. We demonstrate that a predictive model of brain response to stimuli can be improved by augmenting it with side information about the stimuli.	A Bayesian Matrix Factorization Model for Relational Data
1604.04198v4	In this article, we present the elitist particle filter based on evolutionary strategies (EPFES) as an efficient approach for nonlinear system identification. The EPFES is derived from the frequently-employed state-space model, where the relevant information of the nonlinear system is captured by an unknown state vector. Similar to classical particle filtering, the EPFES consists of a set of particles and respective weights which represent different realizations of the latent state vector and their likelihood of being the solution of the optimization problem. As main innovation, the EPFES includes an evolutionary elitist-particle selection which combines long-term information with instantaneous sampling from an approximated continuous posterior distribution. In this article, we propose two advancements of the previously-published elitist-particle selection process. Further, the EPFES is shown to be a generalization of the widely-used Gaussian particle filter and thus evaluated with respect to the latter for two completely different scenarios: First, we consider the so-called univariate nonstationary growth model with time-variant latent state variable, where the evolutionary selection of elitist particles is evaluated for non-recursively calculated particle weights. Second, the problem of nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation is addressed in a simulated scenario with speech as input signal: By using long-term fitness measures, we highlight the efficacy of the well-generalizing EPFES in estimating the nonlinear system even for large search spaces. Finally, we illustrate similarities between the EPFES and evolutionary algorithms to outline future improvements by fusing the achievements of both fields of research.

1704.02916v2	The standard interpretation of importance-weighted autoencoders is that they maximize a tighter lower bound on the marginal likelihood than the standard evidence lower bound. We give an alternate interpretation of this procedure: that it optimizes the standard variational lower bound, but using a more complex distribution. We formally derive this result, present a tighter lower bound, and visualize the implicit importance-weighted distribution.	Reinterpreting Importance-Weighted Autoencoders
1310.7855v1	We explore the performance of several automatic bandwidth selectors, originally designed for density gradient estimation, as data-based procedures for nonparametric, modal clustering. The key tool to obtain a clustering from density gradient estimators is the mean shift algorithm, which allows to obtain a partition not only of the data sample, but also of the whole space. The results of our simulation study suggest that most of the methods considered here, like cross validation and plug in bandwidth selectors, are useful for cluster analysis via the mean shift algorithm.	A comparison of bandwidth selectors for mean shift clustering
1506.04725v1	We propose a class of nonparametric two-sample tests with a cost linear in the sample size. Two tests are given, both based on an ensemble of distances between analytic functions representing each of the distributions. The first test uses smoothed empirical characteristic functions to represent the distributions, the second uses distribution embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Analyticity implies that differences in the distributions may be detected almost surely at a finite number of randomly chosen locations/frequencies. The new tests are consistent against a larger class of alternatives than the previous linear-time tests based on the (non-smoothed) empirical characteristic functions, while being much faster than the current state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based or energy distance-based tests. Experiments on artificial benchmarks and on challenging real-world testing problems demonstrate that our tests give a better power/time tradeoff than competing approaches, and in some cases, better outright power than even the most expensive quadratic-time tests. This performance advantage is retained even in high dimensions, and in cases where the difference in distributions is not observable with low order statistics.

1402.2148v1	Practical model building processes are often time-consuming because many different models must be trained and validated. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that can be used for computing the lower and the upper bounds of model validation errors without actually training the model itself. A key idea behind our algorithm is using a side information available from a suboptimal model. If a reasonably good suboptimal model is available, our algorithm can compute lower and upper bounds of many useful quantities for making inferences on the unknown target model. We demonstrate the advantage of our algorithm in the context of model selection for regularized learning problems.	An Algorithmic Framework for Computing Validation Performance Bounds by  Using Suboptimal Models
1205.3234v5	Hierarchical parametric models consisting of observable and latent variables are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. For example, a mixture model is a representative hierarchical model for clustering. From the statistical point of view, the models can be regular or singular due to the distribution of data. In the regular case, the models have the identifiability; there is one-to-one relation between a probability density function for the model expression and the parameter. The Fisher information matrix is positive definite, and the estimation accuracy of both observable and latent variables has been studied. In the singular case, on the other hand, the models are not identifiable and the Fisher matrix is not positive definite. Conventional statistical analysis based on the inverse Fisher matrix is not applicable. Recently, an algebraic geometrical analysis has been developed and is used to elucidate the Bayes estimation of observable variables. The present paper applies this analysis to latent-variable estimation and determines its theoretical performance. Our results clarify behavior of the convergence of the posterior distribution. It is found that the posterior of the observable-variable estimation can be different from the one in the latent-variable estimation. Because of the difference, the Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on the parameter and the latent variable cannot construct the desired posterior distribution.	Asymptotic Accuracy of Bayes Estimation for Latent Variables with  Redundancy
1405.0530v1	We propose a novel non-parametric adaptive anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional data based on rank-SVM. Data points are first ranked based on scores derived from nearest neighbor graphs on n-point nominal data. We then train a rank-SVM using this ranked data. A test-point is declared as an anomaly at alpha-false alarm level if the predicted score is in the alpha-percentile. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal and adaptive in that for any false alarm rate alpha, its decision region converges to the alpha-percentile level set of the unknown underlying density. In addition we illustrate through a number of synthetic and real-data experiments both the statistical performance and computational efficiency of our anomaly detector.

1304.5417v1	The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for multilook full polarimetric SAR data whose adequacy has been attested in the literature. Classification, segmentation, and image analysis techniques which depend on this model have been devised, and many of them employ some type of dissimilarity measure. In this paper we derive analytic expressions for four stochastic distances between relaxed scaled complex Wishart distributions in their most general form and in important particular cases. Using these distances, inequalities are obtained which lead to new ways of deriving the Bartlett and revised Wishart distances. The expressiveness of the four analytic distances is assessed with respect to the variation of parameters. Such distances are then used for deriving new tests statistics, which are proved to have asymptotic chi-square distribution. Adopting the test size as a comparison criterion, a sensitivity study is performed by means of Monte Carlo experiments suggesting that the Bhattacharyya statistic outperforms all the others. The power of the tests is also assessed. Applications to actual data illustrate the discrimination and homogeneity identification capabilities of these distances.

1011.3494v1	Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied problems in statistics and machine learning that have found many applications in science and engineering. However, exact inference is intractable in general graphical models, which suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a collection of random variables within some tractable family of graphical models. In this paper, we focus our attention on the class of planar Ising models, for which inference is tractable using techniques of statistical physics [Kac and Ward; Kasteleyn]. Based on these techniques and recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding [Chrobak and Payne], we propose a simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method in some simulations and for the application of modeling senate voting records.	Learning Planar Ising Models
1312.2967v3	This paper aims at justifying LWF and AMP chain graphs by showing that they do not represent arbitrary independence models. Specifically, we show that every chain graph is inclusion optimal wrt the intersection of the independence models represented by a set of directed and acyclic graphs under conditioning. This implies that the independence model represented by the chain graph can be accounted for by a set of causal models that are subject to selection bias, which in turn can be accounted for by a system that switches between different regimes or configurations.	Every LWF and AMP chain graph originates from a set of causal models

It describes the FCI+ algorithm: a method for sound and complete causal model discovery in the presence of latent confounders and/or selection bias, that has worst case polynomial complexity of order $N^{2(k+1)}$ in the number of independence tests, for sparse graphs over $N$ nodes, bounded by node degree $k$. The algorithm is an adaptation of the well-known FCI algorithm by (Spirtes et al., 2000) that is also sound and complete, but has worst case complexity exponential in $N$.

1306.0895v1	Optimal transportation distances are a fundamental family of parameterized distances for histograms. Despite their appealing theoretical properties, excellent performance in retrieval tasks and intuitive formulation, their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost is prohibitive whenever the histograms' dimension exceeds a few hundreds. We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn-Knopp's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers. We also report improved performance over classical optimal transportation distances on the MNIST benchmark problem.	Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transportation  Distances
1705.06189v3	In this paper, we present a novel method for co-clustering, an unsupervised learning approach that aims at discovering homogeneous groups of data instances and features by grouping them simultaneously. The proposed method uses the entropy regularized optimal transport between empirical measures defined on data instances and features in order to obtain an estimated joint probability density function represented by the optimal coupling matrix. This matrix is further factorized to obtain the induced row and columns partitions using multiscale representations approach. To justify our method theoretically, we show how the solution of the regularized optimal transport can be seen from the variational inference perspective thus motivating its use for co-clustering. The algorithm derived for the proposed method and its kernelized version based on the notion of Gromov-Wasserstein distance are fast, accurate and can determine automatically the number of both row and column clusters. These features are vividly demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluations.	Co-clustering through Optimal Transport
1703.03457v1	Indian Buffet Process based models are an elegant way for discovering underlying features within a data set, but inference in such models can be slow. Inferring underlying features using Markov chain Monte Carlo either relies on an uncollapsed representation, which leads to poor mixing, or on a collapsed representation, which leads to a quadratic increase in computational complexity. Existing attempts at distributing inference have introduced additional approximation within the inference procedure. In this paper we present a novel algorithm to perform asymptotically exact parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo inference for Indian Buffet Process models. We take advantage of the fact that the features are conditionally independent under the beta-Bernoulli process. Because of this conditional independence, we can partition the features into two parts: one part containing only the finitely many instantiated features and the other part containing the infinite tail of uninstantiated features. For the finite partition, parallel inference is simple given the instantiation of features. But for the infinite tail, performing uncollapsed MCMC leads to poor mixing and hence we collapse out the features. The resulting hybrid sampler, while being parallel, produces samples asymptotically from the true posterior.	Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo for the Indian Buffet Process
1511.07294v1	We consider convex-concave saddle point problems with a separable structure and non-strongly convex functions. We propose an efficient stochastic block coordinate descent method using adaptive primal-dual updates, which enables flexible parallel optimization for large-scale problems. Our method shares the efficiency and flexibility of block coordinate descent methods with the simplicity of primal-dual methods and utilizing the structure of the separable convex-concave saddle point problem. It is capable of solving a wide range of machine learning applications, including robust principal component analysis, Lasso, and feature selection by group Lasso, etc. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods in all these applications.

1107.2347v1	We describe a novel binary classification technique called Banded SVM (B-SVM). In the standard C-SVM formulation of Cortes et al. (1995), the decision rule is encouraged to lie in the interval [1, \infty]. The new B-SVM objective function contains a penalty term that encourages the decision rule to lie in a user specified range [\rho_1, \rho_2]. In addition to the standard set of support vectors (SVs) near the class boundaries, B-SVM results in a second set of SVs in the interior of each class.	BSVM: A Banded Suport Vector Machine
1512.07666v1	Effective training of deep neural networks suffers from two main issues. The first is that the parameter spaces of these models exhibit pathological curvature. Recent methods address this problem by using adaptive preconditioning for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These methods improve convergence by adapting to the local geometry of parameter space. A second issue is overfitting, which is typically addressed by early stopping. However, recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian model averaging mitigates this problem. The posterior can be sampled by using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). However, the rapidly changing curvature renders default SGLD methods inefficient. Here, we propose combining adaptive preconditioners with SGLD. In support of this idea, we give theoretical properties on asymptotic convergence and predictive risk. We also provide empirical results for Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Nets, and Convolutional Neural Nets, demonstrating that our preconditioned SGLD method gives state-of-the-art performance on these models.

1502.04416v5	We introduce and develop a novel approach to outlier detection based on adaptation of random subspace learning. Our proposed method handles both high-dimension low-sample size and traditional low-dimensional high-sample size datasets. Essentially, we avoid the computational bottleneck of techniques like minimum covariance determinant (MCD) by computing the needed determinants and associated measures in much lower dimensional subspaces. Both theoretical and computational development of our approach reveal that it is computationally more efficient than the regularized methods in high-dimensional low-sample size, and often competes favorably with existing methods as far as the percentage of correct outlier detection is concerned.

1710.10210v2	Consider an unknown smooth function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and say we are given $n$ noisy mod 1 samples of $f$, i.e., $y_i = (f(x_i) + \eta_i)\mod 1$ for $x_i \in [0,1]$, where $\eta_i$ denotes noise. Given the samples $(x_i,y_i)_{i=1}^{n}$, our goal is to recover smooth, robust estimates of the clean samples $f(x_i) \bmod 1$. We formulate a natural approach for solving this problem which works with angular embeddings of the noisy mod 1 samples over the unit complex circle, inspired by the angular synchronization framework. Our approach amounts to solving a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) which is NP-hard in its basic form, and therefore we consider its relaxation which is a trust region sub-problem and hence solvable efficiently. We demonstrate its robustness to noise via extensive numerical simulations on several synthetic examples, along with a detailed theoretical analysis. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first algorithm for denoising mod 1 samples of a smooth function, which comes with robustness guarantees.	On denoising modulo 1 samples of a function
1710.01720v1	Uncertainty analysis in the form of probabilistic forecasting can significantly improve decision making processes in the smart power grid for better integrating renewable energy sources such as wind. Whereas point forecasting provides a single expected value, probabilistic forecasts provide more information in the form of quantiles, prediction intervals, or full predictive densities. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of a novel approach for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power that combines a smooth approximation of the pinball loss function with a neural network architecture and a weighting initialization scheme to prevent the quantile cross over problem. A numerical case study is conducted using publicly available wind data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. Multiple quantiles are estimated to form 10%, to 90% prediction intervals which are evaluated using a quantile score and reliability measures. Benchmark models such as the persistence and climatology distributions, multiple quantile regression, and support vector quantile regression are used for comparison where results demonstrate the proposed approach leads to improved performance while preventing the problem of overlapping quantile estimates.

1201.4714v1	Support Vector Machines, SVMs, and the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor algorithm, LMNN, are two very popular learning algorithms with quite different learning biases. In this paper we bring them into a unified view and show that they have a much stronger relation than what is commonly thought. We analyze SVMs from a metric learning perspective and cast them as a metric learning problem, a view which helps us uncover the relations of the two algorithms. We show that LMNN can be seen as learning a set of local SVM-like models in a quadratic space. Along the way and inspired by the metric-based interpretation of SVM s we derive a novel variant of SVMs, epsilon-SVM, to which LMNN is even more similar. We give a unified view of LMNN and the different SVM variants. Finally we provide some preliminary experiments on a number of benchmark datasets in which show that epsilon-SVM compares favorably both with respect to LMNN and SVM.	A metric learning perspective of SVM: on the relation of SVM and LMNN
1802.03923v1	We study safe screening for metric learning. Distance metric learning can optimize a metric over a set of triplets, each one of which is defined by a pair of same class instances and an instance in a different class. However, the number of possible triplets is quite huge even for a small dataset. Our safe triplet screening identifies triplets which can be safely removed from the optimization problem without losing the optimality. Compared with existing safe screening studies, triplet screening is particularly significant because of (1) the huge number of possible triplets, and (2) the semi-definite constraint in the optimization. We derive several variants of screening rules, and analyze their relationships. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of safe triplet screening.

1311.0219v2	In this manuscript we consider the problem of jointly estimating multiple graphical models in high dimensions. We assume that the data are collected from n subjects, each of which consists of T possibly dependent observations. The graphical models of subjects vary, but are assumed to change smoothly corresponding to a measure of closeness between subjects. We propose a kernel based method for jointly estimating all graphical models. Theoretically, under a double asymptotic framework, where both (T,n) and the dimension d can increase, we provide the explicit rate of convergence in parameter estimation. It characterizes the strength one can borrow across different individuals and impact of data dependence on parameter estimation. Empirically, experiments on both synthetic and real resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Joint Estimation of Multiple Graphical Models from High Dimensional Time  Series
1611.05433v1	In this paper we combine two important extensions of ordinary least squares regression: regularization and optimal scaling. Optimal scaling (sometimes also called optimal scoring) has originally been developed for categorical data, and the process finds quantifications for the categories that are optimal for the regression model in the sense that they maximize the multiple correlation. Although the optimal scaling method was developed initially for variables with a limited number of categories, optimal transformations of continuous variables are a special case. We will consider a variety of transformation types; typically we use step functions for categorical variables, and smooth (spline) functions for continuous variables. Both types of functions can be restricted to be monotonic, preserving the ordinal information in the data. In addition to optimal scaling, three regularization methods will be considered: Ridge regression, the Lasso, and the Elastic Net. The resulting method will be called ROS Regression (Regularized Optimal Scaling Regression. We will show that the basic OS algorithm provides straightforward and efficient estimation of the regularized regression coefficients, automatically gives the Group Lasso and Blockwise Sparse Regression, and extends them with monotonicity properties. We will show that Optimal Scaling linearizes nonlinear relationships between predictors and outcome, and improves upon the condition of the predictor correlation matrix, increasing (on average) the conditional independence of the predictors. Alternative options for regularization of either regression coefficients or category quantifications are mentioned. Extended examples are provided. Keywords: Categorical Data, Optimal Scaling, Conditional Independence, Step Functions, Splines, Monotonic Transformations, Regularization, Lasso, Elastic Net, Group Lasso, Blockwise Sparse Regression.

1203.3472v1	"We extend the herding algorithm to continuous spaces by using the kernel trick. The resulting ""kernel herding"" algorithm is an infinite memory deterministic process that learns to approximate a PDF with a collection of samples. We show that kernel herding decreases the error of expectations of functions in the Hilbert space at a rate O(1/T) which is much faster than the usual O(1/pT) for iid random samples. We illustrate kernel herding by approximating Bayesian predictive distributions."	Super-Samples from Kernel Herding
1602.06701v1	We introduce a new approach for amortizing inference in directed graphical models by learning heuristic approximations to stochastic inverses, designed specifically for use as proposal distributions in sequential Monte Carlo methods. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning a structured neural network which represents an inverse factorization of the graphical model, resulting in a conditional density estimator that takes as input particular values of the observed random variables, and returns an approximation to the distribution of the latent variables. This recognition model can be learned offline, independent from any particular dataset, prior to performing inference. The output of these networks can be used as automatically-learned high-quality proposal distributions to accelerate sequential Monte Carlo across a diverse range of problem settings.

1802.09656v1	Latent variable models with hidden binary units appear in various applications. Learning such models, in particular in the presence of noise, is a challenging computational problem. In this paper we propose a novel spectral approach to this problem, based on the eigenvectors of both the second order moment matrix and third order moment tensor of the observed data. We prove that under mild non-degeneracy conditions, our method consistently estimates the model parameters at the optimal parametric rate. Our tensor-based method generalizes previous orthogonal tensor decomposition approaches, where the hidden units were assumed to be either statistically independent or mutually exclusive. We illustrate the consistency of our method on simulated data and demonstrate its usefulness in learning a common model for population mixtures in genetics.

1507.04436v1	We consider factoring low-rank tensors in the presence of outlying slabs. This problem is important in practice, because data collected in many real-world applications, such as speech, fluorescence, and some social network data, fit this paradigm. Prior work tackles this problem by iteratively selecting a fixed number of slabs and fitting, a procedure which may not converge. We formulate this problem from a group-sparsity promoting point of view, and propose an alternating optimization framework to handle the corresponding $\ell_p$ ($0<p\leq 1$) minimization-based low-rank tensor factorization problem. The proposed algorithm features a similar per-iteration complexity as the plain trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is also easy to analyze under the framework of alternating optimization and its variants. In addition, regularization and constraints can be easily incorporated to make use of \emph{a priori} information on the latent loading factors. Simulations and real data experiments on blind speech separation, fluorescence data analysis, and social network mining are used to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

1408.5810v2	This paper introduces Kernel-based Information Criterion (KIC) for model selection in regression analysis. The novel kernel-based complexity measure in KIC efficiently computes the interdependency between parameters of the model using a variable-wise variance and yields selection of better, more robust regressors. Experimental results show superior performance on both simulated and real data sets compared to Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), kernel-based Information Complexity (ICOMP), and maximum log of marginal likelihood in Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).

1204.5043v2	We derive a novel norm that corresponds to the tightest convex relaxation of sparsity combined with an $\ell_2$ penalty. We show that this new {\em $k$-support norm} provides a tighter relaxation than the elastic net and is thus a good replacement for the Lasso or the elastic net in sparse prediction problems. Through the study of the $k$-support norm, we also bound the looseness of the elastic net, thus shedding new light on it and providing justification for its use.	Sparse Prediction with the $k$-Support Norm
1005.1440v1	The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma allows for the projection of $n$ points in $p-$dimensional Euclidean space onto a $k-$dimensional Euclidean space, with $k \ge \frac{24\ln \emph{n}}{3\epsilon^2-2\epsilon^3}$, so that the pairwise distances are preserved within a factor of $1\pm\epsilon$. Here, working directly with the distributions of the random distances rather than resorting to the moment generating function technique, an improvement on the lower bound for $k$ is obtained. The additional reduction in dimension when compared to bounds found in the literature, is at least $13\%$, and, in some cases, up to $30\%$ additional reduction is achieved. Using the moment generating function technique, we further provide a lower bound for $k$ using pairwise $L_2$ distances in the space of points to be projected and pairwise $L_1$ distances in the space of the projected points. Comparison with the results obtained in the literature shows that the bound presented here provides an additional $36-40\%$ reduction.	Improving the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma
1310.3003v3	A novel linear classification method that possesses the merits of both the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the Distance-weighted Discrimination (DWD) is proposed in this article. The proposed Distance-weighted Support Vector Machine method can be viewed as a hybrid of SVM and DWD that finds the classification direction by minimizing mainly the DWD loss, and determines the intercept term in the SVM manner. We show that our method inheres the merit of DWD, and hence, overcomes the data-piling and overfitting issue of SVM. On the other hand, the new method is not subject to imbalanced data issue which was a main advantage of SVM over DWD. It uses an unusual loss which combines the Hinge loss (of SVM) and the DWD loss through a trick of axillary hyperplane. Several theoretical properties, including Fisher consistency and asymptotic normality of the DWSVM solution are developed. We use some simulated examples to show that the new method can compete DWD and SVM on both classification performance and interpretability. A real data application further establishes the usefulness of our approach.	Distance-weighted Support Vector Machine
1705.10817v1	Numerous social, medical, engineering and biological challenges can be framed as graph-based learning tasks. Here, we propose a new feature based approach to network classification. We show how dynamics on a network can be useful to reveal patterns about the organization of the components of the underlying graph where the process takes place. We define generalized assortativities on networks and use them as generalized features across multiple time scales. These features turn out to be suitable signatures for discriminating between different classes of networks. Our method is evaluated empirically on established network benchmarks. We also introduce a new dataset of human brain networks (connectomes) and use it to evaluate our method. Results reveal that our dynamics based features are competitive and often outperform state of the art accuracies.	Dynamics Based Features For Graph Classification
1607.03026v1	We present new methods to estimate causal effects retrospectively from micro data with the assistance of a machine learning ensemble. This approach overcomes two important limitations in conventional methods like regression modeling or matching: (i) ambiguity about the pertinent retrospective counterfactuals and (ii) potential misspecification, overfitting, and otherwise bias-prone or inefficient use of a large identifying covariate set in the estimation of causal effects. Our method targets the analysis toward a well defined ``retrospective intervention effect'' (RIE) based on hypothetical population interventions and applies a machine learning ensemble that allows data to guide us, in a controlled fashion, on how to use a large identifying covariate set. We illustrate with an analysis of policy options for reducing ex-combatant recidivism in Colombia.

1406.3824v3	Crowdsourcing is a popular paradigm for effectively collecting labels at low cost. The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers. However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other recently proposed methods.

1109.5894v1	User preferences for items can be inferred from either explicit feedback, such as item ratings, or implicit feedback, such as rental histories. Research in collaborative filtering has concentrated on explicit feedback, resulting in the development of accurate and scalable models. However, since explicit feedback is often difficult to collect it is important to develop effective models that take advantage of the more widely available implicit feedback. We introduce a probabilistic approach to collaborative filtering with implicit feedback based on modelling the user's item selection process. In the interests of scalability, we restrict our attention to tree-structured distributions over items and develop a principled and efficient algorithm for learning item trees from data. We also identify a problem with a widely used protocol for evaluating implicit feedback models and propose a way of addressing it using a small quantity of explicit feedback data.	Learning Item Trees for Probabilistic Modelling of Implicit Feedback
1111.4226v1	We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to the problem of jointly modeling multiple related time series. Our approach is based on the discovery of a set of latent, shared dynamical behaviors. Using a beta process prior, the size of the set and the sharing pattern are both inferred from data. We develop efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on the Indian buffet process representation of the predictive distribution of the beta process, without relying on a truncated model. In particular, our approach uses the sum-product algorithm to efficiently compute Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities, and explores new dynamical behaviors via birth and death proposals. We examine the benefits of our proposed feature-based model on several synthetic datasets, and also demonstrate promising results on unsupervised segmentation of visual motion capture data.

1710.01641v1	We lay theoretical foundations for new database release mechanisms that allow third-parties to construct consistent estimators of population statistics, while ensuring that the privacy of each individual contributing to the database is protected. The proposed framework rests on two main ideas. First, releasing (an estimate of) the kernel mean embedding of the data generating random variable instead of the database itself still allows third-parties to construct consistent estimators of a wide class of population statistics. Second, the algorithm can satisfy the definition of differential privacy by basing the released kernel mean embedding on entirely synthetic data points, while controlling accuracy through the metric available in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We describe two instantiations of the proposed framework, suitable under different scenarios, and prove theoretical results guaranteeing differential privacy of the resulting algorithms and the consistency of estimators constructed from their outputs.

1202.3726v1	We consider active, semi-supervised learning in an offline transductive setting. We show that a previously proposed error bound for active learning on undirected weighted graphs can be generalized by replacing graph cut with an arbitrary symmetric submodular function. Arbitrary non-symmetric submodular functions can be used via symmetrization. Different choices of submodular functions give different versions of the error bound that are appropriate for different kinds of problems. Moreover, the bound is deterministic and holds for adversarially chosen labels. We show exactly minimizing this error bound is NP-complete. However, we also introduce for any submodular function an associated active semi-supervised learning method that approximately minimizes the corresponding error bound. We show that the error bound is tight in the sense that there is no other bound of the same form which is better. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments on real data.	Active Semi-Supervised Learning using Submodular Functions
1202.3763v1	Probabilistic inference in graphical models is the task of computing marginal and conditional densities of interest from a factorized representation of a joint probability distribution. Inference algorithms such as variable elimination and belief propagation take advantage of constraints embedded in this factorization to compute such densities efficiently. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which computes interventional distributions in latent variable causal models represented by acyclic directed mixed graphs(ADMGs). To compute these distributions efficiently, we take advantage of a recursive factorization which generalizes the usual Markov factorization for DAGs and the more recent factorization for ADMGs. Our algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of variable elimination to the mixed graph case. We show our algorithm is exponential in the mixed graph generalization of treewidth.	An Efficient Algorithm for Computing Interventional Distributions in  Latent Variable Causal Models
1211.4706v1	Many random processes can be simulated as the output of a deterministic model accepting random inputs. Such a model usually describes a complex mathematical or physical stochastic system and the randomness is introduced in the input variables of the model. When the statistics of the output event are known, these input variables have to be chosen in a specific way for the output to have the prescribed statistics. Because the probability distribution of the input random variables is not directly known but dictated implicitly by the statistics of the output random variables, this problem is usually intractable for classical sampling methods. Based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo we propose a novel method to sample random inputs to such models by introducing a modification to the standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. As an example we consider a system described by a stochastic differential equation (sde) and demonstrate how sample paths of a random process satisfying this sde can be generated with our technique.

1311.3257v2	We propose a method for inferring the conditional indepen- dence graph (CIG) of a high-dimensional discrete-time Gaus- sian vector random process from finite-length observations. Our approach does not rely on a parametric model (such as, e.g., an autoregressive model) for the vector random process; rather, it only assumes certain spectral smoothness proper- ties. The proposed inference scheme is compressive in that it works for sample sizes that are (much) smaller than the number of scalar process components. We provide analytical conditions for our method to correctly identify the CIG with high probability.	Compressive Nonparametric Graphical Model Selection For Time Series
1506.09068v2	Factorized Information Criterion (FIC) is a recently developed information criterion, based on which a novel model selection methodology, namely Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) Inference, has been developed and successfully applied to various hierarchical Bayesian models. The Dirichlet Process (DP) prior, and one of its well known representations, the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP), derive another line of model selection methods. FIC can be viewed as a prior distribution over the latent variable configurations. Under this view, we prove that when the parameter dimensionality $D_{c}=2$, FIC is equivalent to CRP. We argue that when $D_{c}>2$, FIC avoids an inherent problem of DP/CRP, i.e. the data likelihood will dominate the impact of the prior, and thus the model selection capability will weaken as $D_{c}$ increases. However, FIC overestimates the data likelihood. As a result, FIC may be overly biased towards models with less components. We propose a natural generalization of FIC, which finds a middle ground between CRP and FIC, and may yield more accurate model selection results than FIC.	On the Equivalence of Factorized Information Criterion Regularization  and the Chinese Restaurant Process Prior
1512.08861v1	We study the fundamental tradeoffs between computational tractability and statistical accuracy for a general family of hypothesis testing problems with combinatorial structures. Based upon an oracle model of computation, which captures the interactions between algorithms and data, we establish a general lower bound that explicitly connects the minimum testing risk under computational budget constraints with the intrinsic probabilistic and combinatorial structures of statistical problems. This lower bound mirrors the classical statistical lower bound by Le Cam (1986) and allows us to quantify the optimal statistical performance achievable given limited computational budgets in a systematic fashion. Under this unified framework, we sharply characterize the statistical-computational phase transition for two testing problems, namely, normal mean detection and sparse principal component detection. For normal mean detection, we consider two combinatorial structures, namely, sparse set and perfect matching. For these problems we identify significant gaps between the optimal statistical accuracy that is achievable under computational tractability constraints and the classical statistical lower bounds. Compared with existing works on computational lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms on Turing machines, and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection, we focus on the oracle computational model, which covers a broad range of popular algorithms, and do not rely on unproven hypotheses. Moreover, our result provides an intuitive and concrete interpretation for the intrinsic computational intractability of high-dimensional statistical problems. One byproduct of our result is a lower bound for a strict generalization of the matrix permanent problem, which is of independent interest.

0906.5190v1	This paper introduces a new method for semi-supervised learning on high dimensional nonlinear manifolds, which includes a phase of unsupervised basis learning and a phase of supervised function learning. The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point $x$ on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, with the linear weights offering a local-coordinate coding of $x$. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difficult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods. The work also gives a theoretical justification to the empirical success of some biologically-inspired models using sparse coding of sensory data, since a local coding scheme must be sufficiently sparse. However, sparsity does not always satisfy locality conditions, and can thus possibly lead to suboptimal results. The properties and performances of the method are empirically verified on synthetic data, handwritten digit classification, and object recognition tasks.	High Dimensional Nonlinear Learning using Local Coordinate Coding
1312.5066v1	It is the main goal of this article to address the bipartite ranking issue from the perspective of functional data analysis (FDA). Given a training set of independent realizations of a (possibly sampled) second-order random function with a (locally) smooth autocorrelation structure and to which a binary label is randomly assigned, the objective is to learn a scoring function s with optimal ROC curve. Based on linear/nonlinear wavelet-based approximations, it is shown how to select compact finite dimensional representations of the input curves adaptively, in order to build accurate ranking rules, using recent advances in the ranking problem for multivariate data with binary feedback. Beyond theoretical considerations, the performance of the learning methods for functional bipartite ranking proposed in this paper are illustrated by numerical experiments.

1510.08406v1	Kernel methods obtain superb performance in terms of accuracy for various machine learning tasks since they can effectively extract nonlinear relations. However, their time complexity can be rather large especially for clustering tasks. In this paper we define a general class of kernels that can be easily approximated by randomization. These kernels appear in various applications, in particular, traditional spectral clustering, landmark-based spectral clustering and landmark-based subspace clustering. We show that for $n$ data points from $K$ clusters with $D$ landmarks, the randomization procedure results in an algorithm of complexity $O(KnD)$. Furthermore, we bound the error between the original clustering scheme and its randomization. To illustrate the power of this framework, we propose a new fast landmark subspace (FLS) clustering algorithm. Experiments over synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superior performance of FLS in accelerating subspace clustering with marginal sacrifice of accuracy.	Fast Landmark Subspace Clustering
1508.02905v1	Dropout has recently emerged as a powerful and simple method for training neural networks preventing co-adaptation by stochastically omitting neurons. Dropout is currently not grounded in explicit modelling assumptions which so far has precluded its adoption in Bayesian modelling. Using Bayesian entropic reasoning we show that dropout can be interpreted as optimal inference under constraints. We demonstrate this on an analytically tractable regression model providing a Bayesian interpretation of its mechanism for regularizing and preventing co-adaptation as well as its connection to other Bayesian techniques. We also discuss two general approximate techniques for applying Bayesian dropout for general models, one based on an analytical approximation and the other on stochastic variational techniques. These techniques are then applied to a Baysian logistic regression problem and are shown to improve performance as the model become more misspecified. Our framework roots dropout as a theoretically justified and practical tool for statistical modelling allowing Bayesians to tap into the benefits of dropout training.	Bayesian Dropout
1610.04798v1	We propose a communication-efficient distributed estimation method for sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the high dimensional regime. Our method distributes the data of size $N$ into $m$ machines, and estimates a local sparse LDA estimator on each machine using the data subset of size $N/m$. After the distributed estimation, our method aggregates the debiased local estimators from $m$ machines, and sparsifies the aggregated estimator. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimation method, as long as the number of machines $m$ is chosen appropriately. Moreover, we prove that our method can attain the model selection consistency under a milder condition than the centralized method. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory.	Communication-efficient Distributed Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis
1701.01437v2	This workshop explores the interface between cognitive neuroscience and recent advances in AI fields that aim to reproduce human performance such as natural language processing and computer vision, and specifically deep learning approaches to such problems. When studying the cognitive capabilities of the brain, scientists follow a system identification approach in which they present different stimuli to the subjects and try to model the response that different brain areas have of that stimulus. The goal is to understand the brain by trying to find the function that expresses the activity of brain areas in terms of different properties of the stimulus. Experimental stimuli are becoming increasingly complex with more and more people being interested in studying real life phenomena such as the perception of natural images or natural sentences. There is therefore a need for a rich and adequate vector representation of the properties of the stimulus, that we can obtain using advances in machine learning. In parallel, new ML approaches, many of which in deep learning, are inspired to a certain extent by human behavior or biological principles. Neural networks for example were originally inspired by biological neurons. More recently, processes such as attention are being used which have are inspired by human behavior. However, the large bulk of these methods are independent of findings about brain function, and it is unclear whether it is at all beneficial for machine learning to try to emulate brain function in order to achieve the same tasks that the brain achieves.

1001.0279v1	"We consider the problem of reconstructing a low rank matrix from noisy observations of a subset of its entries. This task has applications in statistical learning, computer vision, and signal processing. In these contexts, ""noise"" generically refers to any contribution to the data that is not captured by the low-rank model. In most applications, the noise level is large compared to the underlying signal and it is important to avoid overfitting. In order to tackle this problem, we define a regularized cost function well suited for spectral reconstruction methods. Within a random noise model, and in the large system limit, we prove that the resulting accuracy undergoes a phase transition depending on the noise level and on the fraction of observed entries. The cost function can be minimized using OPTSPACE (a manifold gradient descent algorithm). Numerical simulations show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art alternatives."

1401.2497v1	A new shrinkage-based construction is developed for a compressible vector $\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathbb{R}^n$, for cases in which the components of $\xv$ are naturally associated with a tree structure. Important examples are when $\xv$ corresponds to the coefficients of a wavelet or block-DCT representation of data. The method we consider in detail, and for which numerical results are presented, is based on increments of a gamma process. However, we demonstrate that the general framework is appropriate for many other types of shrinkage priors, all within the L\'{e}vy process family, with the gamma process a special case. Bayesian inference is carried out by approximating the posterior with samples from an MCMC algorithm, as well as by constructing a heuristic variational approximation to the posterior. We also consider expectation-maximization (EM) for a MAP (point) solution. State-of-the-art results are manifested for compressive sensing and denoising applications, the latter with spiky (non-Gaussian) noise.	Multiscale Shrinkage and Lévy Processes
1509.04781v1	Tree structures are ubiquitous in data across many domains, and many datasets are naturally modelled by unobserved tree structures. In this paper, first we review the theory of random fragmentation processes [Bertoin, 2006], and a number of existing methods for modelling trees, including the popular nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP). Then we define a general class of probability distributions over trees: the Dirichlet fragmentation process (DFP) through a novel combination of the theory of Dirichlet processes and random fragmentation processes. This DFP presents a stick-breaking construction, and relates to the nCRP in the same way the Dirichlet process relates to the Chinese restaurant process. Furthermore, we develop a novel hierarchical mixture model with the DFP, and empirically compare the new model to similar models in machine learning. Experiments show the DFP mixture model to be convincingly better than existing state-of-the-art approaches for hierarchical clustering and density modelling.	Dirichlet Fragmentation Processes
1707.07124v2	Mobile technologies offer opportunities for higher resolution monitoring of health conditions. This opportunity seems of particular promise in psychiatry where diagnoses often rely on retrospective and subjective recall of mood states. However, getting actionable information from these rather complex time series is challenging, and at present the implications for clinical care are largely hypothetical. This research demonstrates that, with well chosen cohorts (of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and control) and modern methods, it is possible to objectively learn to identify distinctive behaviour over short periods (20 reports) that effectively separate the cohorts. Participants with bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder and healthy volunteers completed daily mood ratings using a bespoke smartphone app for up to a year. A signature-based machine learning model was used to classify participants on the basis of the interrelationship between the different mood items assessed and to predict subsequent mood. The signature methodology was significantly superior to earlier statistical approaches applied to this data in distinguishing the participant three groups, clearly placing 75% into their original groups on the basis of their reports. Subsequent mood ratings were correctly predicted with greater than 70% accuracy in all groups. Prediction of mood was most accurate in healthy volunteers (89-98%) compared to bipolar disorder (82-90%) and borderline personality disorder (70-78%).

1607.01624v1	We propose a Bayesian nonparametric prior for time-varying networks. To each node of the network is associated a positive parameter, modeling the sociability of that node. Sociabilities are assumed to evolve over time, and are modeled via a dynamic point process model. The model is able to (a) capture smooth evolution of the interaction between nodes, allowing edges to appear/disappear over time (b) capture long term evolution of the sociabilities of the nodes (c) and yield sparse graphs, where the number of edges grows subquadratically with the number of nodes. The evolution of the sociabilities is described by a tractable time-varying gamma process. We provide some theoretical insights into the model and apply it to three real world datasets.	Bayesian nonparametrics for Sparse Dynamic Networks
1801.02939v1	Deep Gaussian Processes (DGP) are hierarchical generalizations of Gaussian Processes (GP) that have proven to work effectively on a multiple supervised regression tasks. They combine the well calibrated uncertainty estimates of GPs with the great flexibility of multilayer models. In DGPs, given the inputs, the outputs of the layers are Gaussian distributions parameterized by their means and covariances. These layers are realized as Sparse GPs where the training data is approximated using a small set of pseudo points. In this work, we show that the computational cost of DGPs can be reduced with no loss in performance by using a separate, smaller set of pseudo points when calculating the layerwise variance while using a larger set of pseudo points when calculating the layerwise mean. This enabled us to train larger models that have lower cost and better predictive performance.	Deep Gaussian Processes with Decoupled Inducing Inputs
1112.5745v1	Information theoretic active learning has been widely studied for probabilistic models. For simple regression an optimal myopic policy is easily tractable. However, for other tasks and with more complex models, such as classification with nonparametric models, the optimal solution is harder to compute. Current approaches make approximations to achieve tractability. We propose an approach that expresses information gain in terms of predictive entropies, and apply this method to the Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC). Our approach makes minimal approximations to the full information theoretic objective. Our experimental performance compares favourably to many popular active learning algorithms, and has equal or lower computational complexity. We compare well to decision theoretic approaches also, which are privy to more information and require much more computational time. Secondly, by developing further a reformulation of binary preference learning to a classification problem, we extend our algorithm to Gaussian Process preference learning.	Bayesian Active Learning for Classification and Preference Learning
1802.04474v1	We theoretically discuss why deep neural networks (DNNs) performs better than other models in some cases by investigating statistical properties of DNNs for non-smooth functions. While DNNs have empirically shown higher performance than other standard methods, understanding its mechanism is still a challenging problem. From an aspect of the statistical theory, it is known many standard methods attain optimal convergence rates, and thus it has been difficult to find theoretical advantages of DNNs. This paper fills this gap by considering learning of a certain class of non-smooth functions, which was not covered by the previous theory. We derive convergence rates of estimators by DNNs with a ReLU activation, and show that the estimators by DNNs are almost optimal to estimate the non-smooth functions, while some of the popular models do not attain the optimal rate. In addition, our theoretical result provides guidelines for selecting an appropriate number of layers and edges of DNNs. We provide numerical experiments to support the theoretical results.	Deep Neural Networks Learn Non-Smooth Functions Effectively
1711.01861v1	Mechanistic models of single-neuron dynamics have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience. However, identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.	Flexible statistical inference for mechanistic models of neural dynamics
1707.09049v2	State space models provide an interpretable framework for complex time series by combining an intuitive dynamical system model with a probabilistic observation model. We developed a flexible online learning framework for latent nonlinear state dynamics and filtered latent states. Our method utilizes the stochastic gradient variational Bayes method to jointly optimize the parameters of the nonlinear dynamics, observation model, and the black-box recognition model. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can incorporate non-trivial observation noise models and infer in real-time. We test our method on point process observations driven by continuous attractor dynamics, demonstrating its ability to recover the phase portrait, filtered trajectory, and produce long-term predictions for real-time machine learning.	Variational Recursive Dual Filtering
1212.2126v2	The classical mixture of Gaussians model is related to K-means via small-variance asymptotics: as the covariances of the Gaussians tend to zero, the negative log-likelihood of the mixture of Gaussians model approaches the K-means objective, and the EM algorithm approaches the K-means algorithm. Kulis & Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework.

1112.4394v1	We introduce a Gaussian process model of functions which are additive. An additive function is one which decomposes into a sum of low-dimensional functions, each depending on only a subset of the input variables. Additive GPs generalize both Generalized Additive Models, and the standard GP models which use squared-exponential kernels. Hyperparameter learning in this model can be seen as Bayesian Hierarchical Kernel Learning (HKL). We introduce an expressive but tractable parameterization of the kernel function, which allows efficient evaluation of all input interaction terms, whose number is exponential in the input dimension. The additional structure discoverable by this model results in increased interpretability, as well as state-of-the-art predictive power in regression tasks.	Additive Gaussian Processes
1604.01972v2	The estimation of normalizing constants is a fundamental step in probabilistic model comparison. Sequential Monte Carlo methods may be used for this task and have the advantage of being inherently parallelizable. However, the standard choice of using a fixed number of particles at each iteration is suboptimal because some steps will contribute disproportionately to the variance of the estimate. We introduce an adaptive version of the Resample-Move algorithm, in which the particle set is adaptively expanded whenever a better approximation of an intermediate distribution is needed. The algorithm builds on the expression for the optimal number of particles and the corresponding minimum variance found under ideal conditions. Benchmark results on challenging Gaussian Process Classification and Restricted Boltzmann Machine applications show that Adaptive Resample-Move (ARM) estimates the normalizing constant with a smaller variance, using less computational resources, than either Resample-Move with a fixed number of particles or Annealed Importance Sampling. A further advantage over Annealed Importance Sampling is that ARM is easier to tune.	An Adaptive Resample-Move Algorithm for Estimating Normalizing Constants
1502.02344v2	Careful tuning of a regularization parameter is indispensable in many machine learning tasks because it has a significant impact on generalization performances. Nevertheless, current practice of regularization parameter tuning is more of an art than a science, e.g., it is hard to tell how many grid-points would be needed in cross-validation (CV) for obtaining a solution with sufficiently small CV error. In this paper we propose a novel framework for computing a lower bound of the CV errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which we call regularization path of CV error lower bounds. The proposed framework can be used for providing a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions in the sense that how far the CV error of the current best solution could be away from best possible CV error in the entire range of the regularization parameters. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that a theoretically guaranteed a choice of regularization parameter in the above sense is possible with reasonable computational costs.	Regularization Path of Cross-Validation Error Lower Bounds
1801.10395v2	State-space models (SSMs) are a highly expressive model class for learning patterns in time series data and for system identification. Deterministic versions of SSMs (e.g. LSTMs) proved extremely successful in modeling complex time series data. Fully probabilistic SSMs, however, are often found hard to train, even for smaller problems. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel model formulation and a scalable training algorithm based on doubly stochastic variational inference and Gaussian processes. In contrast to existing work, the proposed variational approximation allows one to fully capture the latent state temporal correlations. These correlations are the key to robust training. The effectiveness of the proposed PR-SSM is evaluated on a set of real-world benchmark datasets in comparison to state-of-the-art probabilistic model learning methods. Scalability and robustness are demonstrated on a high dimensional problem.	Probabilistic Recurrent State-Space Models
1406.3469v4	We propose LOCO, an algorithm for large-scale ridge regression which distributes the features across workers on a cluster. Important dependencies between variables are preserved using structured random projections which are cheap to compute and must only be communicated once. We show that LOCO obtains a solution which is close to the exact ridge regression solution in the fixed design setting. We verify this experimentally in a simulation study as well as an application to climate prediction. Furthermore, we show that LOCO achieves significant speedups compared with a state-of-the-art distributed algorithm on a large-scale regression problem.	LOCO: Distributing Ridge Regression with Random Projections
1203.3476v1	We consider learning continuous probabilistic graphical models in the face of missing data. For non-Gaussian models, learning the parameters and structure of such models depends on our ability to perform efficient inference, and can be prohibitive even for relatively modest domains. Recently, we introduced the Copula Bayesian Network (CBN) density model - a flexible framework that captures complex high-dimensional dependency structures while offering direct control over the univariate marginals, leading to improved generalization. In this work we show that the CBN model also offers significant computational advantages when training data is partially observed. Concretely, we leverage on the specialized form of the model to derive a computationally amenable learning objective that is a lower bound on the log-likelihood function. Importantly, our energy-like bound circumvents the need for costly inference of an auxiliary distribution, thus facilitating practical learning of highdimensional densities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning the structure and parameters of a CBN model for two reallife continuous domains.

1605.02541v2	We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We prove the existence of an optimal MAPE model and we show the universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization based on the MAPE. We also show that finding the best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression, and we apply this weighting strategy to kernel regression. The behavior of the MAPE kernel regression is illustrated on simulated data.	Mean Absolute Percentage Error for regression models
1705.07585v2	The increasing size and complexity of scientific data could dramatically enhance discovery and prediction for basic scientific applications. Realizing this potential, however, requires novel statistical analysis methods that are both interpretable and predictive. We introduce Union of Intersections (UoI), a flexible, modular, and scalable framework for enhanced model selection and estimation. Methods based on UoI perform model selection and model estimation through intersection and union operations, respectively. We show that UoI-based methods achieve low-variance and nearly unbiased estimation of a small number of interpretable features, while maintaining high-quality prediction accuracy. We perform extensive numerical investigation to evaluate a UoI algorithm ($UoI_{Lasso}$) on synthetic and real data. In doing so, we demonstrate the extraction of interpretable functional networks from human electrophysiology recordings as well as accurate prediction of phenotypes from genotype-phenotype data with reduced features. We also show (with the $UoI_{L1Logistic}$ and $UoI_{CUR}$ variants of the basic framework) improved prediction parsimony for classification and matrix factorization on several benchmark biomedical data sets. These results suggest that methods based on the UoI framework could improve interpretation and prediction in data-driven discovery across scientific fields.

1612.02528v1	Bagging is a device intended for reducing the prediction error of learning algorithms. In its simplest form, bagging draws bootstrap samples from the training sample, applies the learning algorithm to each bootstrap sample, and then averages the resulting prediction rules. We extend the definition of bagging from statistics to statistical functionals and study the von Mises expansion of bagged statistical functionals. We show that the expansion is related to the Efron-Stein ANOVA expansion of the raw (unbagged) functional. The basic observation is that a bagged functional is always smooth in the sense that the von Mises expansion exists and is finite of length 1 + resample size $M$. This holds even if the raw functional is rough or unstable. The resample size $M$ acts as a smoothing parameter, where a smaller $M$ means more smoothing.

1508.01248v1	Gaussian process (GP) regression is a powerful tool for building predictive models for spatial systems. However, it does not scale efficiently for large datasets. Particularly, for high-dimensional spatial datasets, i.e., spatial datasets that contain exogenous variables, the performance of GP regression further deteriorates. This paper presents the Sparse Pseudo-input Local Kriging (SPLK) which approximates the full GP for spatial datasets with exogenous variables. SPLK employs orthogonal cuts which decompose the domain into smaller subdomains and then applies a sparse approximation of the full GP in each subdomain. We obtain the continuity of the global predictor by imposing continuity constraints on the boundaries of the neighboring subdomains. The domain decomposition scheme applies independent covariance structures in each region, and as a result, SPLK captures heterogeneous covariance structures. SPLK achieves computational efficiency by utilizing sparse approximation in each subdomain which enables SPLK to accommodate large subdomains that contain many data points and possess a homogenous covariance structure. We Apply the proposed method to real and simulated datasets. We conclude that the combination of orthogonal cuts and sparse approximation makes the proposed method an efficient algorithm for high-dimensional large spatial datasets.

1512.07662v1	Learning in deep models using Bayesian methods has generated significant attention recently. This is largely because of the feasibility of modern Bayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a measure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for large-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient thermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a thermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior distributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion increases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so better use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use of an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the traditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more accurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be desirable in Bayesian deep learning. Extensive experiments on two canonical models and their deep extensions demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves general Bayesian posterior sampling, particularly for deep models.	High-Order Stochastic Gradient Thermostats for Bayesian Learning of Deep  Models
1205.2660v1	We present an objective function for learning with unlabeled data that utilizes auxiliary expectation constraints. We optimize this objective function using a procedure that alternates between information and moment projections. Our method provides an alternate interpretation of the posterior regularization framework (Graca et al., 2008), maintains uncertainty during optimization unlike constraint-driven learning (Chang et al., 2007), and is more efficient than generalized expectation criteria (Mann & McCallum, 2008). Applications of this framework include minimally supervised learning, semisupervised learning, and learning with constraints that are more expressive than the underlying model. In experiments, we demonstrate comparable accuracy to generalized expectation criteria for minimally supervised learning, and use expressive structural constraints to guide semi-supervised learning, providing a 3%-6% improvement over stateof-the-art constraint-driven learning.	Alternating Projections for Learning with Expectation Constraints
1112.2679v1	This paper considers the sparse eigenvalue problem, which is to extract dominant (largest) sparse eigenvectors with at most $k$ non-zero components. We propose a simple yet effective solution called truncated power method that can approximately solve the underlying nonconvex optimization problem. A strong sparse recovery result is proved for the truncated power method, and this theory is our key motivation for developing the new algorithm. The proposed method is tested on applications such as sparse principal component analysis and the densest $k$-subgraph problem. Extensive experiments on several synthetic and real-world large scale datasets demonstrate the competitive empirical performance of our method.	Truncated Power Method for Sparse Eigenvalue Problems
1704.02370v2	The Temporal Group LASSO is an example of a multi-task, regularized regression approach for the prediction of response variables that vary over time. The aim of this work is to introduce the reader to the concepts behind the Temporal Group LASSO and its related methods, as well as to the type of potential applications in a healthcare setting that the method has. We argue that the method is attractive because of its ability to reduce overfitting, select predictors, learn smooth effect patterns over time, and finally, its simplicity	A Brief Introduction to the Temporal Group LASSO and its Potential  Applications in Healthcare
1210.8429v1	"Given a time series of graphs G(t) = (V, E(t)), t = 1, 2, ..., where the fixed vertex set V represents ""actors"" and an edge between vertex u and vertex v at time t (uv \in E(t)) represents the existence of a communications event between actors u and v during the tth time period, we wish to detect anomalies and/or change points. We consider a collection of graph features, or invariants, and demonstrate that adaptive fusion provides superior inferential efficacy compared to naive equal weighting for a certain class of anomaly detection problems. Simulation results using a latent process model for time series of graphs, as well as illustrative experimental results for a time series of graphs derived from the Enron email data, show that a fusion statistic can provide superior inference compared to individual invariants alone. These results also demonstrate that an adaptive weighting scheme for fusion of invariants performs better than naive equal weighting."

1710.02262v1	The emergence of mobile games has caused a paradigm shift in the video-game industry. Game developers now have at their disposal a plethora of information on their players, and thus can take advantage of reliable models that can accurately predict player behavior and scale to huge datasets. Churn prediction, a challenge common to a variety of sectors, is particularly relevant for the mobile game industry, as player retention is crucial for the successful monetization of a game. In this article, we present an approach to predicting game abandon based on survival ensembles. Our method provides accurate predictions on both the level at which each player will leave the game and their accumulated playtime until that moment. Further, it is robust to different data distributions and applicable to a wide range of response variables, while also allowing for efficient parallelization of the algorithm. This makes our model well suited to perform real-time analyses of churners, even for games with millions of daily active users.	Games and Big Data: A Scalable Multi-Dimensional Churn Prediction Model
1703.04691v3	We present a method for conditional time series forecasting based on the recent deep convolutional WaveNet architecture. The proposed network contains stacks of dilated convolutions that allow it to access a broad range of history when forecasting; multiple convolutional filters are applied in parallel to separate time series and allow for the fast processing of data and the exploitation of the correlation structure between the multivariate time series. The performance of the deep convolutional neural network is analyzed on various multivariate time series and compared to that of the well-known autoregressive model and a long-short term memory network. We show that our network is able to effectively learn dependencies between the series without the need for long historical time series and can outperform the baseline neural forecasting models.

1701.06749v1	Heavy-tailed distributions are widely used in robust mixture modelling due to possessing thick tails. As a computationally tractable subclass of the stable distributions, sub-Gaussian $\alpha$-stable distribution received much interest in the literature. Here, we introduce a type of expectation maximization algorithm that estimates parameters of a mixture of sub-Gaussian stable distributions. A comparative study, in the presence of some well-known mixture models, is performed to show the robustness and performance of the mixture of sub-Gaussian $\alpha$-stable distributions for modelling, simulated, synthetic, and real data.

1711.08936v2	We present Causal Generative Neural Networks (CGNNs) to learn functional causal models from observational data. CGNNs leverage conditional independencies and distributional asymmetries to discover bivariate and multivariate causal structures. CGNNs make no assumption regarding the lack of confounders, and learn a differentiable generative model of the data by using backpropagation. Extensive experiments show their good performances comparatively to the state of the art in observational causal discovery on both simulated and real data, with respect to cause-effect inference, v-structure identification, and multivariate causal discovery.

1503.06432v1	Multi-output Gaussian processes have received increasing attention during the last few years as a natural mechanism to extend the powerful flexibility of Gaussian processes to the setup of multiple output variables. The key point here is the ability to design kernel functions that allow exploiting the correlations between the outputs while fulfilling the positive definiteness requisite for the covariance function. Alternatives to construct these covariance functions are the linear model of coregionalization and process convolutions. Each of these methods demand the specification of the number of latent Gaussian process used to build the covariance function for the outputs. We propose in this paper, the use of an Indian Buffet process as a way to perform model selection over the number of latent Gaussian processes. This type of model is particularly important in the context of latent force models, where the latent forces are associated to physical quantities like protein profiles or latent forces in mechanical systems. We use variational inference to estimate posterior distributions over the variables involved, and show examples of the model performance over artificial data, a motion capture dataset, and a gene expression dataset.

1707.06366v1	Neyman-Scott is a classic example of an estimation problem with a partially-consistent posterior, for which standard estimation methods tend to produce inconsistent results. Past attempts to create consistent estimators for Neyman-Scott have led to ad-hoc solutions, to estimators that do not satisfy representation invariance, to restrictions over the choice of prior and more. We present a simple construction for a general-purpose Bayes estimator, invariant to representation, which satisfies consistency on Neyman-Scott over any non-degenerate prior. We argue that the good attributes of the estimator are due to its intrinsic properties, and generalise beyond Neyman-Scott as well.	RKL: a general, invariant Bayes solution for Neyman-Scott
1609.05057v2	Sparse subspace clustering (SSC) is an elegant approach for unsupervised segmentation if the data points of each cluster are located in linear subspaces. This model applies, for instance, in motion segmentation if some restrictions on the camera model hold. SSC requires that problems based on the $l_1$-norm are solved to infer which points belong to the same subspace. If these unknown subspaces are well-separated this algorithm is guaranteed to succeed. The algorithm rests upon the assumption that points on the same subspace are well spread. The question what happens if this condition is violated has not yet been investigated. In this work, the effect of particular distributions on the same subspace will be analyzed. It will be shown that SSC fails to infer correct labels if points on the same subspace fall into more than one cluster.	Unbiased Sparse Subspace Clustering By Selective Pursuit
1705.07348v2	In high-dimensional classification settings, we wish to seek a balance between high power and ensuring control over a desired loss function. In many settings, the points most likely to be misclassified are those who lie near the decision boundary of the given classification method. Often, these uninformative points should not be classified as they are noisy and do not exhibit strong signals. In this paper, we introduce the Thresholding Method to parameterize the problem of determining which points exhibit strong signals and should be classified. We demonstrate the empirical performance of this novel calibration method in providing loss function control at a desired level, as well as explore how the method assuages the effect of overfitting. We explore the benefits of error control through the Thresholding Method in difficult, high-dimensional, simulated settings. Finally, we show the flexibility of the Thresholding Method through applying the method in a variety of real data settings.	Calibrating Black Box Classification Models through the Thresholding  Method
0904.0838v2	Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate causal models in classical situations with fewer variables than observations (p<n, p: the number of variables and n: the number of observations). However, modern datasets including gene expression data need high-dimensional causal modeling in challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than observations (p>>n). In this paper, we propose a method to find exogenous variables in a linear non-Gaussian causal model, which requires much smaller sample sizes than conventional methods and works even when p>>n. The key idea is to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead of estimating the entire structure of the model. Exogenous variables work as triggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the causal mechanism. We present experiments with artificial data and real-world gene expression data to evaluate the method.	Finding Exogenous Variables in Data with Many More Variables than  Observations
1310.1519v2	The most important aspect of any classifier is its error rate, because this quantifies its predictive capacity. Thus, the accuracy of error estimation is critical. Error estimation is problematic in small-sample classifier design because the error must be estimated using the same data from which the classifier has been designed. Use of prior knowledge, in the form of a prior distribution on an uncertainty class of feature-label distributions to which the true, but unknown, feature-distribution belongs, can facilitate accurate error estimation (in the mean-square sense) in circumstances where accurate completely model-free error estimation is impossible. This paper provides analytic asymptotically exact finite-sample approximations for various performance metrics of the resulting Bayesian Minimum Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) error estimator in the case of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the multivariate Gaussian model. These performance metrics include the first, second, and cross moments of the Bayesian MMSE error estimator with the true error of LDA, and therefore, the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error of the estimator. We lay down the theoretical groundwork for Kolmogorov double-asymptotics in a Bayesian setting, which enables us to derive asymptotic expressions of the desired performance metrics. From these we produce analytic finite-sample approximations and demonstrate their accuracy via numerical examples. Various examples illustrate the behavior of these approximations and their use in determining the necessary sample size to achieve a desired RMS. The Supplementary Material contains derivations for some equations and added figures.	Moments and Root-Mean-Square Error of the Bayesian MMSE Estimator of  Classification Error in the Gaussian Model
0911.0054v2	The versatility of exponential families, along with their attendant convexity properties, make them a popular and effective statistical model. A central issue is learning these models in high-dimensions, such as when there is some sparsity pattern of the optimal parameter. This work characterizes a certain strong convexity property of general exponential families, which allow their generalization ability to be quantified. In particular, we show how this property can be used to analyze generic exponential families under L_1 regularization.	Learning Exponential Families in High-Dimensions: Strong Convexity and  Sparsity
0810.0901v2	Many problems of low-level computer vision and image processing, such as denoising, deconvolution, tomographic reconstruction or super-resolution, can be addressed by maximizing the posterior distribution of a sparse linear model (SLM). We show how higher-order Bayesian decision-making problems, such as optimizing image acquisition in magnetic resonance scanners, can be addressed by querying the SLM posterior covariance, unrelated to the density's mode. We propose a scalable algorithmic framework, with which SLM posteriors over full, high-resolution images can be approximated for the first time, solving a variational optimization problem which is convex iff posterior mode finding is convex. These methods successfully drive the optimization of sampling trajectories for real-world magnetic resonance imaging through Bayesian experimental design, which has not been attempted before. Our methodology provides new insight into similarities and differences between sparse reconstruction and approximate Bayesian inference, and has important implications for compressive sensing of real-world images.

1801.05772v1	We formulate a supervised learning problem, referred to as continuous ranking, where a continuous real-valued label Y is assigned to an observable r.v. X taking its values in a feature space $\mathcal{X}$ and the goal is to order all possible observations x in $\mathcal{X}$ by means of a scoring function $s:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ so that s(X) and Y tend to increase or decrease together with highest probability. This problem generalizes bi/multi-partite ranking to a certain extent and the task of finding optimal scoring functions s(x) can be naturally cast as optimization of a dedicated functional criterion, called the IROC curve here, or as maximization of the Kendall ${\tau}$ related to the pair (s(X), Y ). From the theoretical side, we describe the optimal elements of this problem and provide statistical guarantees for empirical Kendall ${\tau}$ maximization under appropriate conditions for the class of scoring function candidates. We also propose a recursive statistical learning algorithm tailored to empirical IROC curve optimization and producing a piecewise constant scoring function that is fully described by an oriented binary tree. Preliminary numerical experiments highlight the difference in nature between regression and continuous ranking and provide strong empirical evidence of the performance of empirical optimizers of the criteria proposed.

1312.4717v1	We are concerned with an approximation problem for a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix due to motivation from a class of nonlinear machine learning methods. We discuss an approximation approach that we call {matrix ridge approximation}. In particular, we define the matrix ridge approximation as an incomplete matrix factorization plus a ridge term. Moreover, we present probabilistic interpretations using a normal latent variable model and a Wishart model for this approximation approach. The idea behind the latent variable model in turn leads us to an efficient EM iterative method for handling the matrix ridge approximation problem. Finally, we illustrate the applications of the approximation approach in multivariate data analysis. Empirical studies in spectral clustering and Gaussian process regression show that the matrix ridge approximation with the EM iteration is potentially useful.

1404.1935v2	We address structured covariance estimation in elliptical distributions by assuming that the covariance is a priori known to belong to a given convex set, e.g., the set of Toeplitz or banded matrices. We consider the General Method of Moments (GMM) optimization applied to robust Tyler's scatter M-estimator subject to these convex constraints. Unfortunately, GMM turns out to be non-convex due to the objective. Instead, we propose a new COCA estimator - a convex relaxation which can be efficiently solved. We prove that the relaxation is tight in the unconstrained case for a finite number of samples, and in the constrained case asymptotically. We then illustrate the advantages of COCA in synthetic simulations with structured compound Gaussian distributions. In these examples, COCA outperforms competing methods such as Tyler's estimator and its projection onto the structure set.

1412.7638v1	Given $n$ i.i.d. observations of a random vector $(X,Z)$, where $X$ is a high-dimensional vector and $Z$ is a low-dimensional index variable, we study the problem of estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix $\Omega(z) = (E[(X-E[X \mid Z])(X-E[X \mid Z])^T \mid Z=z])^{-1}$ under the assumption that the set of non-zero elements is small and does not depend on the index variable. We develop a novel procedure that combines the ideas of the local constant smoothing and the group Lasso for estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix. A proximal iterative smoothing algorithm is used to solve the corresponding convex optimization problems. We prove that our procedure recovers the conditional independence assumptions of the distribution $X \mid Z$ with high probability. This result is established by developing a uniform deviation bound for the high-dimensional conditional covariance matrix from its population counterpart, which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we develop point-wise confidence intervals for individual elements of the conditional inverse covariance matrix. We perform extensive simulation studies, in which we demonstrate that our proposed procedure outperforms sensible competitors. We illustrate our proposal on a S&P 500 stock price data set.	Inference for Sparse Conditional Precision Matrices
1307.0323v1	The Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GP-LVM) is a non-linear probabilistic method of embedding a high dimensional dataset in terms low dimensional `latent' variables. In this paper we illustrate that maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the latent variables and hyperparameters can be used for model selection and hence we can determine the optimal number or latent variables and the most appropriate model. This is an alternative to the variational approaches developed recently and may be useful when we want to use a non-Gaussian prior or kernel functions that don't have automatic relevance determination (ARD) parameters. Using a second order expansion of the latent variable posterior we can marginalise the latent variables and obtain an estimate for the hyperparameter posterior. Secondly, we use the GP-LVM to integrate multiple data sources by simultaneously embedding them in terms of common latent variables. We present results from synthetic data to illustrate the successful detection and retrieval of low dimensional structure from high dimensional data. We demonstrate that the integration of multiple data sources leads to more robust performance. Finally, we show that when the data are used for binary classification tasks we can attain a significant gain in prediction accuracy when the low dimensional representation is used.	Dimensionality Detection and Integration of Multiple Data Sources via  the GP-LVM
1707.02780v1	We develop a model in which interactions between nodes of a dynamic network are counted by non homogeneous Poisson processes. In a block modelling perspective, nodes belong to hidden clusters (whose number is unknown) and the intensity functions of the counting processes only depend on the clusters of nodes. In order to make inference tractable we move to discrete time by partitioning the entire time horizon in which interactions are observed in fixed-length time sub-intervals. First, we derive an exact integrated classification likelihood criterion and maximize it relying on a greedy search approach. This allows to estimate the memberships to clusters and the number of clusters simultaneously. Then a maximum-likelihood estimator is developed to estimate non parametrically the integrated intensities. We discuss the over-fitting problems of the model and propose a regularized version solving these issues. Experiments on real and simulated data are carried out in order to assess the proposed methodology.	Block modelling in dynamic networks with non-homogeneous Poisson  processes and exact ICL

1712.03353v1	Performing inference over simulators is generally intractable as their runtime means we cannot compute a marginal likelihood. We develop a likelihood-free inference method to infer parameters for a cardiac simulator, which replicates electrical flow through the heart to the body surface. We improve the fit of a state-of-the-art simulator to an electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded from a real patient.

1112.3605v4	"A beta-negative binomial (BNB) process is proposed, leading to a beta-gamma-Poisson process, which may be viewed as a ""multi-scoop"" generalization of the beta-Bernoulli process. The BNB process is augmented into a beta-gamma-gamma-Poisson hierarchical structure, and applied as a nonparametric Bayesian prior for an infinite Poisson factor analysis model. A finite approximation for the beta process Levy random measure is constructed for convenient implementation. Efficient MCMC computations are performed with data augmentation and marginalization techniques. Encouraging results are shown on document count matrix factorization."

1407.7840v1	Matrix factorization (MF) has become a common approach to collaborative filtering, due to ease of implementation and scalability to large data sets. Two existing drawbacks of the basic model is that it does not incorporate side information on either users or items, and assumes a common variance for all users. We extend the work of constrained probabilistic matrix factorization by deriving the Gibbs updates for the side feature vectors for items (Salakhutdinov and Minh, 2008). We show that this Bayesian treatment to the constrained PMF model outperforms simple MAP estimation. We also consider extensions to heteroskedastic precision introduced in the literature (Lakshminarayanan, Bouchard, and Archambeau, 2011). We show that this tends result in overfitting for deterministic approximation algorithms (ex: Variational inference) when the observed entries in the user / item matrix are distributed in an non-uniform manner. In light of this, we propose a truncated precision model. Our experimental results suggest that this model tends to delay overfitting.

1105.0540v2	Nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are widely used in machine learning and data mining applications, and our aim is to better understand what they reveal about the cluster structure of the unknown underlying distribution of points. Moreover, is it possible to identify spurious structures that might arise due to sampling variability? Our first contribution is a statistical analysis that reveals how certain subgraphs of a k-NN graph form a consistent estimator of the cluster tree of the underlying distribution of points. Our second and perhaps most important contribution is the following finite sample guarantee. We carefully work out the tradeoff between aggressive and conservative pruning and are able to guarantee the removal of all spurious cluster structures at all levels of the tree while at the same time guaranteeing the recovery of salient clusters. This is the first such finite sample result in the context of clustering.	Pruning nearest neighbor cluster trees
1110.1757v2	Recently, Mahoney and Orecchia demonstrated that popular diffusion-based procedures to compute a quick \emph{approximation} to the first nontrivial eigenvector of a data graph Laplacian \emph{exactly} solve certain regularized Semi-Definite Programs (SDPs). In this paper, we extend that result by providing a statistical interpretation of their approximation procedure. Our interpretation will be analogous to the manner in which $\ell_2$-regularized or $\ell_1$-regularized $\ell_2$-regression (often called Ridge regression and Lasso regression, respectively) can be interpreted in terms of a Gaussian prior or a Laplace prior, respectively, on the coefficient vector of the regression problem. Our framework will imply that the solutions to the Mahoney-Orecchia regularized SDP can be interpreted as regularized estimates of the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian. Conversely, it will imply that the solution to this regularized estimation problem can be computed very quickly by running, e.g., the fast diffusion-based PageRank procedure for computing an approximation to the first nontrivial eigenvector of the graph Laplacian. Empirical results are also provided to illustrate the manner in which approximate eigenvector computation \emph{implicitly} performs statistical regularization, relative to running the corresponding exact algorithm.

1706.10272v1	We propose the nuclear norm penalty as an alternative to the ridge penalty for regularized multinomial regression. This convex relaxation of reduced-rank multinomial regression has the advantage of leveraging underlying structure among the response categories to make better predictions. We apply our method, nuclear penalized multinomial regression (NPMR), to Major League Baseball play-by-play data to predict outcome probabilities based on batter-pitcher matchups. The interpretation of the results meshes well with subject-area expertise and also suggests a novel understanding of what differentiates players.

1706.02412v1	We present a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) approach to outlier detection in a linear regression setting, where the closeness of probability distributions is measured using the Wasserstein metric. Training samples contaminated with outliers skew the regression plane computed by least squares and thus impede outlier detection. Classical approaches, such as robust regression, remedy this problem by downweighting the contribution of atypical data points. In contrast, our Wasserstein DRO approach hedges against a family of distributions that are close to the empirical distribution. We show that the resulting formulation encompasses a class of models, which include the regularized Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) as a special case. We provide new insights into the regularization term and give guidance on the selection of the regularization coefficient from the standpoint of a confidence region. We establish two types of performance guarantees for the solution to our formulation under mild conditions. One is related to its out-of-sample behavior, and the other concerns the discrepancy between the estimated and true regression planes. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach to both robust regression and the regularized LAD in terms of estimation accuracy and outlier detection rates.

1202.4050v2	The goal of predictive sparse coding is to learn a representation of examples as sparse linear combinations of elements from a dictionary, such that a learned hypothesis linear in the new representation performs well on a predictive task. Predictive sparse coding algorithms recently have demonstrated impressive performance on a variety of supervised tasks, but their generalization properties have not been studied. We establish the first generalization error bounds for predictive sparse coding, covering two settings: 1) the overcomplete setting, where the number of features k exceeds the original dimensionality d; and 2) the high or infinite-dimensional setting, where only dimension-free bounds are useful. Both learning bounds intimately depend on stability properties of the learned sparse encoder, as measured on the training sample. Consequently, we first present a fundamental stability result for the LASSO, a result characterizing the stability of the sparse codes with respect to perturbations to the dictionary. In the overcomplete setting, we present an estimation error bound that decays as \tilde{O}(sqrt(d k/m)) with respect to d and k. In the high or infinite-dimensional setting, we show a dimension-free bound that is \tilde{O}(sqrt(k^2 s / m)) with respect to k and s, where s is an upper bound on the number of non-zeros in the sparse code for any training data point.

1408.6693v1	"The FastICA algorithm is one of the most popular iterative algorithms in the domain of linear independent component analysis. Despite its success, it is observed that FastICA occasionally yields outcomes that do not correspond to any true solutions (known as demixing vectors) of the ICA problem. These outcomes are commonly referred to as spurious solutions. Although FastICA is among the most extensively studied ICA algorithms, the occurrence of spurious solutions are not yet completely understood by the community. In this contribution, we aim at addressing this issue. In the first part of this work, we are interested in the relationship between demixing vectors, local optimizers of the contrast function and (attractive or unattractive) fixed points of FastICA algorithm. Characterizations of these sets are given, and an inclusion relationship is discovered. In the second part, we investigate the possible scenarios where spurious solutions occur. We show that when certain bimodal Gaussian mixtures distributions are involved, there may exist spurious solutions that are attractive fixed points of FastICA. In this case, popular nonlinearities such as ""gauss"" or ""tanh"" tend to yield spurious solutions, whereas only ""kurtosis"" may give reliable results. Some advices are given for the practical choice of nonlinearity function."	A study of the fixed points and spurious solutions of the FastICA  algorithm
1305.7344v1	In systems biomedicine, an experimenter encounters different potential sources of variation in data such as individual samples, multiple experimental conditions, and multi-variable network-level responses. In multiparametric cytometry, which is often used for analyzing patient samples, such issues are critical. While computational methods can identify cell populations in individual samples, without the ability to automatically match them across samples, it is difficult to compare and characterize the populations in typical experiments, such as those responding to various stimulations or distinctive of particular patients or time-points, especially when there are many samples. Joint Clustering and Matching (JCM) is a multi-level framework for simultaneous modeling and registration of populations across a cohort. JCM models every population with a robust multivariate probability distribution. Simultaneously, JCM fits a random-effects model to construct an overall batch template -- used for registering populations across samples, and classifying new samples. By tackling systems-level variation, JCM supports practical biomedical applications involving large cohorts.

1602.06049v1	Dynamic topic models (DTMs) are very effective in discovering topics and capturing their evolution trends in time series data. To do posterior inference of DTMs, existing methods are all batch algorithms that scan the full dataset before each update of the model and make inexact variational approximations with mean-field assumptions. Due to a lack of a more scalable inference algorithm, despite the usefulness, DTMs have not captured large topic dynamics. This paper fills this research void, and presents a fast and parallelizable inference algorithm using Gibbs Sampling with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics that does not make any unwarranted assumptions. We also present a Metropolis-Hastings based $O(1)$ sampler for topic assignments for each word token. In a distributed environment, our algorithm requires very little communication between workers during sampling (almost embarrassingly parallel) and scales up to large-scale applications. We are able to learn the largest Dynamic Topic Model to our knowledge, and learned the dynamics of 1,000 topics from 2.6 million documents in less than half an hour, and our empirical results show that our algorithm is not only orders of magnitude faster than the baselines but also achieves lower perplexity.

1606.01822v3	"Rapid overlay of chemical structures (ROCS) is a standard tool for the calculation of 3D shape and chemical (""color"") similarity. ROCS uses unweighted sums to combine many aspects of similarity, yielding parameter-free models for virtual screening. In this report, we decompose the ROCS color force field into ""color components"" and ""color atom overlaps"", novel color similarity features that can be weighted in a system-specific manner by machine learning algorithms. In cross-validation experiments, these additional features significantly improve virtual screening performance (ROC AUC scores) relative to standard ROCS."	ROCS-Derived Features for Virtual Screening
1203.0683v3	Mixture models are a fundamental tool in applied statistics and machine learning for treating data taken from multiple subpopulations. The current practice for estimating the parameters of such models relies on local search heuristics (e.g., the EM algorithm) which are prone to failure, and existing consistent methods are unfavorable due to their high computational and sample complexity which typically scale exponentially with the number of mixture components. This work develops an efficient method of moments approach to parameter estimation for a broad class of high-dimensional mixture models with many components, including multi-view mixtures of Gaussians (such as mixtures of axis-aligned Gaussians) and hidden Markov models. The new method leads to rigorous unsupervised learning results for mixture models that were not achieved by previous works; and, because of its simplicity, it offers a viable alternative to EM for practical deployment.	A Method of Moments for Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models
1707.02050v1	We propose a K-sparse exhaustive search (ES-K) method and a K-sparse approximate exhaustive search method (AES-K) for selecting variables in linear regression. With these methods, K-sparse combinations of variables are tested exhaustively assuming that the optimal combination of explanatory variables is K-sparse. By collecting the results of exhaustively computing ES-K, various approximate methods for selecting sparse variables can be summarized as density of states. With this density of states, we can compare different methods for selecting sparse variables such as relaxation and sampling. For large problems where the combinatorial explosion of explanatory variables is crucial, the AES-K method enables density of states to be effectively reconstructed by using the replica-exchange Monte Carlo method and the multiple histogram method. Applying the ES-K and AES-K methods to type Ia supernova data, we confirmed the conventional understanding in astronomy when an appropriate K is given beforehand. However, we found the difficulty to determine K from the data. Using virtual measurement and analysis, we argue that this is caused by data shortage.

1608.00441v1	Nonlinear similarity measures defined in kernel space, such as correntropy, can extract higher-order statistics of data and offer potentially significant performance improvement over their linear counterparts especially in non-Gaussian signal processing and machine learning. In this work, we propose a new similarity measure in kernel space, called the kernel risk-sensitive loss (KRSL), and provide some important properties. We apply the KRSL to adaptive filtering and investigate the robustness, and then develop the MKRSL algorithm and analyze the mean square convergence performance. Compared with correntropy, the KRSL can offer a more efficient performance surface, thereby enabling a gradient based method to achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy while still maintaining the robustness to outliers. Theoretical analysis results and superior performance of the new algorithm are confirmed by simulation.

1008.0706v1	Computer generated academic papers have been used to expose a lack of thorough human review at several computer science conferences. We assess the problem of classifying such documents. After identifying and evaluating several quantifiable features of academic papers, we apply methods from machine learning to build a binary classifier. In tests with two hundred papers, the resulting classifier correctly labeled papers either as human written or as computer generated with no false classifications of computer generated papers as human and a 2% false classification rate for human papers as computer generated. We believe generalizations of these features are applicable to similar classification problems. While most current text-based spam detection techniques focus on the keyword-based classification of email messages, a new generation of unsolicited computer-generated advertisements masquerade as legitimate postings in online groups, message boards and social news sites. Our results show that taking the formatting and contextual clues offered by these environments into account may be of central importance when selecting features with which to identify such unwanted postings.	Algorithmic Detection of Computer Generated Text
1502.02843v3	To scale Gaussian processes (GPs) to large data sets we introduce the robust Bayesian Committee Machine (rBCM), a practical and scalable product-of-experts model for large-scale distributed GP regression. Unlike state-of-the-art sparse GP approximations, the rBCM is conceptually simple and does not rely on inducing or variational parameters. The key idea is to recursively distribute computations to independent computational units and, subsequently, recombine them to form an overall result. Efficient closed-form inference allows for straightforward parallelisation and distributed computations with a small memory footprint. The rBCM is independent of the computational graph and can be used on heterogeneous computing infrastructures, ranging from laptops to clusters. With sufficient computing resources our distributed GP model can handle arbitrarily large data sets.	Distributed Gaussian Processes
1706.03267v1	We consider maximum likelihood estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models (Gmms). This task is almost invariably solved (in theory and practice) via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. EM owes its success to various factors, of which is its ability to fulfill positive definiteness constraints in closed form is of key importance. We propose an alternative to EM by appealing to the rich Riemannian geometry of positive definite matrices, using which we cast Gmm parameter estimation as a Riemannian optimization problem. Surprisingly, such an out-of-the-box Riemannian formulation completely fails and proves much inferior to EM. This motivates us to take a closer look at the problem geometry, and derive a better formulation that is much more amenable to Riemannian optimization. We then develop (Riemannian) batch and stochastic gradient algorithms that outperform EM, often substantially. We provide a non-asymptotic convergence analysis for our stochastic method, which is also the first (to our knowledge) such global analysis for Riemannian stochastic gradient. Numerous empirical results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.	An Alternative to EM for Gaussian Mixture Models: Batch and Stochastic  Riemannian Optimization
0708.2377v1	We present and analyse three online algorithms for learning in discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and compare them with the Baldi-Chauvin Algorithm. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of generalisation error we draw learning curves in simplified situations. The performance for learning drifting concepts of one of the presented algorithms is analysed and compared with the Baldi-Chauvin algorithm in the same situations. A brief discussion about learning and symmetry breaking based on our results is also presented.	Online Learning in Discrete Hidden Markov Models
1702.03522v2	Spectral clustering is amongst the most popular methods for community detection in graphs. A key step in spectral clustering algorithms is the eigen-decomposition of the $n{\times}n$ graph Laplacian matrix to extract its $k$ leading eigenvectors, where $k$ is the desired number of clusters among $n$ objects. This is prohibitively complex to implement for very large datasets. However, it has recently been shown that it is possible to bypass the eigen-decomposition by computing an approximate spectral embedding through graph filtering of random signals. In this paper, we prove that spectral clustering performed via graph filtering can still recover the planted clusters consistently, under mild conditions. We analyse the effects of sparsity, dimensionality and filter approximation error on the consistency of the algorithm.	Spectral Clustering via Graph Filtering: Consistency on the  High-Dimensional Stochastic Block Model
1411.3972v4	"A widely applied approach to causal inference from a non-experimental time series $X$, often referred to as ""(linear) Granger causal analysis"", is to regress present on past and interpret the regression matrix $\hat{B}$ causally. However, if there is an unmeasured time series $Z$ that influences $X$, then this approach can lead to wrong causal conclusions, i.e., distinct from those one would draw if one had additional information such as $Z$. In this paper we take a different approach: We assume that $X$ together with some hidden $Z$ forms a first order vector autoregressive (VAR) process with transition matrix $A$, and argue why it is more valid to interpret $A$ causally instead of $\hat{B}$. Then we examine under which conditions the most important parts of $A$ are identifiable or almost identifiable from only $X$. Essentially, sufficient conditions are (1) non-Gaussian, independent noise or (2) no influence from $X$ to $Z$. We present two estimation algorithms that are tailored towards conditions (1) and (2), respectively, and evaluate them on synthetic and real-world data. We discuss how to check the model using $X$."

1102.4399v3	Multi-class classification methods based on both labeled and unlabeled functional data sets are discussed. We present a semi-supervised logistic model for classification in the context of functional data analysis. Unknown parameters in our proposed model are estimated by regularization with the help of EM algorithm. A crucial point in the modeling procedure is the choice of a regularization parameter involved in the semi-supervised functional logistic model. In order to select the adjusted parameter, we introduce model selection criteria from information-theoretic and Bayesian viewpoints. Monte Carlo simulations and a real data analysis are given to examine the effectiveness of our proposed modeling strategy.	Semi-supervised logistic discrimination for functional data
1709.09301v1	We propose a Bayesian regression method that accounts for multi-way interactions of arbitrary orders among the predictor variables. Our model makes use of a factorization mechanism for representing the regression coefficients of interactions among the predictors, while the interaction selection is guided by a prior distribution on random hypergraphs, a construction which generalizes the Finite Feature Model. We present a posterior inference algorithm based on Gibbs sampling, and establish posterior consistency of our regression model. Our method is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated data and demonstrated to be able to identify meaningful interactions in applications in genetics and retail demand forecasting.

1112.5215v1	Low-rank structure have been profoundly studied in data mining and machine learning. In this paper, we show a dense matrix $X$'s low-rank approximation can be rapidly built from its left and right random projections $Y_1=XA_1$ and $Y_2=X^TA_2$, or bilateral random projection (BRP). We then show power scheme can further improve the precision. The deterministic, average and deviation bounds of the proposed method and its power scheme modification are proved theoretically. The effectiveness and the efficiency of BRP based low-rank approximation is empirically verified on both artificial and real datasets.	Bilateral Random Projections
1609.00577v1	We develop an automated variational method for inference in models with Gaussian process (GP) priors and general likelihoods. The method supports multiple outputs and multiple latent functions and does not require detailed knowledge of the conditional likelihood, only needing its evaluation as a black-box function. Using a mixture of Gaussians as the variational distribution, we show that the evidence lower bound and its gradients can be estimated efficiently using empirical expectations over univariate Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, the method is scalable to large datasets which is achieved by using an augmented prior via the inducing-variable approach underpinning most sparse GP approximations, along with parallel computation and stochastic optimization. We evaluate our method with experiments on small datasets, medium-scale datasets and a large dataset, showing its competitiveness under different likelihood models and sparsity levels. Moreover, we analyze learning in our model under batch and stochastic settings, and study the effect of optimizing the inducing inputs. Finally, in the large-scale experiment, we investigate the problem of predicting airline delays and show that our method is on par with the state-of-the-art hard-coded approach for scalable GP regression.

1504.05006v2	Acyclic digraphs are the underlying representation of Bayesian networks, a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models. Learning the underlying graph from data is a way of gaining insights about the structural properties of a domain. Structure learning forms one of the inference challenges of statistical graphical models. MCMC methods, notably structure MCMC, to sample graphs from the posterior distribution given the data are probably the only viable option for Bayesian model averaging. Score modularity and restrictions on the number of parents of each node allow the graphs to be grouped into larger collections, which can be scored as a whole to improve the chain's convergence. Current examples of algorithms taking advantage of grouping are the biased order MCMC, which acts on the alternative space of permuted triangular matrices, and non ergodic edge reversal moves. Here we propose a novel algorithm, which employs the underlying combinatorial structure of DAGs to define a new grouping. As a result convergence is improved compared to structure MCMC, while still retaining the property of producing an unbiased sample. Finally the method can be combined with edge reversal moves to improve the sampler further.	Partition MCMC for inference on acyclic digraphs
1003.4741v1	The extension of the classical Bayesian penalized spline method to inference on vector-valued functions is considered, with an emphasis on characterizing the suitability of the method for general application.We show that the standard quadratic penalty is exactly analogous to the energy of a stretched string, with the penalty parameter corresponding to its tension. This physical analogy motivates a discussion of resolution independence, which we define as the convergence of a computational function estimate to arbitrary accuracy with increasing resolution.The multidimensional context makes direct application of standard procedures for choosing the penalty parameter difficult, and a new method is proposed and compared to the established generalized cross-validation (GCV) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) functions.Our Bayesian method for choosing this parameter is derived by introducing a scal e independence criterion to ensure that simultaneously scaling the function samples and their variances does not significantly change the posterior parameter distribution. Due to the possibility of an exact polynomial fit, numerical issues prevent the use of this prior, and a solution is presented based on adding a st ring zero-point energy. This makes more complicated approaches recently propose d in the literature unnecessary, and eliminates the requirement for sensitivity analysis when the function deviates from the above mentioned polynomial. An important class of problems which can be analyzed by this method are stochastic numerical integrators, which are considered as an example problem. This work represents the first extension of penalized spline methods to inference on multidimensional numerical integrators reported in the literature. Several numerical calculations illustrate the above points and address practical application issues.	Resolution and Scale Independent Function Matching Using a String Energy  Penalized Spline Prior
1612.05907v1	We propose a first data-driven tuning procedure for divide-and-conquer kernel ridge regression (Zhang et al., 2015). While the proposed criterion is computationally scalable for massive data sets, it is also shown to be asymptotically optimal under mild conditions. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated by extensive simulations and an application to Million Song Dataset.	Optimal tuning for divide-and-conquer kernel ridge regression with  massive data
1111.0352v2	Bayesian models offer great flexibility for clustering applications---Bayesian nonparametrics can be used for modeling infinite mixtures, and hierarchical Bayesian models can be utilized for sharing clusters across multiple data sets. For the most part, such flexibility is lacking in classical clustering methods such as k-means. In this paper, we revisit the k-means clustering algorithm from a Bayesian nonparametric viewpoint. Inspired by the asymptotic connection between k-means and mixtures of Gaussians, we show that a Gibbs sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet process mixture approaches a hard clustering algorithm in the limit, and further that the resulting algorithm monotonically minimizes an elegant underlying k-means-like clustering objective that includes a penalty for the number of clusters. We generalize this analysis to the case of clustering multiple data sets through a similar asymptotic argument with the hierarchical Dirichlet process. We also discuss further extensions that highlight the benefits of our analysis: i) a spectral relaxation involving thresholded eigenvectors, and ii) a normalized cut graph clustering algorithm that does not fix the number of clusters in the graph.	Revisiting k-means: New Algorithms via Bayesian Nonparametrics
1107.2021v3	In the supervised learning setting termed Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL), the examples are bags of instances, and the bag label is a function of the labels of its instances. Typically, this function is the Boolean OR. The learner observes a sample of bags and the bag labels, but not the instance labels that determine the bag labels. The learner is then required to emit a classification rule for bags based on the sample. MIL has numerous applications, and many heuristic algorithms have been used successfully on this problem, each adapted to specific settings or applications. In this work we provide a unified theoretical analysis for MIL, which holds for any underlying hypothesis class, regardless of a specific application or problem domain. We show that the sample complexity of MIL is only poly-logarithmically dependent on the size of the bag, for any underlying hypothesis class. In addition, we introduce a new PAC-learning algorithm for MIL, which uses a regular supervised learning algorithm as an oracle. We prove that efficient PAC-learning for MIL can be generated from any efficient non-MIL supervised learning algorithm that handles one-sided error. The computational complexity of the resulting algorithm is only polynomially dependent on the bag size.	Multi-Instance Learning with Any Hypothesis Class
1710.09508v1	Many matching, tracking, sorting, and ranking problems require probabilistic reasoning about possible permutations, a set that grows factorially with dimension. Combinatorial optimization algorithms may enable efficient point estimation, but fully Bayesian inference poses a severe challenge in this high-dimensional, discrete space. To surmount this challenge, we start with the usual step of relaxing a discrete set (here, of permutation matrices) to its convex hull, which here is the Birkhoff polytope: the set of all doubly-stochastic matrices. We then introduce two novel transformations: first, an invertible and differentiable stick-breaking procedure that maps unconstrained space to the Birkhoff polytope; second, a map that rounds points toward the vertices of the polytope. Both transformations include a temperature parameter that, in the limit, concentrates the densities on permutation matrices. We then exploit these transformations and reparameterization gradients to introduce variational inference over permutation matrices, and we demonstrate its utility in a series of experiments.	Reparameterizing the Birkhoff Polytope for Variational Permutation  Inference
1802.09086v1	We propose a multiresolution Gaussian process (GP) model which assumes conditional independence among GPs across resolutions. We characterize each GP using a particular representation of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion where each basis vector of the representation consists of an axis and a scale factor, referred to as the basis axis and the basis-axis scale. The basis axes have unique characteristics: They are zero-mean by construction and are on the unit sphere. The axes are modeled using Bingham distributions---a natural choice for modeling axial data. Given the axes, all GPs across resolutions are independent---this is in direct contrast to the common assumption of full independence between GPs. More specifically, all GPs are tied to the same set of axes but the basis-axis scales of each GP are specific to the resolution on which they are defined. Relaxing the full independence assumption helps in reducing overfitting which can be of a problem in an otherwise identical model architecture with full independence assumption. We consider a Bayesian treatment of the model using variational inference.	Conditionally Independent Multiresolution Gaussian Processes
1112.2738v1	We consider the problem of function estimation in the case where the data distribution may shift between training and test time, and additional information about it may be available at test time. This relates to popular scenarios such as covariate shift, concept drift, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning. This working paper discusses how these tasks could be tackled depending on the kind of changes of the distributions. It argues that knowledge of an underlying causal direction can facilitate several of these tasks.	Robust Learning via Cause-Effect Models
0707.4072v1	A conceptual framework for cluster analysis from the viewpoint of p-adic geometry is introduced by describing the space of all dendrograms for n datapoints and relating it to the moduli space of p-adic Riemannian spheres with punctures using a method recently applied by Murtagh (2004b). This method embeds a dendrogram as a subtree into the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the p-adic numbers, and goes back to Cornelissen et al. (2001) in p-adic geometry. After explaining the definitions, the concept of classifiers is discussed in the context of moduli spaces, and upper bounds for the number of hidden vertices in dendrograms are given.	Families of dendrograms
1409.7134v2	Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography are the only methods to measure the structure of the white matter in the living human brain. The diffusion signal has been modelled as the combined contribution from many individual fascicles of nerve fibers passing through each location in the white matter. Typically, this is done via basis pursuit, but estimation of the exact directions is limited due to discretization. The difficulties inherent in modeling DWI data are shared by many other problems involving fitting non-parametric mixture models. Ekanadaham et al. proposed an approach, continuous basis pursuit, to overcome discretization error in the 1-dimensional case (e.g., spike-sorting). Here, we propose a more general algorithm that fits mixture models of any dimensionality without discretization. Our algorithm uses the principles of L2-boost, together with refitting of the weights and pruning of the parameters. The addition of these steps to L2-boost both accelerates the algorithm and assures its accuracy. We refer to the resulting algorithm as elastic basis pursuit, or EBP, since it expands and contracts the active set of kernels as needed. We show that in contrast to existing approaches to fitting mixtures, our boosting framework (1) enables the selection of the optimal bias-variance tradeoff along the solution path, and (2) scales with high-dimensional problems. In simulations of DWI, we find that EBP yields better parameter estimates than a non-negative least squares (NNLS) approach, or the standard model used in DWI, the tensor model, which serves as the basis for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We demonstrate the utility of the method in DWI data acquired in parts of the brain containing crossings of multiple fascicles of nerve fibers.

1205.4217v2	The question of the optimality of Thompson Sampling for solving the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem had been open since 1933. In this paper we answer it positively for the case of Bernoulli rewards by providing the first finite-time analysis that matches the asymptotic rate given in the Lai and Robbins lower bound for the cumulative regret. The proof is accompanied by a numerical comparison with other optimal policies, experiments that have been lacking in the literature until now for the Bernoulli case.	Thompson Sampling: An Asymptotically Optimal Finite Time Analysis
1202.3702v1	We present a simple, yet effective, approach to Semi-Supervised Learning. Our approach is based on estimating density-based distances (DBD) using a shortest path calculation on a graph. These Graph-DBD estimates can then be used in any distance-based supervised learning method, such as Nearest Neighbor methods and SVMs with RBF kernels. In order to apply the method to very large data sets, we also present a novel algorithm which integrates nearest neighbor computations into the shortest path search and can find exact shortest paths even in extremely large dense graphs. Significant runtime improvement over the commonly used Laplacian regularization method is then shown on a large scale dataset.	Semi-supervised Learning with Density Based Distances
1202.3747v1	A database of objects discovered in houses in the Roman city of Pompeii provides a unique view of ordinary life in an ancient city. Experts have used this collection to study the structure of Roman households, exploring the distribution and variability of tasks in architectural spaces, but such approaches are necessarily affected by modern cultural assumptions. In this study we present a data-driven approach to household archeology, treating it as an unsupervised labeling problem. This approach scales to large data sets and provides a more objective complement to human interpretation.	Reconstructing Pompeian Households
1512.08673v1	"In compressed sensing, in order to recover a sparse or nearly sparse vector from possibly noisy measurements, the most popular approach is $\ell_1$-norm minimization. Upper bounds for the $\ell_2$- norm of the error between the true and estimated vectors are given in [1] and reviewed in [2], while bounds for the $\ell_1$-norm are given in [3]. When the unknown vector is not conventionally sparse but is ""group sparse"" instead, a variety of alternatives to the $\ell_1$-norm have been proposed in the literature, including the group LASSO, sparse group LASSO, and group LASSO with tree structured overlapping groups. However, no error bounds are available for any of these modified objective functions. In the present paper, a unified approach is presented for deriving upper bounds on the error between the true vector and its approximation, based on the notion of decomposable and $\gamma$-decomposable norms. The bounds presented cover all of the norms mentioned above, and also provide a guideline for choosing norms in future to accommodate alternate forms of sparsity."	Error Bounds for Compressed Sensing Algorithms With Group Sparsity: A  Unified Approach
1703.05841v1	This work addresses various open questions in the theory of active learning for nonparametric classification. Our contributions are both statistical and algorithmic: -We establish new minimax-rates for active learning under common \textit{noise conditions}. These rates display interesting transitions -- due to the interaction between noise \textit{smoothness and margin} -- not present in the passive setting. Some such transitions were previously conjectured, but remained unconfirmed. -We present a generic algorithmic strategy for adaptivity to unknown noise smoothness and margin; our strategy achieves optimal rates in many general situations; furthermore, unlike in previous work, we avoid the need for \textit{adaptive confidence sets}, resulting in strictly milder distributional requirements.	Adaptivity to Noise Parameters in Nonparametric Active Learning
1611.00817v1	We introduce a semi-parametric Bayesian model for survival analysis. The model is centred on a parametric baseline hazard, and uses a Gaussian process to model variations away from it nonparametrically, as well as dependence on covariates. As opposed to many other methods in survival analysis, our framework does not impose unnecessary constraints in the hazard rate or in the survival function. Furthermore, our model handles left, right and interval censoring mechanisms common in survival analysis. We propose a MCMC algorithm to perform inference and an approximation scheme based on random Fourier features to make computations faster. We report experimental results on synthetic and real data, showing that our model performs better than competing models such as Cox proportional hazards, ANOVA-DDP and random survival forests.	Gaussian Processes for Survival Analysis
1411.1690v2	Probabilistic programming languages can simplify the development of machine learning techniques, but only if inference is sufficiently scalable. Unfortunately, Bayesian parameter estimation for highly coupled models such as regressions and state-space models still scales poorly; each MCMC transition takes linear time in the number of observations. This paper describes a sublinear-time algorithm for making Metropolis-Hastings (MH) updates to latent variables in probabilistic programs. The approach generalizes recently introduced approximate MH techniques: instead of subsampling data items assumed to be independent, it subsamples edges in a dynamically constructed graphical model. It thus applies to a broader class of problems and interoperates with other general-purpose inference techniques. Empirical results, including confirmation of sublinear per-transition scaling, are presented for Bayesian logistic regression, nonlinear classification via joint Dirichlet process mixtures, and parameter estimation for stochastic volatility models (with state estimation via particle MCMC). All three applications use the same implementation, and each requires under 20 lines of probabilistic code.	Sublinear-Time Approximate MCMC Transitions for Probabilistic Programs
1006.1062v1	Many data are naturally modeled by an unobserved hierarchical structure. In this paper we propose a flexible nonparametric prior over unknown data hierarchies. The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes to allow for trees of unbounded width and depth, where data can live at any node and are infinitely exchangeable. One can view our model as providing infinite mixtures where the components have a dependency structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree. By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference and simulate from the posterior distribution on trees. We apply our method to hierarchical clustering of images and topic modeling of text data.	Tree-Structured Stick Breaking Processes for Hierarchical Data
1610.05392v3	We investigate the capabilities and limitations of Gaussian process models by jointly exploring three complementary directions: (i) scalable and statistically efficient inference; (ii) flexible kernels; and (iii) objective functions for hyperparameter learning alternative to the marginal likelihood. Our approach outperforms all previously reported GP methods on the standard MNIST dataset; performs comparatively to previous kernel-based methods using the RECTANGLES-IMAGE dataset; and breaks the 1% error-rate barrier in GP models using the MNIST8M dataset, showing along the way the scalability of our method at unprecedented scale for GP models (8 million observations) in classification problems. Overall, our approach represents a significant breakthrough in kernel methods and GP models, bridging the gap between deep learning approaches and kernel machines.

1705.08415v3	We study data-driven methods for community detection in graphs. This estimation problem is typically formulated in terms of the spectrum of certain operators, as well as via posterior inference under certain probabilistic graphical models. Focusing on random graph families such as the Stochastic Block Model, recent research has unified these two approaches, and identified both statistical and computational signal-to-noise detection thresholds. We embed the resulting class of algorithms within a generic family of graph neural networks and show that they can reach those detection thresholds in a purely data-driven manner, without access to the underlying generative models and with no parameter assumptions. The resulting model is also tested on real datasets, requiring less computational steps and performing significantly better than rigid parametric models.	Community Detection with Graph Neural Networks
1502.00916v1	Inference and learning of graphical models are both well-studied problems in statistics and machine learning that have found many applications in science and engineering. However, exact inference is intractable in general graphical models, which suggests the problem of seeking the best approximation to a collection of random variables within some tractable family of graphical models. In this paper, we focus on the class of planar Ising models, for which exact inference is tractable using techniques of statistical physics. Based on these techniques and recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate that set of correlations. We demonstrate our method in simulations and for the application of modeling senate voting records.	Learning Planar Ising Models
1311.6359v3	Given data sampled from a number of variables, one is often interested in the underlying causal relationships in the form of a directed acyclic graph. In the general case, without interventions on some of the variables it is only possible to identify the graph up to its Markov equivalence class. However, in some situations one can find the true causal graph just from observational data, for example in structural equation models with additive noise and nonlinear edge functions. Most current methods for achieving this rely on nonparametric independence tests. One of the problems there is that the null hypothesis is independence, which is what one would like to get evidence for. We take a different approach in our work by using a penalized likelihood as a score for model selection. This is practically feasible in many settings and has the advantage of yielding a natural ranking of the candidate models. When making smoothness assumptions on the probability density space, we prove consistency of the penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We also present empirical results for simulated scenarios and real two-dimensional data sets (cause-effect pairs) where we obtain similar results as other state-of-the-art methods.	Score-based Causal Learning in Additive Noise Models
1108.4324v3	In sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), Gaussian scale mixtures (GSMs) have been used to model sparsity-inducing priors that realize a class of concave penalty functions for the regression task in real-valued signal models. Motivated by the relative scarcity of formal tools for SBL in complex-valued models, this paper proposes a GSM model - the Bessel K model - that induces concave penalty functions for the estimation of complex sparse signals. The properties of the Bessel K model are analyzed when it is applied to Type I and Type II estimation. This analysis reveals that, by tuning the parameters of the mixing pdf different penalty functions are invoked depending on the estimation type used, the value of the noise variance, and whether real or complex signals are estimated. Using the Bessel K model, we derive a sparse estimator based on a modification of the expectation-maximization algorithm formulated for Type II estimation. The estimator includes as a special instance the algorithms proposed by Tipping and Faul [1] and by Babacan et al. [2]. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed estimator over these state-of-the-art estimators in terms of convergence speed, sparseness, reconstruction error, and robustness in low and medium signal-to-noise ratio regimes.	Sparse Estimation using Bayesian Hierarchical Prior Modeling for Real  and Complex Linear Models
1211.7120v1	Nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process are an elegant alternative to finite models when the number of underlying components is unknown, but inference in such models can be slow. Existing attempts to parallelize inference in such models have relied on introducing approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the posterior estimate. In this paper, we describe auxiliary variable representations for the Dirichlet process and the hierarchical Dirichlet process that allow us to sample from the true posterior in a distributed manner. We show that our approach allows scalable inference without the deterioration in estimate quality that accompanies existing methods.	Exact and Efficient Parallel Inference for Nonparametric Mixture Models
1310.6778v2	We consider learning the possible causal direction of two observed variables in the presence of latent confounding variables. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate causal direction assuming linear or some type of nonlinear relationship and no latent confounders. However, the estimation results could be distorted if either assumption is actually violated. In this paper, we first propose a new linear non-Gaussian acyclic structural equation model with individual-specific effects that allows latent confounders to be considered. We then propose an empirical Bayesian approach for estimating possible causal direction using the new model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial and real-world data.

0912.3604v2	We provide yet another proof of the existence of calibrated forecasters; it has two merits. First, it is valid for an arbitrary finite number of outcomes. Second, it is short and simple and it follows from a direct application of Blackwell's approachability theorem to carefully chosen vector-valued payoff function and convex target set. Our proof captures the essence of existing proofs based on approachability (e.g., the proof by Foster, 1999 in case of binary outcomes) and highlights the intrinsic connection between approachability and calibration.	A Geometric Proof of Calibration
1006.1138v3	We consider the problem of sequential prediction and provide tools to study the minimax value of the associated game. Classical statistical learning theory provides several useful complexity measures to study learning with i.i.d. data. Our proposed sequential complexities can be seen as extensions of these measures to the sequential setting. The developed theory is shown to yield precise learning guarantees for the problem of sequential prediction. In particular, we show necessary and sufficient conditions for online learnability in the setting of supervised learning. Several examples show the utility of our framework: we can establish learnability without having to exhibit an explicit online learning algorithm.	Online Learning via Sequential Complexities
1404.2007v1	We describe a simple, efficient, permutation based procedure for selecting the penalty parameter in the LASSO. The procedure, which is intended for applications where variable selection is the primary focus, can be applied in a variety of structural settings, including generalized linear models. We briefly discuss connections between permutation selection and existing theory for the LASSO. In addition, we present a simulation study and an analysis of three real data sets in which permutation selection is compared with cross-validation (CV), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and a selection method based on recently developed testing procedures for the LASSO.	A Permutation Approach for Selecting the Penalty Parameter in Penalized  Model Selection
1708.00122v1	Disease classification is a crucial element of biomedical research. Recent studies have demonstrated that machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) modeling, produce similar or improved predictive capabilities in comparison to the traditional method of Logistic Regression. In addition, it has been found that social network metrics can provide useful predictive information for disease modeling. In this study, we combine simulated social network metrics with SVM to predict diabetes in a sample of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. In this dataset, Logistic Regression outperformed SVM with ROC index of 81.8 and 81.7 for models with and without graph metrics, respectively. SVM with a polynomial kernel had ROC index of 72.9 and 75.6 for models with and without graph metrics, respectively. Although this did not perform as well as Logistic Regression, the results are consistent with previous studies utilizing SVM to classify diabetes.	Application of Support Vector Machine Modeling and Graph Theory Metrics  for Disease Classification
1608.06622v2	The Kalman filter (KF) is used in a variety of applications for computing the posterior distribution of latent states in a state space model. The model requires a linear relationship between states and observations. Extensions to the Kalman filter have been proposed that incorporate linear approximations to nonlinear models, such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). However, we argue that in cases where the dimensionality of observed variables greatly exceeds the dimensionality of state variables, a model for $p(\text{state}|\text{observation})$ proves both easier to learn and more accurate for latent space estimation. We derive and validate what we call the discriminative Kalman filter (DKF): a closed-form discriminative version of Bayesian filtering that readily incorporates off-the-shelf discriminative learning techniques. Further, we demonstrate that given mild assumptions, highly non-linear models for $p(\text{state}|\text{observation})$ can be specified. We motivate and validate on synthetic datasets and in neural decoding from non-human primates, showing substantial increases in decoding performance versus the standard Kalman filter.

1109.0730v1	The performance of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) for variable selection is analyzed for random designs. When contrasted with the deterministic case, since the performance is here measured after averaging over the distribution of the design matrix, one can have far less stringent sparsity constraints on the coefficient vector. We demonstrate that for exact sparse vectors, the performance of the OMP is similar to known results on the Lasso algorithm [\textit{IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory} \textbf{55} (2009) 2183--2202]. Moreover, variable selection under a more relaxed sparsity assumption on the coefficient vector, whereby one has only control on the $\ell_1$ norm of the smaller coefficients, is also analyzed. As a consequence of these results, we also show that the coefficient estimate satisfies strong oracle type inequalities.

1103.6119v1	"In this paper, auto-associative models are proposed as candidates to the generalization of Principal Component Analysis. We show that these models are dedicated to the approximation of the dataset by a manifold. Here, the word ""manifold"" refers to the topology properties of the structure. The approximating manifold is built by a projection pursuit algorithm. At each step of the algorithm, the dimension of the manifold is incremented. Some theoretical properties are provided. In particular, we can show that, at each step of the algorithm, the mean residuals norm is not increased. Moreover, it is also established that the algorithm converges in a finite number of steps. Some particular auto-associative models are exhibited and compared to the classical PCA and some neural networks models. Implementation aspects are discussed. We show that, in numerous cases, no optimization procedure is required. Some illustrations on simulated and real data are presented."

1411.6203v1	Several problems such as network intrusion, community detection, and disease outbreak can be described by observations attributed to nodes or edges of a graph. In these applications presence of intrusion, community or disease outbreak is characterized by novel observations on some unknown connected subgraph. These problems can be formulated in terms of optimization of suitable objectives on connected subgraphs, a problem which is generally computationally difficult. We overcome the combinatorics of connectivity by embedding connected subgraphs into linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Computationally efficient tests are then realized by optimizing convex objective functions subject to these LMI constraints. We prove, by means of a novel Euclidean embedding argument, that our tests are minimax optimal for exponential family of distributions on 1-D and 2-D lattices. We show that internal conductance of the connected subgraph family plays a fundamental role in characterizing detectability.	Efficient Minimax Signal Detection on Graphs
1609.04289v1	We develop an automated variational inference method for Bayesian structured prediction problems with Gaussian process (GP) priors and linear-chain likelihoods. Our approach does not need to know the details of the structured likelihood model and can scale up to a large number of observations. Furthermore, we show that the required expected likelihood term and its gradients in the variational objective (ELBO) can be estimated efficiently by using expectations over very low-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Optimization of the ELBO is fully parallelizable over sequences and amenable to stochastic optimization, which we use along with control variate techniques and state-of-the-art incremental optimization to make our framework useful in practice. Results on a set of natural language processing tasks show that our method can be as good as (and sometimes better than) hard-coded approaches including SVM-struct and CRFs, and overcomes the scalability limitations of previous inference algorithms based on sampling. Overall, this is a fundamental step to developing automated inference methods for Bayesian structured prediction.	Gray-box inference for structured Gaussian process models
1010.0535v3	In nonparametric classification and regression problems, regularized kernel methods, in particular support vector machines, attract much attention in theoretical and in applied statistics. In an abstract sense, regularized kernel methods (simply called SVMs here) can be seen as regularized M-estimators for a parameter in a (typically infinite dimensional) reproducing kernel Hilbert space. For smooth loss functions, it is shown that the difference between the estimator, i.e.\ the empirical SVM, and the theoretical SVM is asymptotically normal with rate $\sqrt{n}$. That is, the standardized difference converges weakly to a Gaussian process in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. As common in real applications, the choice of the regularization parameter may depend on the data. The proof is done by an application of the functional delta-method and by showing that the SVM-functional is suitably Hadamard-differentiable.

1503.08356v4	Low-rank representation~(LRR) has been a significant method for segmenting data that are generated from a union of subspaces. It is, however, known that solving the LRR program is challenging in terms of time complexity and memory footprint, in that the size of the nuclear norm regularized matrix is $n$-by-$n$ (where $n$ is the number of samples). In this paper, we thereby develop a fast online implementation of LRR that reduces the memory cost from $O(n^2)$ to $O(pd)$, with $p$ being the ambient dimension and $d$ being some estimated rank~($d < p \ll n$). The crux for this end is a non-convex reformulation of the LRR program, which pursues the basis dictionary that generates the (uncorrupted) observations. We build the theoretical guarantee that the sequence of the solutions produced by our algorithm converges to a stationary point of the empirical and the expected loss function asymptotically. Extensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets further substantiate that our algorithm is fast, robust and memory efficient.	Efficient Online Minimization for Low-Rank Subspace Clustering
1402.2499v1	Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI) is a new approach to distinguish between cause and effect for two variables. It is based on an independence assumption between input distribution and causal mechanism that can be phrased in terms of orthogonality in information space. We describe two intuitive reinterpretations of this approach that makes IGCI more accessible to a broader audience. Moreover, we show that the described independence is related to the hypothesis that unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning only works for predicting the cause from the effect and not vice versa.	Justifying Information-Geometric Causal Inference
1711.00083v1	Many decisions in healthcare, business, and other policy domains are made without the support of rigorous evidence due to the cost and complexity of performing randomized experiments. Using observational data to answer causal questions is risky: subjects who receive different treatments also differ in other ways that affect outcomes. Many causal inference methods have been developed to mitigate these biases. However, there is no way to know which method might produce the best estimate of a treatment effect in a given study. In analogy to cross-validation, which estimates the prediction error of predictive models applied to a given dataset, we propose synth-validation, a procedure that estimates the estimation error of causal inference methods applied to a given dataset. In synth-validation, we use the observed data to estimate generative distributions with known treatment effects. We apply each causal inference method to datasets sampled from these distributions and compare the effect estimates with the known effects to estimate error. Using simulations, we show that using synth-validation to select a causal inference method for each study lowers the expected estimation error relative to consistently using any single method.	Synth-Validation: Selecting the Best Causal Inference Method for a Given  Dataset
1801.09819v3	The fundamental task of general density estimation $p(x)$ has been of keen interest to machine learning. In this work, we attempt to systematically characterize methods for density estimation. Broadly speaking, most of the existing methods can be categorized into either using: \textit{a}) autoregressive models to estimate the conditional factors of the chain rule, $p(x_{i}\, |\, x_{i-1}, \ldots)$; or \textit{b}) non-linear transformations of variables of a simple base distribution. Based on the study of the characteristics of these categories, we propose multiple novel methods for each category. For example we proposed RNN based transformations to model non-Markovian dependencies. Further, through a comprehensive study over both real world and synthetic data, we show for that jointly leveraging transformations of variables and autoregressive conditional models, results in a considerable improvement in performance. We illustrate the use of our models in outlier detection and image modeling. Finally we introduce a novel data driven framework for learning a family of distributions.	Transformation Autoregressive Networks
1707.01711v2	Modes and ridges of the probability density function behind observed data are useful geometric features. Mode-seeking clustering assigns cluster labels by associating data samples with the nearest modes, and estimation of density ridges enables us to find lower-dimensional structures hidden in data. A key technical challenge both in mode-seeking clustering and density ridge estimation is accurate estimation of the ratios of the first- and second-order density derivatives to the density. A naive approach takes a three-step approach of first estimating the data density, then computing its derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good density derivative estimator, and division by the estimated density could significantly magnify the estimation error. To cope with these problems, we propose a novel estimator for the \emph{density-derivative-ratios}. The proposed estimator does not involve density estimation, but rather \emph{directly} approximates the ratios of density derivatives of any order. Moreover, we establish a convergence rate of the proposed estimator. Based on the proposed estimator, new methods both for mode-seeking clustering and density ridge estimation are developed, and corresponding convergence rates to the mode and ridge of the underlying density are also established. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that the developed methods significantly outperform existing methods, particularly for relatively high-dimensional data.	Mode-Seeking Clustering and Density Ridge Estimation via Direct  Estimation of Density-Derivative-Ratios
1203.3492v1	We provide a simple method and relevant theoretical analysis for efficiently estimating higher-order lp distances. While the analysis mainly focuses on l4, our methodology extends naturally to p = 6,8,10..., (i.e., when p is even). Distance-based methods are popular in machine learning. In large-scale applications, storing, computing, and retrieving the distances can be both space and time prohibitive. Efficient algorithms exist for estimating lp distances if 0 < p <= 2. The task for p > 2 is known to be difficult. Our work partially fills this gap.	Approximating Higher-Order Distances Using Random Projections
1705.08716v1	The volume of data generated by internet and social networks is increasing every day, and there is a clear need for efficient ways of extracting useful information from them. As those data can take different forms, it is important to use all the available data representations for prediction. In this paper, we focus our attention on supervised classification using both regular plain, tabular, data and structural information coming from a network structure. 14 techniques are investigated and compared in this study and can be divided in three classes: the first one uses only the plain data to build a classification model, the second uses only the graph structure and the last uses both information sources. The relative performances in these three cases are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of using a graph embedding and well-known indicators in spatial statistics is also studied. Possible applications are automatic classification of web pages or other linked documents, of people in a social network or of proteins in a biological complex system, to name a few. Based on our comparison, we draw some general conclusions and advices to tackle this particular classification task: some datasets can be better explained by their graph structure (graph-driven), or by their feature set (features-driven). The most efficient methods are discussed in both cases.	An experimental study of graph-based semi-supervised classification with  additional node information
1703.01541v2	We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines. Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense.

1601.07665v1	Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is aimed at identifying a linear subspace such that the projected data follows a non-Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel NGCA algorithm based on log-density gradient estimation. Unlike existing methods, the proposed NGCA algorithm identifies the linear subspace by using the eigenvalue decomposition without any iterative procedures, and thus is computationally reasonable. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we prove that the identified subspace converges to the true subspace at the optimal parametric rate. Finally, the practical performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on both artificial and benchmark datasets.	Non-Gaussian Component Analysis with Log-Density Gradient Estimation
1409.4141v2	Network metrics form a fundamental part of the network analysis toolbox. Used to quantitatively measure different aspects of the network, these metrics can give insights into the underlying network structure and function. In this work, we connect network metrics to modern probabilistic machine learning. We focus on the centrality metric, which is used a wide variety of applications from web search to gene-analysis. First, we formulate an eigenvector-based Bayesian centrality model for determining node importance. Compared to existing methods, our probabilistic model allows for the assimilation of multiple edge weight observations, the inclusion of priors and the extraction of uncertainties. To enable tractable inference, we develop a variational lower bound (VBC) that is demonstrated to be effective on a variety of networks (two synthetic and five real-world graphs). We then bridge this model to sparse Gaussian processes. The sparse variational Bayesian centrality Gaussian process (VBC-GP) learns a mapping between node attributes to latent centrality and hence, is capable of predicting centralities from node features and can potentially represent a large number of nodes using only a limited number of inducing inputs. Experiments show that the VBC-GP learns high-quality mappings and compares favorably to a two-step baseline, i.e., a full GP trained on the node attributes and pre-computed centralities. Finally, we present two case-studies using the VBC-GP: first, to ascertain relevant features in a taxi transport network and second, to distribute a limited number of vaccines to mitigate the severity of a viral outbreak.

1610.08623v3	Despite the fundamental nature of the inhomogeneous Poisson process in the theory and application of stochastic processes, and its attractive generalizations (e.g. Cox process), few tractable nonparametric modeling approaches of intensity functions exist, especially when observed points lie in a high-dimensional space. In this paper we develop a new, computationally tractable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) formulation for the inhomogeneous Poisson process. We model the square root of the intensity as an RKHS function. Whereas RKHS models used in supervised learning rely on the so-called representer theorem, the form of the inhomogeneous Poisson process likelihood means that the representer theorem does not apply. However, we prove that the representer theorem does hold in an appropriately transformed RKHS, guaranteeing that the optimization of the penalized likelihood can be cast as a tractable finite-dimensional problem. The resulting approach is simple to implement, and readily scales to high dimensions and large-scale datasets.	Poisson intensity estimation with reproducing kernels
1506.02564v2	We propose Kernel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (KMC), a gradient-free adaptive MCMC algorithm based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). On target densities where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC adaptively learns the target's gradient structure by fitting an exponential family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free samplers. We support our claims with experimental studies on both toy and real-world applications, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and exact-approximate MCMC.

1303.2517v1	The concept of refinement from probability elicitation is considered for proper scoring rules. Taking directions from the axioms of probability, refinement is further clarified using a Hilbert space interpretation and reformulated into the underlying data distribution setting where connections to maximal marginal diversity and conditional entropy are considered and used to derive measures that provide arbitrarily tight bounds on the Bayes error. Refinement is also reformulated into the classifier output setting and its connections to calibrated classifiers and proper margin losses are established.

1702.01125v1	This paper presents a novel data-driven technique based on the spatiotemporal pattern network (STPN) for energy/power prediction for complex dynamical systems. Built on symbolic dynamic filtering, the STPN framework is used to capture not only the individual system characteristics but also the pair-wise causal dependencies among different sub-systems. For quantifying the causal dependency, a mutual information based metric is presented. An energy prediction approach is subsequently proposed based on the STPN framework. For validating the proposed scheme, two case studies are presented, one involving wind turbine power prediction (supply side energy) using the Western Wind Integration data set generated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics, and the other, residential electric energy disaggregation (demand side energy) using the Building America 2010 data set from NREL for exploring the temporal features. In the energy disaggregation context, convex programming techniques beyond the STPN framework are developed and applied to achieve improved disaggregation performance.

1709.01233v5	"Classifying samples into categories becomes intractable when a single sample can have millions to billions of features, such as in genetics or imaging data. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is widely used to identify a low-dimensional representation of such features for further analysis. However, PCA ignores class labels, such as whether or not a subject has cancer, thereby discarding information that could substantially improve downstream classification performance. We describe an approach, ""Linear Optimal Low-rank"" projection (LOL), which extends PCA by incorporating the class labels in a fashion that is advantageous over existing supervised dimensionality reduction techniques. We prove, and substantiate with synthetic experiments, that LOL leads to a better representation of the data for subsequent classification than other linear approaches, while adding negligible computational cost. We then demonstrate that LOL substantially outperforms PCA in differentiating cancer patients from healthy controls using genetic data, and in differentiating gender using magnetic resonance imaging data with $>$500 million features and 400 gigabytes of data. LOL therefore allows the solution of previous intractable problems, yet requires only a few minutes to run on a desktop computer."

1606.02518v3	"The multivariate normal density is a monotonic function of the distance to the mean, and its ellipsoidal shape is due to the underlying Euclidean metric. We suggest to replace this metric with a locally adaptive, smoothly changing (Riemannian) metric that favors regions of high local density. The resulting locally adaptive normal distribution (LAND) is a generalization of the normal distribution to the ""manifold"" setting, where data is assumed to lie near a potentially low-dimensional manifold embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$. The LAND is parametric, depending only on a mean and a covariance, and is the maximum entropy distribution under the given metric. The underlying metric is, however, non-parametric. We develop a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer the distribution parameters that relies on a combination of gradient descent and Monte Carlo integration. We further extend the LAND to mixture models, and provide the corresponding EM algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of the LAND to fit non-trivial probability distributions over both synthetic data, and EEG measurements of human sleep."	A Locally Adaptive Normal Distribution
1203.2570v1	"Differential privacy is a framework for privately releasing summaries of a database. Previous work has focused mainly on methods for which the output is a finite dimensional vector, or an element of some discrete set. We develop methods for releasing functions while preserving differential privacy. Specifically, we show that adding an appropriate Gaussian process to the function of interest yields differential privacy. When the functions lie in the same RKHS as the Gaussian process, then the correct noise level is established by measuring the ""sensitivity"" of the function in the RKHS norm. As examples we consider kernel density estimation, kernel support vector machines, and functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces."	Differential Privacy for Functions and Functional Data
1609.00285v4	Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, that are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). However, these methods don't exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks was proposed in \cite{Gregor10}, coined LISTA, which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately. In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.	Understanding Trainable Sparse Coding via Matrix Factorization
1006.3316v1	A challenging problem in estimating high-dimensional graphical models is to choose the regularization parameter in a data-dependent way. The standard techniques include $K$-fold cross-validation ($K$-CV), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Though these methods work well for low-dimensional problems, they are not suitable in high dimensional settings. In this paper, we present StARS: a new stability-based method for choosing the regularization parameter in high dimensional inference for undirected graphs. The method has a clear interpretation: we use the least amount of regularization that simultaneously makes a graph sparse and replicable under random sampling. This interpretation requires essentially no conditions. Under mild conditions, we show that StARS is partially sparsistent in terms of graph estimation: i.e. with high probability, all the true edges will be included in the selected model even when the graph size diverges with the sample size. Empirically, the performance of StARS is compared with the state-of-the-art model selection procedures, including $K$-CV, AIC, and BIC, on both synthetic data and a real microarray dataset. StARS outperforms all these competing procedures.	Stability Approach to Regularization Selection (StARS) for High  Dimensional Graphical Models
1010.0556v2	"We study the problem of learning a sparse linear regression vector under additional conditions on the structure of its sparsity pattern. This problem is relevant in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. It is well known that a linear regression can benefit from knowledge that the underlying regression vector is sparse. The combinatorial problem of selecting the nonzero components of this vector can be ""relaxed"" by regularizing the squared error with a convex penalty function like the $\ell_1$ norm. However, in many applications, additional conditions on the structure of the regression vector and its sparsity pattern are available. Incorporating this information into the learning method may lead to a significant decrease of the estimation error. In this paper, we present a family of convex penalty functions, which encode prior knowledge on the structure of the vector formed by the absolute values of the regression coefficients. This family subsumes the $\ell_1$ norm and is flexible enough to include different models of sparsity patterns, which are of practical and theoretical importance. We establish the basic properties of these penalty functions and discuss some examples where they can be computed explicitly. Moreover, we present a convergent optimization algorithm for solving regularized least squares with these penalty functions. Numerical simulations highlight the benefit of structured sparsity and the advantage offered by our approach over the Lasso method and other related methods."	Regularizers for Structured Sparsity
1509.02357v1	We study in this paper the consequences of using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of quality for regression models. We show that finding the best model under the MAPE is equivalent to doing weighted Mean Absolute Error (MAE) regression. We also show that, under some asumptions, universal consistency of Empirical Risk Minimization remains possible using the MAPE.

1202.5598v4	We suggest using the max-norm as a convex surrogate constraint for clustering.

1711.00382v3	This article carries out a large dimensional analysis of standard regularized discriminant analysis classifiers designed on the assumption that data arise from a Gaussian mixture model with different means and covariances. The analysis relies on fundamental results from random matrix theory (RMT) when both the number of features and the cardinality of the training data within each class grow large at the same pace. Under mild assumptions, we show that the asymptotic classification error approaches a deterministic quantity that depends only on the means and covariances associated with each class as well as the problem dimensions. Such a result permits a better understanding of the performance of regularized discriminant analsysis, in practical large but finite dimensions, and can be used to determine and pre-estimate the optimal regularization parameter that minimizes the misclassification error probability. Despite being theoretically valid only for Gaussian data, our findings are shown to yield a high accuracy in predicting the performances achieved with real data sets drawn from the popular USPS data base, thereby making an interesting connection between theory and practice.

1610.06902v1	We present a sparse estimation and dictionary learning framework for compressed fiber sensing based on a probabilistic hierarchical sparse model. To handle severe dictionary coherence, selective shrinkage is achieved using a Weibull prior, which can be related to non-convex optimization with $p$-norm constraints for $0 < p < 1$. In addition, we leverage the specific dictionary structure to promote collective shrinkage based on a local similarity model. This is incorporated in form of a kernel function in the joint prior density of the sparse coefficients, thereby establishing a Markov random field-relation. Approximate inference is accomplished using a hybrid technique that combines Hamilton Monte Carlo and Gibbs sampling. To estimate the dictionary parameter, we pursue two strategies, relying on either a deterministic or a probabilistic model for the dictionary parameter. In the first strategy, the parameter is estimated based on alternating estimation. In the second strategy, it is jointly estimated along with the sparse coefficients. The performance is evaluated in comparison to an existing method in various scenarios using simulations and experimental data.

1610.07104v1	Independent component analysis (ICA) is the most popular method for blind source separation (BSS) with a diverse set of applications, such as biomedical signal processing, video and image analysis, and communications. Maximum likelihood (ML), an optimal theoretical framework for ICA, requires knowledge of the true underlying probability density function (PDF) of the latent sources, which, in many applications, is unknown. ICA algorithms cast in the ML framework often deviate from its theoretical optimality properties due to poor estimation of the source PDF. Therefore, accurate estimation of source PDFs is critical in order to avoid model mismatch and poor ICA performance. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient ICA algorithm based on entropy maximization with kernels, (ICA-EMK), which uses both global and local measuring functions as constraints to dynamically estimate the PDF of the sources with reasonable complexity. In addition, the new algorithm performs optimization with respect to each of the cost function gradient directions separately, enabling parallel implementations on multi-core computers. We demonstrate the superior performance of ICA-EMK over competing ICA algorithms using simulated as well as real-world data.	Independent Component Analysis by Entropy Maximization with Kernels
1702.01414v1	Consumer Demand Response (DR) is an important research and industry problem, which seeks to categorize, predict and modify consumer's energy consumption. Unfortunately, traditional clustering methods have resulted in many hundreds of clusters, with a given consumer often associated with several clusters, making it difficult to classify consumers into stable representative groups and to predict individual energy consumption patterns. In this paper, we present a shape-based approach that better classifies and predicts consumer energy consumption behavior at the household level. The method is based on Dynamic Time Warping. DTW seeks an optimal alignment between energy consumption patterns reflecting the effect of hidden patterns of regular consumer behavior. Using real consumer 24-hour load curves from Opower Corporation, our method results in a 50% reduction in the number of representative groups and an improvement in prediction accuracy measured under DTW distance. We extend the approach to estimate which electrical devices will be used and in which hours.	Shape-Based Approach to Household Load Curve Clustering and Prediction
1704.01382v1	It has recently been shown that many of the existing quasi-Newton algorithms can be formulated as learning algorithms, capable of learning local models of the cost functions. Importantly, this understanding allows us to safely start assembling probabilistic Newton-type algorithms, applicable in situations where we only have access to noisy observations of the cost function and its derivatives. This is where our interest lies. We make contributions to the use of the non-parametric and probabilistic Gaussian process models in solving these stochastic optimisation problems. Specifically, we present a new algorithm that unites these approximations together with recent probabilistic line search routines to deliver a probabilistic quasi-Newton approach. We also show that the probabilistic optimisation algorithms deliver promising results on challenging nonlinear system identification problems where the very nature of the problem is such that we can only access the cost function and its derivative via noisy observations, since there are no closed-form expressions available.

1406.0071v1	Bayesian mixture models are widely applied for unsupervised learning and exploratory data analysis. Markov chain Monte Carlo based on Gibbs sampling and split-merge moves are widely used for inference in these models. However, both methods are restricted to limited types of transitions and suffer from torpid mixing and low accept rates even for problems of modest size. We propose a method that considers a broader range of transitions that are close to equilibrium by exploiting multiple chains in parallel and using the past states adaptively to inform the proposal distribution. The method significantly improves on Gibbs and split-merge sampling as quantified using convergence diagnostics and acceptance rates. Adaptive MCMC methods which use past states to inform the proposal distribution has given rise to many ingenious sampling schemes for continuous problems and the present work can be seen as an important first step in bringing these benefits to partition-based problems	Adaptive Reconfiguration Moves for Dirichlet Mixtures
1702.08420v4	Training Gaussian process-based models typically involves an $ O(N^3)$ computational bottleneck. Popular methods for overcoming this matrix inversion problem cannot adequately model all types of latent functions, and are often not parallelizable. We present an embarrassingly parallel method that takes advantage of inverting block diagonal approximations, while maintaining much of the expressivity of a full covariance matrix. By using importance sampling to average over different realizations of low-rank GP approximations, we ensure our algorithm is both asymptotically unbiased and embarrassingly parallel. We show comparable or improved performance over competing methods, on a range of synthetic and real datasets.	Embarrassingly parallel inference for Gaussian processes

This interpretation might offer an explanation to some of dropout's key properties, such as its robustness to over-fitting. Our interpretation allows us to reason about uncertainty in deep learning, and allows the introduction of the Bayesian machinery into existing deep learning frameworks in a principled way.

1002.3509v2	We consider the maximum likelihood (Viterbi) alignment of a hidden Markov model (HMM). In an HMM, the underlying Markov chain is usually hidden and the Viterbi alignment is often used as the estimate of it. This approach will be referred to as the Viterbi segmentation. The goodness of the Viterbi segmentation can be measured by several risks. In this paper, we prove the existence of asymptotic risks. Being independent of data, the asymptotic risks can be considered as the characteristics of the model that illustrate the long-run behavior of the Viterbi segmentation.

1505.03481v1	In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvector of the unnormalized modularity matrix and the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix is developed. Based on this analysis a method to approximate the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix is given, and the relative error of the approximation is derived. A complete proof of the equivalence between normalized modularity clustering and normalized adjacency clustering is also given. A new metric is defined to describe the agreement of two clustering methods, and some applications and experiments are given to illustrate and corroborate the points that are made in the theoretical development.

1704.06735v3	Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric function estimators. However, their applications are largely limited by the expensive computational cost of the inference procedures. Existing stochastic or distributed synchronous variational inferences, although have alleviated this issue by scaling up GPs to millions of samples, are still far from satisfactory for real-world large applications, where the data sizes are often orders of magnitudes larger, say, billions. To solve this problem, we propose ADVGP, the first Asynchronous Distributed Variational Gaussian Process inference for regression, on the recent large-scale machine learning platform, PARAMETERSERVER. ADVGP uses a novel, flexible variational framework based on a weight space augmentation, and implements the highly efficient, asynchronous proximal gradient optimization. While maintaining comparable or better predictive performance, ADVGP greatly improves upon the efficiency of the existing variational methods. With ADVGP, we effortlessly scale up GP regression to a real-world application with billions of samples and demonstrate an excellent, superior prediction accuracy to the popular linear models.

1708.03914v1	A fundamental question in data analysis, machine learning and signal processing is how to compare between data points. The choice of the distance metric is specifically challenging for high-dimensional data sets, where the problem of meaningfulness is more prominent (e.g. the Euclidean distance between images). In this paper, we propose to exploit a property of high-dimensional data that is usually ignored - which is the structure stemming from the relationships between the coordinates. Specifically we show that organizing similar coordinates in clusters can be exploited for the construction of the Mahalanobis distance between samples. When the observable samples are generated by a nonlinear transformation of hidden variables, the Mahalanobis distance allows the recovery of the Euclidean distances in the hidden space.We illustrate the advantage of our approach on a synthetic example where the discovery of clusters of correlated coordinates improves the estimation of the principal directions of the samples. Our method was applied to real data of gene expression for lung adenocarcinomas (lung cancer). By using the proposed metric we found a partition of subjects to risk groups with a good separation between their Kaplan-Meier survival plot.	Mahalanonbis Distance Informed by Clustering
1211.3601v4	"Statistical inference on graphs is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science, engineering, business, etc. In many applications, we are faced with the reality of errorfully observed graphs. That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. We wish to perform an inference task -- the inference task considered here is ""vertex classification"". However, we do not observe $G$; rather, for each potential edge $uv \in {{V}\choose{2}}$ we observe an ""edge-feature"" which we use to classify $uv$ as edge/not-edge. Thus we errorfully observe $G$ when we observe the graph $\widetilde{G} = (V,\widetilde{E})$ as the edges in $\widetilde{E}$ arise from the classifications of the ""edge-features"", and are expected to be errorful. Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we observe -- more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge-features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality tradeoff for a simple class of random graphs model, namely the stochastic blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for classifying $v$ and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize performance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the quantity/quality tradeoff for errorful obesrvations of the {\it C.\ elegans} connectome graph."	Statistical inference on errorfully observed graphs
0902.0600v5	"This article introduces both a new algorithm for reconstructing epsilon-machines from data, as well as the decisional states. These are defined as the internal states of a system that lead to the same decision, based on a user-provided utility or pay-off function. The utility function encodes some a priori knowledge external to the system, it quantifies how bad it is to make mistakes. The intrinsic underlying structure of the system is modeled by an epsilon-machine and its causal states. The decisional states form a partition of the lower-level causal states that is defined according to the higher-level user's knowledge. In a complex systems perspective, the decisional states are thus the ""emerging"" patterns corresponding to the utility function. The transitions between these decisional states correspond to events that lead to a change of decision. The new REMAPF algorithm estimates both the epsilon-machine and the decisional states from data. Application examples are given for hidden model reconstruction, cellular automata filtering, and edge detection in images."

1706.02326v2	In this paper, we propose a new volume-preserving flow and show that it performs similarly to the linear general normalizing flow. The idea is to enrich a linear Inverse Autoregressive Flow by introducing multiple lower-triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal and combining them using a convex combination. In the experimental studies on MNIST and Histopathology data we show that the proposed approach outperforms other volume-preserving flows and is competitive with current state-of-the-art linear normalizing flow.

1203.4326v3	We consider the bridge linear regression modeling, which can produce a sparse or non-sparse model. A crucial point in the model building process is the selection of adjusted parameters including a regularization parameter and a tuning parameter in bridge regression models. The choice of the adjusted parameters can be viewed as a model selection and evaluation problem. We propose a model selection criterion for evaluating bridge regression models in terms of Bayesian approach. This selection criterion enables us to select the adjusted parameters objectively. We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling strategy through some numerical examples.	Selection of tuning parameters in bridge regression models via Bayesian  information criterion
1703.00598v3	We study a fundamental class of regression models called the second order linear model (SLM). The SLM extends the linear model to high order functional space and has attracted considerable research interest recently. Yet how to efficiently learn the SLM under full generality using nonconvex solver still remains an open question due to several fundamental limitations of the conventional gradient descent learning framework. In this study, we try to attack this problem from a gradient-free approach which we call the moment-estimation-sequence (MES) method. We show that the conventional gradient descent heuristic is biased by the skewness of the distribution therefore is no longer the best practice of learning the SLM. Based on the MES framework, we design a nonconvex alternating iteration process to train a $d$-dimension rank-$k$ SLM within $O(kd)$ memory and one-pass of the dataset. The proposed method converges globally and linearly, achieves $\epsilon$ recovery error after retrieving $O[k^{2}d\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(kd/\epsilon)]$ samples. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals that not all SLMs can be learned on every sub-gaussian distribution. When the instances are sampled from a so-called $\tau$-MIP distribution, the SLM can be learned by $O(p/\tau^{2})$ samples where $p$ and $\tau$ are positive constants depending on the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution. For non-MIP distribution, an addition diagonal-free oracle is necessary and sufficient to guarantee the learnability of the SLM. Numerical simulations verify the sharpness of our bounds on the sampling complexity and the linear convergence rate of our algorithm.	The Second Order Linear Model
1201.2555v2	"We introduce a class of learning problems where the agent is presented with a series of tasks. Intuitively, if there is relation among those tasks, then the information gained during execution of one task has value for the execution of another task. Consequently, the agent is intrinsically motivated to explore its environment beyond the degree necessary to solve the current task it has at hand. We develop a decision theoretic setting that generalises standard reinforcement learning tasks and captures this intuition. More precisely, we consider a multi-stage stochastic game between a learning agent and an opponent. We posit that the setting is a good model for the problem of life-long learning in uncertain environments, where while resources must be spent learning about currently important tasks, there is also the need to allocate effort towards learning about aspects of the world which are not relevant at the moment. This is due to the fact that unpredictable future events may lead to a change of priorities for the decision maker. Thus, in some sense, the model ""explains"" the necessity of curiosity. Apart from introducing the general formalism, the paper provides algorithms. These are evaluated experimentally in some exemplary domains. In addition, performance bounds are proven for some cases of this problem."	Sparse Reward Processes
1605.01573v1	Controlled interventions provide the most direct source of information for learning causal effects. In particular, a dose-response curve can be learned by varying the treatment level and observing the corresponding outcomes. However, interventions can be expensive and time-consuming. Observational data, where the treatment is not controlled by a known mechanism, is sometimes available. Under some strong assumptions, observational data allows for the estimation of dose-response curves. Estimating such curves nonparametrically is hard: sample sizes for controlled interventions may be small, while in the observational case a large number of measured confounders may need to be marginalized. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical Gaussian process prior that constructs a distribution over the dose-response curve by learning from observational data, and reshapes the distribution with a nonparametric affine transform learned from controlled interventions. This function composition from different sources is shown to speed-up learning, which we demonstrate with a thorough sensitivity analysis and an application to modeling the effect of therapy on cognitive skills of premature infants.

1202.1119v2	In this paper, we derive Hybrid, Bayesian and Marginalized Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds (HCRB, BCRB and MCRB) for the single and multiple measurement vector Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) problem of estimating compressible vectors and their prior distribution parameters. We assume the unknown vector to be drawn from a compressible Student-t prior distribution. We derive CRBs that encompass the deterministic or random nature of the unknown parameters of the prior distribution and the regression noise variance. We extend the MCRB to the case where the compressible vector is distributed according to a general compressible prior distribution, of which the generalized Pareto distribution is a special case. We use the derived bounds to uncover the relationship between the compressibility and Mean Square Error (MSE) in the estimates. Further, we illustrate the tightness and utility of the bounds through simulations, by comparing them with the MSE performance of two popular SBL-based estimators. It is found that the MCRB is generally the tightest among the bounds derived and that the MSE performance of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coincides with the MCRB for the compressible vector. Through simulations, we demonstrate the dependence of the MSE performance of SBL based estimators on the compressibility of the vector for several values of the number of observations and at different signal powers.

1711.01847v1	A powerful approach for understanding neural population dynamics is to extract low-dimensional trajectories from population recordings using dimensionality reduction methods. Current approaches for dimensionality reduction on neural data are limited to single population recordings, and can not identify dynamics embedded across multiple measurements. We propose an approach for extracting low-dimensional dynamics from multiple, sequential recordings. Our algorithm scales to data comprising millions of observed dimensions, making it possible to access dynamics distributed across large populations or multiple brain areas. Building on subspace-identification approaches for dynamical systems, we perform parameter estimation by minimizing a moment-matching objective using a scalable stochastic gradient descent algorithm: The model is optimized to predict temporal covariations across neurons and across time. We show how this approach naturally handles missing data and multiple partial recordings, and can identify dynamics and predict correlations even in the presence of severe subsampling and small overlap between recordings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach both on simulated data and a whole-brain larval zebrafish imaging dataset.

1606.05889v1	"Compressed sensing refers to the recovery of a high-dimensional but sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements. Minimizing the $\ell_1$-norm is among the more popular approaches for compressed sensing. A recent paper by Cai and Zhang has provided the ""best possible"" bounds for $\ell_1$-norm minimization to achieve robust sparse recovery (a formal statement of compressed sensing). In some applications, ""group sparsity"" is more natural than conventional sparsity. In this paper we present sufficient conditions for $\ell_1$-norm minimization to achieve robust group sparse recovery. When specialized to conventional sparsity, these conditions reduce to the known ""best possible"" bounds proved earlier by Cai and Zhang. This is achieved by stating and proving a group robust null space property, which is a new result even for conventional sparsity. We also derive bounds for the $\ell_p$-norm of the residual error between the true vector and its approximation, for all $p \in [1,2]$. These bounds are new even for conventional sparsity and of course also for group sparsity, because previously error bounds were available only for the $\ell_2$-norm."	Tight Performance Bounds for Compressed Sensing With Group Sparsity
0908.4489v3	This paper addresses the problem of identifying a lower dimensional space where observed data can be sparsely represented. This under-complete dictionary learning task can be formulated as a blind separation problem of sparse sources linearly mixed with an unknown orthogonal mixing matrix. This issue is formulated in a Bayesian framework. First, the unknown sparse sources are modeled as Bernoulli-Gaussian processes. To promote sparsity, a weighted mixture of an atom at zero and a Gaussian distribution is proposed as prior distribution for the unobserved sources. A non-informative prior distribution defined on an appropriate Stiefel manifold is elected for the mixing matrix. The Bayesian inference on the unknown parameters is conducted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A partially collapsed Gibbs sampler is designed to generate samples asymptotically distributed according to the joint posterior distribution of the unknown model parameters and hyperparameters. These samples are then used to approximate the joint maximum a posteriori estimator of the sources and mixing matrix. Simulations conducted on synthetic data are reported to illustrate the performance of the method for recovering sparse representations. An application to sparse coding on under-complete dictionary is finally investigated.	Bayesian orthogonal component analysis for sparse representation
1705.00394v1	As the emergence and the thriving development of social networks, a huge number of short texts are accumulated and need to be processed. Inferring latent topics of collected short texts is useful for understanding its hidden structure and predicting new contents. Unlike conventional topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a biterm topic model (BTM) was recently proposed for short texts to overcome the sparseness of document-level word co-occurrences by directly modeling the generation process of word pairs. Stochastic inference algorithms based on collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) and collapsed variational inference have been proposed for BTM. However, they either require large computational complexity, or rely on very crude estimation. In this work, we develop a stochastic divergence minimization inference algorithm for BTM to estimate latent topics more accurately in a scalable way. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm compared with existing inference algorithms.	Stochastic Divergence Minimization for Biterm Topic Model
1708.05487v1	We consider a distributed estimation of the double-penalized least squares approach for high dimensional partial linear models, where the sample with a total of $N$ data points is randomly distributed among $m$ machines and the parameters of interest are calculated by merging their $m$ individual estimators. This paper primarily focuses on the investigation of the high dimensional linear components in partial linear models, which is often of more interest. We propose a new debiased averaging estimator of parametric coefficients on the basis of each individual estimator, and establish new non-asymptotic oracle results in high dimensional and distributed settings, provided that $m\leq \sqrt{N/\log p}$ and other mild conditions are satisfied, where $p$ is the linear coefficient dimension. We also provide an experimental evaluation of the proposed method, indicating the numerical effectiveness on simulated data. Even under the classical non-distributed setting, we give the optimal rates of the parametric estimator with a looser tuning parameter limitation, which is required for our error analysis.	A debiased distributed estimation for sparse partially linear models in  diverging dimensions
1401.5508v1	This paper proposes a novel scheme for reduced-rank Gaussian process regression. The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$. On this approximate eigenbasis the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as $\mathcal{O}(nm^2)$ (initial) and $\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ (hyperparameter learning) with $m$ basis functions and $n$ data points. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data.	Hilbert Space Methods for Reduced-Rank Gaussian Process Regression
1610.08189v1	Directed networks are pervasive both in nature and engineered systems, often underlying the complex behavior observed in biological systems, microblogs and social interactions over the web, as well as global financial markets. Since their structures are often unobservable, in order to facilitate network analytics, one generally resorts to approaches capitalizing on measurable nodal processes to infer the unknown topology. Structural equation models (SEMs) are capable of incorporating exogenous inputs to resolve inherent directional ambiguities. However, conventional SEMs assume full knowledge of exogenous inputs, which may not be readily available in some practical settings. The present paper advocates a novel SEM-based topology inference approach that entails factorization of a three-way tensor, constructed from the observed nodal data, using the well-known parallel factor (PARAFAC) decomposition. It turns out that second-order piecewise stationary statistics of exogenous variables suffice to identify the hidden topology. Capitalizing on the uniqueness properties inherent to high-order tensor factorizations, it is shown that topology identification is possible under reasonably mild conditions. In addition, to facilitate real-time operation and inference of time-varying networks, an adaptive (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition scheme which tracks the topology-revealing tensor factors is developed. Extensive tests on simulated and real stock quote data demonstrate the merits of the novel tensor-based approach.

1506.02681v3	There is renewed interest in formulating integration as an inference problem, motivated by obtaining a full distribution over numerical error that can be propagated through subsequent computation. Current methods, such as Bayesian Quadrature, demonstrate impressive empirical performance but lack theoretical analysis. An important challenge is to reconcile these probabilistic integrators with rigorous convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present the first probabilistic integrator that admits such theoretical treatment, called Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature (FWBQ). Under FWBQ, convergence to the true value of the integral is shown to be exponential and posterior contraction rates are proven to be superexponential. In simulations, FWBQ is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and out-performs alternatives based on Frank-Wolfe optimisation. Our approach is applied to successfully quantify numerical error in the solution to a challenging model choice problem in cellular biology.

1706.08495v2	Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with latent variables are probabilistic models which can automatically identify complex stochastic patterns in the data. We describe and study in these models a decomposition of predictive uncertainty into its epistemic and aleatoric components. First, we show how such a decomposition arises naturally in a Bayesian active learning scenario by following an information theoretic approach. Second, we use a similar decomposition to develop a novel risk sensitive objective for safe reinforcement learning (RL). This objective minimizes the effect of model bias in environments whose stochastic dynamics are described by BNNs with latent variables. Our experiments illustrate the usefulness of the resulting decomposition in active learning and safe RL settings.	Uncertainty Decomposition in Bayesian Neural Networks with Latent  Variables
1705.07111v1	This paper introduces the kernel mixture network, a new method for nonparametric estimation of conditional probability densities using neural networks. We model arbitrarily complex conditional densities as linear combinations of a family of kernel functions centered at a subset of training points. The weights are determined by the outer layer of a deep neural network, trained by minimizing the negative log likelihood. This generalizes the popular quantized softmax approach, which can be seen as a kernel mixture network with square and non-overlapping kernels. We test the performance of our method on two important applications, namely Bayesian filtering and generative modeling. In the Bayesian filtering example, we show that the method can be used to filter complex nonlinear and non-Gaussian signals defined on manifolds. The resulting kernel mixture network filter outperforms both the quantized softmax filter and the extended Kalman filter in terms of model likelihood. Finally, our experiments on generative models show that, given the same architecture, the kernel mixture network leads to higher test set likelihood, less overfitting and more diversified and realistic generated samples than the quantized softmax approach.

1612.01678v1	Supervised topic models can help clinical researchers find interpretable cooccurence patterns in count data that are relevant for diagnostics. However, standard formulations of supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation have two problems. First, when documents have many more words than labels, the influence of the labels will be negligible. Second, due to conditional independence assumptions in the graphical model the impact of supervised labels on the learned topic-word probabilities is often minimal, leading to poor predictions on heldout data. We investigate penalized optimization methods for training sLDA that produce interpretable topic-word parameters and useful heldout predictions, using recognition networks to speed-up inference. We report preliminary results on synthetic data and on predicting successful anti-depressant medication given a patient's diagnostic history.	Supervised topic models for clinical interpretability
1605.02190v1	Biological systems are often modelled at different levels of abstraction depending on the particular aims/resources of a study. Such different models often provide qualitatively concordant predictions over specific parametrisations, but it is generally unclear whether model predictions are quantitatively in agreement, and whether such agreement holds for different parametrisations. Here we present a generally applicable statistical machine learning methodology to automatically reconcile the predictions of different models across abstraction levels. Our approach is based on defining a correction map, a random function which modifies the output of a model in order to match the statistics of the output of a different model of the same system. We use two biological examples to give a proof-of-principle demonstration of the methodology, and discuss its advantages and potential further applications.	Matching models across abstraction levels with Gaussian Processes
1608.01234v3	We study the problem of demixing a pair of sparse signals from noisy, nonlinear observations of their superposition. Mathematically, we consider a nonlinear signal observation model, $y_i = g(a_i^Tx) + e_i, \ i=1,\ldots,m$, where $x = \Phi w+\Psi z$ denotes the superposition signal, $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ are orthonormal bases in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $w, z\in\mathbb{R}^n$ are sparse coefficient vectors of the constituent signals, and $e_i$ represents the noise. Moreover, $g$ represents a nonlinear link function, and $a_i\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is the $i$-th row of the measurement matrix, $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$. Problems of this nature arise in several applications ranging from astronomy, computer vision, and machine learning. In this paper, we make some concrete algorithmic progress for the above demixing problem. Specifically, we consider two scenarios: (i) the case when the demixing procedure has no knowledge of the link function, and (ii) the case when the demixing algorithm has perfect knowledge of the link function. In both cases, we provide fast algorithms for recovery of the constituents $w$ and $z$ from the observations. Moreover, we support these algorithms with a rigorous theoretical analysis, and derive (nearly) tight upper bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms for achieving stable recovery of the component signals. We also provide a range of numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms on both real and synthetic signals and images.	Fast Algorithms for Demixing Sparse Signals from Nonlinear Observations
1706.06971v1	An ensemble of models (EM), where each model is constructed on a diverse subset of feature variables, is proposed to rank rare class items ahead of majority class items in a highly unbalanced two class problem. The proposed ensemble relies on an algorithm to group the feature variables into subsets where the variables in a subset work better together in a model and the variables in different subsets work better in separate models. The strength of the EM depends on the algorithm's ability to identify strong and diverse subsets of feature variables. A second phase of ensembling is achieved by aggregating several EMs each optimized on a diverse evaluation metric. The resulting ensemble is called ensemble of models and metrics (EMM). Here, the diverse/complementary evaluation metrics ensure increased diversity among EMs to aggregate. The ensembles are applied to the protein homology data, downloaded from the 2004 KDD cup competition website, to rank proteins in such a way that the rare homologous proteins are found ahead of the majority non-homologous proteins. The ensembles are constructed using feature variables which are various scores from sequence alignments of amino acids in a candidate protein and three dimensional descriptions of a native protein representing functional and structural similarity of proteins. While prediction performances of the EMs are better than the contemporary state-of-the-art ensembles and competitive to the winning procedures of the $2004$ KDD cup competition, the performances of the EMM are found on the top of all. In this application, we have two diverse EMs constructed on two complementary evaluation metrics average precision and rank last, where the former is robust against ranking close homologs and the latter is robust against ranking distant homologs. The advantage of using EMM is that it is robust against both close and distant homologs.	Ensembles of Models and Metrics for Robust Ranking of Homologous  Proteins
1711.00673v3	Information-theoretic Bayesian optimisation techniques have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in tackling important global optimisation problems. However, current information-theoretic approaches: require many approximations in implementation; limit the choice of kernels available to model the objective; and introduce often-prohibitive computational overhead. We develop a fast information-theoretic Bayesian Optimisation method, FITBO, that circumvents the need for sampling the global minimiser, thus significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, in comparison with existing approaches, our method faces fewer constraints on kernel choice and enjoys the merits of dealing with the output space. We demonstrate empirically that FITBO inherits the performance associated with information-theoretic Bayesian optimisation, while being even faster than simpler Bayesian optimisation approaches, such as Expected Improvement.

1610.09659v1	We propose a methodology to explore and measure the pairwise correlations that exist between variables in a dataset. The methodology leverages copulas for encoding dependence between two variables, state-of-the-art optimal transport for providing a relevant geometry to the copulas, and clustering for summarizing the main dependence patterns found between the variables. Some of the clusters centers can be used to parameterize a novel dependence coefficient which can target or forget specific dependence patterns. Finally, we illustrate and benchmark the methodology on several datasets. Code and numerical experiments are available online for reproducible research.

1307.5601v3	In this paper we propose and study a family of sparsity-inducing penalty functions. Since the penalty functions are related to the kinetic energy in special relativity, we call them \emph{kinetic energy plus} (KEP) functions. We construct the KEP function by using the concave conjugate of a $\chi^2$-distance function and present several novel insights into the KEP function with $q=1$. In particular, we derive a thresholding operator based on the KEP function, and prove its mathematical properties and asymptotic properties in sparsity modeling. Moreover, we show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for the KEP function. Additionally, we discuss the relationship of KEP with the penalty functions $\ell_{1/2}$ and MCP. The theoretical and empirical analysis validates that the KEP function is effective and efficient in high-dimensional data modeling.	Kinetic Energy Plus Penalty Functions for Sparse Estimation
1707.04191v3	We propose a novel, theoretically-grounded, acquisition function for batch Bayesian optimization informed by insights from distributionally ambiguous optimization. Our acquisition function is a lower bound on the well-known Expected Improvement function -- which requires a multi-dimensional Gaussian Expectation over a piecewise affine function -- and is computed by evaluating instead the best-case expectation over all probability distributions consistent with the same mean and variance as the original Gaussian distribution. Unlike alternative approaches including Expected Improvement, our proposed acquisition function avoids multi-dimensional integrations entirely, and can be computed exactly as the solution of a convex optimization problem in the form of a tractable semidefinite program (SDP). Moreover, we prove that the solution of this SDP also yields exact numerical derivatives, which enable efficient optimization of the acquisition function. Finally, it efficiently handles marginalized posteriors with respect to the Gaussian Process' hyperparameters. We demonstrate superior performance to heuristic alternatives and approximations of the intractable expected improvement, justifying this performance difference based on simple examples that break the assumptions of state-of-the-art methods.

1105.0875v2	We compare the risk of ridge regression to a simple variant of ordinary least squares, in which one simply projects the data onto a finite dimensional subspace (as specified by a Principal Component Analysis) and then performs an ordinary (un-regularized) least squares regression in this subspace. This note shows that the risk of this ordinary least squares method is within a constant factor (namely 4) of the risk of ridge regression.	A Risk Comparison of Ordinary Least Squares vs Ridge Regression
1105.1853v1	While loopy belief propagation (LBP) performs reasonably well for inference in some Gaussian graphical models with cycles, its performance is unsatisfactory for many others. In particular for some models LBP does not converge, and in general when it does converge, the computed variances are incorrect (except for cycle-free graphs for which belief propagation (BP) is non-iterative and exact). In this paper we propose {\em feedback message passing} (FMP), a message-passing algorithm that makes use of a special set of vertices (called a {\em feedback vertex set} or {\em FVS}) whose removal results in a cycle-free graph. In FMP, standard BP is employed several times on the cycle-free subgraph excluding the FVS while a special message-passing scheme is used for the nodes in the FVS. The computational complexity of exact inference is $O(k^2n)$, where $k$ is the number of feedback nodes, and $n$ is the total number of nodes. When the size of the FVS is very large, FMP is intractable. Hence we propose {\em approximate FMP}, where a pseudo-FVS is used instead of an FVS, and where inference in the non-cycle-free graph obtained by removing the pseudo-FVS is carried out approximately using LBP. We show that, when approximate FMP converges, it yields exact means and variances on the pseudo-FVS and exact means throughout the remainder of the graph. We also provide theoretical results on the convergence and accuracy of approximate FMP. In particular, we prove error bounds on variance computation. Based on these theoretical results, we design efficient algorithms to select a pseudo-FVS of bounded size. The choice of the pseudo-FVS allows us to explicitly trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results show that using a pseudo-FVS of size no larger than $\log(n)$, this procedure converges much more often, more quickly, and provides more accurate results than LBP on the entire graph.

1012.1416v1	The goal of cross-domain object matching (CDOM) is to find correspondence between two sets of objects in different domains in an unsupervised way. Photo album summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system. CDOM is usually formulated as finding a mapping from objects in one domain (photos) to objects in the other domain (frame) so that the pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art CDOM method employs a kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that the kernel parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection problem. Through experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and photo album summarization tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated.	Cross-Domain Object Matching with Model Selection
1202.3778v1	We present sparse topical coding (STC), a non-probabilistic formulation of topic models for discovering latent representations of large collections of data. Unlike probabilistic topic models, STC relaxes the normalization constraint of admixture proportions and the constraint of defining a normalized likelihood function. Such relaxations make STC amenable to: 1) directly control the sparsity of inferred representations by using sparsity-inducing regularizers; 2) be seamlessly integrated with a convex error function (e.g., SVM hinge loss) for supervised learning; and 3) be efficiently learned with a simply structured coordinate descent algorithm. Our results demonstrate the advantages of STC and supervised MedSTC on identifying topical meanings of words and improving classification accuracy and time efficiency.	Sparse Topical Coding
0809.1493v1	For supervised and unsupervised learning, positive definite kernels allow to use large and potentially infinite dimensional feature spaces with a computational cost that only depends on the number of observations. This is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by Euclidean or Hilbertian norms. In this paper, we explore penalizing by sparsity-inducing norms such as the l1-norm or the block l1-norm. We assume that the kernel decomposes into a large sum of individual basis kernels which can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a hierarchical multiple kernel learning framework, in polynomial time in the number of selected kernels. This framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the UCI repository show that efficiently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance.	Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel  Learning
1110.6416v1	Most methods for decision-theoretic online learning are based on the Hedge algorithm, which takes a parameter called the learning rate. In most previous analyses the learning rate was carefully tuned to obtain optimal worst-case performance, leading to suboptimal performance on easy instances, for example when there exists an action that is significantly better than all others. We propose a new way of setting the learning rate, which adapts to the difficulty of the learning problem: in the worst case our procedure still guarantees optimal performance, but on easy instances it achieves much smaller regret. In particular, our adaptive method achieves constant regret in a probabilistic setting, when there exists an action that on average obtains strictly smaller loss than all other actions. We also provide a simulation study comparing our approach to existing methods.	Adaptive Hedge
1607.05432v3	This work falls within the context of predicting the value of a real function at some input locations given a limited number of observations of this function. The Kriging interpolation technique (or Gaussian process regression) is often considered to tackle such a problem but the method suffers from its computational burden when the number of observation points is large. We introduce in this article nested Kriging predictors which are constructed by aggregating sub-models based on subsets of observation points. This approach is proven to have better theoretical properties than other aggregation methods that can be found in the literature. Contrarily to some other methods it can be shown that the proposed aggregation method is consistent. Finally, the practical interest of the proposed method is illustrated on simulated datasets and on an industrial test case with $10^4$ observations in a 6-dimensional space.	Nested Kriging predictions for datasets with large number of  observations
1702.03994v1	As data collections become larger, exploratory regression analysis becomes more important but more challenging. When observations are hierarchically clustered the problem is even more challenging because model selection with mixed effect models can produce misleading results when nonlinear effects are not included into the model (Bauer and Cai, 2009). A machine learning method called boosted decision trees (Friedman, 2001) is a good approach for exploratory regression analysis in real data sets because it can detect predictors with nonlinear and interaction effects while also accounting for missing data. We propose an extension to boosted decision decision trees called metboost for hierarchically clustered data. It works by constraining the structure of each tree to be the same across groups, but allowing the terminal node means to differ. This allows predictors and split points to lead to different predictions within each group, and approximates nonlinear group specific effects. Importantly, metboost remains computationally feasible for thousands of observations and hundreds of predictors that may contain missing values. We apply the method to predict math performance for 15,240 students from 751 schools in data collected in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002 (Ingels et al., 2007), allowing 76 predictors to have unique effects for each school. When comparing results to boosted decision trees, metboost has 15% improved prediction performance. Results of a large simulation study show that metboost has up to 70% improved variable selection performance and up to 30% improved prediction performance compared to boosted decision trees when group sizes are small	metboost: Exploratory regression analysis with hierarchically clustered  data
1512.01665v1	Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm for hidden Markov models, in a sequential data setting. Given a collapsed hidden Markov Model, we break its long Markov chain into a set of short subchains. We propose a novel sum-product algorithm to update the posteriors of the subchains, taking into account their boundary transitions due to the sequential dependencies. Our experiments on two discrete datasets show that our collapsed algorithm is scalable to very large datasets, memory efficient and significantly more accurate than the existing uncollapsed algorithm.

1507.05899v2	Capturing the dependence structure of multivariate extreme events is a major concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple sources, e.g. portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management and anomaly detection. One convenient (non-parametric) characterization of extremal dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable 'directions' of extremes, that is, the relative contribution of each feature/coordinate of the 'largest' observations. Modeling the angular measure in high dimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at exhibiting a sparsity pattern within the dependence structure of extremes. This is done by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on representative sets of directions, corresponding to specific sub-cones of $R^d\_+$. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct application a --first-- anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT. This algorithm builds a sparse 'normal profile' of extreme behaviours, to be confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.	Sparsity in Multivariate Extremes with Applications to Anomaly Detection
1607.02085v1	We present a general framework for classifying partially observed dynamical systems based on the idea of learning in the model space. In contrast to the existing approaches using model point estimates to represent individual data items, we employ posterior distributions over models, thus taking into account in a principled manner the uncertainty due to both the generative (observational and/or dynamic noise) and observation (sampling in time) processes. We evaluate the framework on two testbeds - a biological pathway model and a stochastic double-well system. Crucially, we show that the classifier performance is not impaired when the model class used for inferring posterior distributions is much more simple than the observation-generating model class, provided the reduced complexity inferential model class captures the essential characteristics needed for the given classification task.	A Classification Framework for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems
1602.04548v1	In this paper we study predictive pattern mining problems where the goal is to construct a predictive model based on a subset of predictive patterns in the database. Our main contribution is to introduce a novel method called safe pattern pruning (SPP) for a class of predictive pattern mining problems. The SPP method allows us to efficiently find a superset of all the predictive patterns in the database that are needed for the optimal predictive model. The advantage of the SPP method over existing boosting-type method is that the former can find the superset by a single search over the database, while the latter requires multiple searches. The SPP method is inspired by recent development of safe feature screening. In order to extend the idea of safe feature screening into predictive pattern mining, we derive a novel pruning rule called safe pattern pruning (SPP) rule that can be used for searching over the tree defined among patterns in the database. The SPP rule has a property that, if a node corresponding to a pattern in the database is pruned out by the SPP rule, then it is guaranteed that all the patterns corresponding to its descendant nodes are never needed for the optimal predictive model. We apply the SPP method to graph mining and item-set mining problems, and demonstrate its computational advantage.	Safe Pattern Pruning: An Efficient Approach for Predictive Pattern  Mining
1308.4211v2	We propose a general framework for reduced-rank modeling of matrix-valued data. By applying a generalized nuclear norm penalty we can directly model low-dimensional latent variables associated with rows and columns. Our framework flexibly incorporates row and column features, smoothing kernels, and other sources of side information by penalizing deviations from the row and column models. Moreover, a large class of these models can be estimated scalably using convex optimization. The computational bottleneck in each case is one singular value decomposition per iteration of a large but easy-to-apply matrix. Our framework generalizes traditional convex matrix completion and multi-task learning methods as well as maximum a posteriori estimation under a large class of popular hierarchical Bayesian models.

1706.08984v1	"Learning by children and animals occurs effortlessly and largely without obvious supervision. Successes in automating supervised learning have not translated to the more ambiguous realm of unsupervised learning where goals and labels are not provided. Barlow (1961) suggested that the signal that brains leverage for unsupervised learning is dependence, or redundancy, in the sensory environment. Dependence can be characterized using the information-theoretic multivariate mutual information measure called total correlation. The principle of Total Cor-relation Ex-planation (CorEx) is to learn representations of data that ""explain"" as much dependence in the data as possible. We review some manifestations of this principle along with successes in unsupervised learning problems across diverse domains including human behavior, biology, and language."

1611.01096v1	In this article, we study spectral methods for community detection based on $ \alpha$-parametrized normalized modularity matrix hereafter called $ {\bf L}_\alpha $ in heterogeneous graph models. We show, in a regime where community detection is not asymptotically trivial, that $ {\bf L}_\alpha $ can be well approximated by a more tractable random matrix which falls in the family of spiked random matrices. The analysis of this equivalent spiked random matrix allows us to improve spectral methods for community detection and assess their performances in the regime under study. In particular, we prove the existence of an optimal value $ \alpha_{\rm opt} $ of the parameter $ \alpha $ for which the detection of communities is best ensured and we provide an on-line estimation of $ \alpha_{\rm opt} $ only based on the knowledge of the graph adjacency matrix. Unlike classical spectral methods for community detection where clustering is performed on the eigenvectors associated with extreme eigenvalues, we show through our theoretical analysis that a regularization should instead be performed on those eigenvectors prior to clustering in heterogeneous graphs. Finally, through a deeper study of the regularized eigenvectors used for clustering, we assess the performances of our new algorithm for community detection. Numerical simulations in the course of the article show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art spectral methods on dense heterogeneous graphs.

1108.3476v2	We present a data dependent generalization bound for a large class of regularized algorithms which implement structured sparsity constraints. The bound can be applied to standard squared-norm regularization, the Lasso, the group Lasso, some versions of the group Lasso with overlapping groups, multiple kernel learning and other regularization schemes. In all these cases competitive results are obtained. A novel feature of our bound is that it can be applied in an infinite dimensional setting such as the Lasso in a separable Hilbert space or multiple kernel learning with a countable number of kernels.	Structured Sparsity and Generalization
1507.00566v1	This paper proposes a novel Gaussian process approach to fault removal in time-series data. Fault removal does not delete the faulty signal data but, instead, massages the fault from the data. We assume that only one fault occurs at any one time and model the signal by two separate non-parametric Gaussian process models for both the physical phenomenon and the fault. In order to facilitate fault removal we introduce the Markov Region Link kernel for handling non-stationary Gaussian processes. This kernel is piece-wise stationary but guarantees that functions generated by it and their derivatives (when required) are everywhere continuous. We apply this kernel to the removal of drift and bias errors in faulty sensor data and also to the recovery of EOG artifact corrupted EEG signals.

1205.2627v1	Incorporating domain knowledge into the modeling process is an effective way to improve learning accuracy. However, as it is provided by humans, domain knowledge can only be specified with some degree of uncertainty. We propose to explicitly model such uncertainty through probabilistic constraints over the parameter space. In contrast to hard parameter constraints, our approach is effective also when the domain knowledge is inaccurate and generally results in superior modeling accuracy. We focus on generative and conditional modeling where the parameters are assigned a Dirichlet or Gaussian prior and demonstrate the framework with experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.	Domain Knowledge Uncertainty and Probabilistic Parameter Constraints
0804.3835v5	We extend the well-known BFGS quasi-Newton method and its memory-limited variant LBFGS to the optimization of nonsmooth convex objectives. This is done in a rigorous fashion by generalizing three components of BFGS to subdifferentials: the local quadratic model, the identification of a descent direction, and the Wolfe line search conditions. We prove that under some technical conditions, the resulting subBFGS algorithm is globally convergent in objective function value. We apply its memory-limited variant (subLBFGS) to L_2-regularized risk minimization with the binary hinge loss. To extend our algorithm to the multiclass and multilabel settings, we develop a new, efficient, exact line search algorithm. We prove its worst-case time complexity bounds, and show that our line search can also be used to extend a recently developed bundle method to the multiclass and multilabel settings. We also apply the direction-finding component of our algorithm to L_1-regularized risk minimization with logistic loss. In all these contexts our methods perform comparable to or better than specialized state-of-the-art solvers on a number of publicly available datasets. An open source implementation of our algorithms is freely available.	A Quasi-Newton Approach to Nonsmooth Convex Optimization Problems in  Machine Learning
1205.2662v1	Latent Dirichlet analysis, or topic modeling, is a flexible latent variable framework for modeling high-dimensional sparse count data. Various learning algorithms have been developed in recent years, including collapsed Gibbs sampling, variational inference, and maximum a posteriori estimation, and this variety motivates the need for careful empirical comparisons. In this paper, we highlight the close connections between these approaches. We find that the main differences are attributable to the amount of smoothing applied to the counts. When the hyperparameters are optimized, the differences in performance among the algorithms diminish significantly. The ability of these algorithms to achieve solutions of comparable accuracy gives us the freedom to select computationally efficient approaches. Using the insights gained from this comparative study, we show how accurate topic models can be learned in several seconds on text corpora with thousands of documents.	On Smoothing and Inference for Topic Models
1506.07944v2	Given a family of probability measures in P(X), the space of probability measures on a Hilbert space X, our goal in this paper is to highlight one ore more curves in P(X) that summarize efficiently that family. We propose to study this problem under the optimal transport (Wasserstein) geometry, using curves that are restricted to be geodesic segments under that metric. We show that concepts that play a key role in Euclidean PCA, such as data centering or orthogonality of principal directions, find a natural equivalent in the optimal transport geometry, using Wasserstein means and differential geometry. The implementation of these ideas is, however, computationally challenging. To achieve scalable algorithms that can handle thousands of measures, we propose to use a relaxed definition for geodesics and regularized optimal transport distances. The interest of our approach is demonstrated on images seen either as shapes or color histograms.	Principal Geodesic Analysis for Probability Measures under the Optimal  Transport Metric
1110.0413v1	We study a norm for structured sparsity which leads to sparse linear predictors whose supports are unions of prede ned overlapping groups of variables. We call the obtained formulation latent group Lasso, since it is based on applying the usual group Lasso penalty on a set of latent variables. A detailed analysis of the norm and its properties is presented and we characterize conditions under which the set of groups associated with latent variables are correctly identi ed. We motivate and discuss the delicate choice of weights associated to each group, and illustrate this approach on simulated data and on the problem of breast cancer prognosis from gene expression data.

1401.6276v1	The Laplace approximation calls for the computation of second derivatives at the likelihood maximum. When the maximum is found by the EM-algorithm, there is a convenient way to compute these derivatives. The likelihood gradient can be obtained from the EM-auxiliary, while the Hessian can be obtained from this gradient with the Pearlmutter trick.	The EM algorithm and the Laplace Approximation
1202.6001v2	We introduce a novel and efficient sampling algorithm for the Multiplicative Attribute Graph Model (MAGM - Kim and Leskovec (2010)}). Our algorithm is \emph{strictly} more efficient than the algorithm proposed by Yun and Vishwanathan (2012), in the sense that our method extends the \emph{best} time complexity guarantee of their algorithm to a larger fraction of parameter space. Both in theory and in empirical evaluation on sparse graphs, our new algorithm outperforms the previous one. To design our algorithm, we first define a stochastic \emph{ball-dropping process} (BDP). Although a special case of this process was introduced as an efficient approximate sampling algorithm for the Kronecker Product Graph Model (KPGM - Leskovec et al. (2010)}), neither \emph{why} such an approximation works nor \emph{what} is the actual distribution this process is sampling from has been addressed so far to the best of our knowledge. Our rigorous treatment of the BDP enables us to clarify the rational behind a BDP approximation of KPGM, and design an efficient sampling algorithm for the MAGM.	Efficiently Sampling Multiplicative Attribute Graphs Using a  Ball-Dropping Process
1304.4549v1	Popular sparse estimation methods based on $\ell_1$-relaxation, such as the Lasso and the Dantzig selector, require the knowledge of the variance of the noise in order to properly tune the regularization parameter. This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks---such as time series, random fields, inverse problems---for which the noise is rarely homoscedastic and its level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure.	Learning Heteroscedastic Models by Convex Programming under Group  Sparsity
1203.3489v1	Exponential family extensions of principal component analysis (EPCA) have received a considerable amount of attention in recent years, demonstrating the growing need for basic modeling tools that do not assume the squared loss or Gaussian distribution. We extend the EPCA model toolbox by presenting the first exponential family multi-view learning methods of the partial least squares and canonical correlation analysis, based on a unified representation of EPCA as matrix factorization of the natural parameters of exponential family. The models are based on a new family of priors that are generally usable for all such factorizations. We also introduce new inference strategies, and demonstrate how the methods outperform earlier ones when the Gaussianity assumption does not hold.	Bayesian exponential family projections for coupled data sources
1305.0319v6	Dasgupta and Shulman showed that a two-round variant of the EM algorithm can learn mixture of Gaussian distributions with near optimal precision with high probability if the Gaussian distributions are well separated and if the dimension is sufficiently high. In this paper, we generalize their theory to learning mixture of high-dimensional Bernoulli templates. Each template is a binary vector, and a template generates examples by randomly switching its binary components independently with a certain probability. In computer vision applications, a binary vector is a feature map of an image, where each binary component indicates whether a local feature or structure is present or absent within a certain cell of the image domain. A Bernoulli template can be considered as a statistical model for images of objects (or parts of objects) from the same category. We show that the two-round EM algorithm can learn mixture of Bernoulli templates with near optimal precision with high probability, if the Bernoulli templates are sufficiently different and if the number of features is sufficiently high. We illustrate the theoretical results by synthetic and real examples.	Learning Mixtures of Bernoulli Templates by Two-Round EM with  Performance Guarantee
1501.02844v1	Item response theory (IRT) models for categorical response data are widely used in the analysis of educational data, computerized adaptive testing, and psychological surveys. However, most IRT models rely on both the assumption that categories are strictly ordered and the assumption that this ordering is known a priori. These assumptions are impractical in many real-world scenarios, such as multiple-choice exams where the levels of incorrectness for the distractor categories are often unknown. While a number of results exist on IRT models for unordered categorical data, they tend to have restrictive modeling assumptions that lead to poor data fitting performance in practice. Furthermore, existing unordered categorical models have parameters that are difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for unordered categorical IRT that we call SPRITE (short for stochastic polytomous response item model) that: (i) analyzes both ordered and unordered categories, (ii) offers interpretable outputs, and (iii) provides improved data fitting compared to existing models. We compare SPRITE to existing item response models and demonstrate its efficacy on both synthetic and real-world educational datasets.	SPRITE: A Response Model For Multiple Choice Testing
1010.3460v2	We present a simple and fast geometric method for modeling data by a union of affine subspaces. The method begins by forming a collection of local best-fit affine subspaces, i.e., subspaces approximating the data in local neighborhoods. The correct sizes of the local neighborhoods are determined automatically by the Jones' $\beta_2$ numbers (we prove under certain geometric conditions that our method finds the optimal local neighborhoods). The collection of subspaces is further processed by a greedy selection procedure or a spectral method to generate the final model. We discuss applications to tracking-based motion segmentation and clustering of faces under different illuminating conditions. We give extensive experimental evidence demonstrating the state of the art accuracy and speed of the suggested algorithms on these problems and also on synthetic hybrid linear data as well as the MNIST handwritten digits data; and we demonstrate how to use our algorithms for fast determination of the number of affine subspaces.	Hybrid Linear Modeling via Local Best-fit Flats
1004.0456v1	We propose in this paper an exploratory analysis algorithm for functional data. The method partitions a set of functions into $K$ clusters and represents each cluster by a simple prototype (e.g., piecewise constant). The total number of segments in the prototypes, $P$, is chosen by the user and optimally distributed among the clusters via two dynamic programming algorithms. The practical relevance of the method is shown on two real world datasets.	Exploratory Analysis of Functional Data via Clustering and Optimal  Segmentation
1301.3611v4	Dictionary Learning has proven to be a powerful tool for many image processing tasks, where atoms are typically defined on small image patches. As a drawback, the dictionary only encodes basic structures. In addition, this approach treats patches of different locations in one single set, which means a loss of information when features are well-aligned across signals. This is the case, for instance, in multi-trial magneto- or electroencephalography (M/EEG). Learning the dictionary on the entire signals could make use of the alignement and reveal higher-level features. In this case, however, small missalignements or phase variations of features would not be compensated for. In this paper, we propose an extension to the common dictionary learning framework to overcome these limitations by allowing atoms to adapt their position across signals. The method is validated on simulated and real neuroelectric data.	Jitter-Adaptive Dictionary Learning - Application to Multi-Trial  Neuroelectric Signals
1510.07965v2	We present Blitzkriging, a new approach to fast inference for Gaussian processes, applicable to regression, optimisation and classification. State-of-the-art (stochastic) inference for Gaussian processes on very large datasets scales cubically in the number of 'inducing inputs', variables introduced to factorise the model. Blitzkriging shares state-of-the-art scaling with data, but reduces the scaling in the number of inducing points to approximately linear. Further, in contrast to other methods, Blitzkriging: does not force the data to conform to any particular structure (including grid-like); reduces reliance on error-prone optimisation of inducing point locations; and is able to learn rich (covariance) structure from the data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on real data in regression, time-series prediction and signal-interpolation experiments.	Blitzkriging: Kronecker-structured Stochastic Gaussian Processes
1108.4079v1	Scene understanding remains a significant challenge in the computer vision community. The visual psychophysics literature has demonstrated the importance of interdependence among parts of the scene. Yet, the majority of methods in computer vision remain local. Pictorial structures have arisen as a fundamental parts-based model for some vision problems, such as articulated object detection. However, the form of classical pictorial structures limits their applicability for global problems, such as semantic pixel labeling. In this paper, we propose an extension of the pictorial structures approach, called pixel-support parts-sparse pictorial structures, or PS3, to overcome this limitation. Our model extends the classical form in two ways: first, it defines parts directly based on pixel-support rather than in a parametric form, and second, it specifies a space of plausible parts-based scene models and permits one to be used for inference on any given image. PS3 makes strides toward unifying object-level and pixel-level modeling of scene elements. In this report, we implement the first half of our model and rely upon external knowledge to provide an initial graph structure for a given image. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the capability of this new parts-based view of scene modeling.	Toward Parts-Based Scene Understanding with Pixel-Support Parts-Sparse  Pictorial Structures
1702.08402v2	We introduce a novel kernel that models input-dependent couplings across multiple latent processes. The pairwise joint kernel measures covariance along inputs and across different latent signals in a mutually-dependent fashion. A latent correlation Gaussian process (LCGP) model combines these non-stationary latent components into multiple outputs by an input-dependent mixing matrix. Probit classification and support for multiple observation sets are derived by Variational Bayesian inference. Results on several datasets indicate that the LCGP model can recover the correlations between latent signals while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance. We highlight the latent covariances with an EEG classification dataset where latent brain processes and their couplings simultaneously emerge from the model.

1311.5479v2	We investigate a generic problem of learning pairwise exponential family graphical models with pairwise sufficient statistics defined by a global mapping function, e.g., Mercer kernels. This subclass of pairwise graphical models allow us to flexibly capture complex interactions among variables beyond pairwise product. We propose two $\ell_1$-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimators to learn the model parameters from i.i.d. samples. The first one is a joint estimator which estimates all the parameters simultaneously. The second one is a node-wise conditional estimator which estimates the parameters individually for each node. For both estimators, we show that under proper conditions the extra flexibility gained in our model comes at almost no cost of statistical and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real datasets.	Learning Pairwise Graphical Models with Nonlinear Sufficient Statistics
1703.10936v1	Accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease dynamics can be valuable to public health organizations that plan interventions to decrease or prevent disease transmission. A great variety of models have been developed for this task, using different model structures, covariates, and targets for prediction. Experience has shown that the performance of these models varies; some tend to do better or worse in different seasons or at different points within a season. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to obtain a single prediction that leverages the strengths of each model. We considered a range of ensemble methods that each form a predictive density for a target of interest as a weighted sum of the predictive densities from component models. In the simplest case, equal weight is assigned to each component model; in the most complex case, the weights vary with the region, prediction target, week of the season when the predictions are made, a measure of component model uncertainty, and recent observations of disease incidence. We applied these methods to predict measures of influenza season timing and severity in the United States, both at the national and regional levels, using three component models. We trained the models on retrospective predictions from 14 seasons (1997/1998 - 2010/2011) and evaluated each model's prospective, out-of-sample performance in the five subsequent influenza seasons. In this test phase, the ensemble methods showed overall performance that was similar to the best of the component models, but offered more consistent performance across seasons than the component models. Ensemble methods offer the potential to deliver more reliable predictions to public health decision makers.	Prediction of infectious disease epidemics via weighted density  ensembles
0909.4370v2	We provide a systematic study of the problem of finding the source of a rumor in a network. We model rumor spreading in a network with a variant of the popular SIR model and then construct an estimator for the rumor source. This estimator is based upon a novel topological quantity which we term \textbf{rumor centrality}. We establish that this is an ML estimator for a class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has non-trivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources in networks which are not tree-like.	Rumors in a Network: Who's the Culprit?
1607.00706v1	Community-based Question Answering (CQA) sites play an important role in addressing health information needs. However, a significant number of posted questions remain unanswered. Automatically answering the posted questions can provide a useful source of information for online health communities. In this study, we developed an algorithm to automatically answer health-related questions based on past questions and answers (QA). We also aimed to understand information embedded within online health content that are good features in identifying valid answers. Our proposed algorithm uses information retrieval techniques to identify candidate answers from resolved QA. In order to rank these candidates, we implemented a semi-supervised leaning algorithm that extracts the best answer to a question. We assessed this approach on a curated corpus from Yahoo! Answers and compared against a rule-based string similarity baseline. On our dataset, the semi-supervised learning algorithm has an accuracy of 86.2%. UMLS-based (health-related) features used in the model enhance the algorithm's performance by proximately 8 %. A reasonably high rate of accuracy is obtained given that the data is considerably noisy. Important features distinguishing a valid answer from an invalid answer include text length, number of stop words contained in a test question, a distance between the test question and other questions in the corpus as well as a number of overlapping health-related terms between questions. Overall, our automated QA system based on historical QA pairs is shown to be effective according to the data set in this case study. It is developed for general use in the health care domain which can also be applied to other CQA sites.

1606.06959v2	We consider training probabilistic classifiers in the case of a large number of classes. The number of classes is assumed too large to perform exact normalisation over all classes. To account for this we consider a simple approach that directly approximates the likelihood. We show that this simple approach works well on toy problems and is competitive with recently introduced alternative non-likelihood based approximations. Furthermore, we relate this approach to a simple ranking objective. This leads us to suggest a specific setting for the optimal threshold in the ranking objective.

1111.4118v1	Recent research has shown that performance in signal processing tasks can often be significantly improved by using signal models based on sparse representations, where a signal is approximated using a small number of elements from a fixed dictionary. Unfortunately, inference in this model involves solving non-smooth optimization problems that are computationally expensive. While significant efforts have focused on developing digital algorithms specifically for this problem, these algorithms are inappropriate for many applications because of the time and power requirements necessary to solve large optimization problems. Based on recent work in computational neuroscience, we explore the potential advantages of continuous time dynamical systems for solving sparse approximation problems if they were implemented in analog VLSI. Specifically, in the simulated task of recovering synthetic and MRI data acquired via compressive sensing techniques, we show that these systems can potentially perform recovery at time scales of 10-20{\mu}s, supporting datarates of 50-100 kHz (orders of magnitude faster that digital algorithms). Furthermore, we show analytically that a wide range of sparse approximation problems can be solved in the same basic architecture, including approximate $\ell^p$ norms, modified $\ell^1$ norms, re-weighted $\ell^1$ and $\ell^2$, the block $\ell^1$ norm and classic Tikhonov regularization.

1507.00507v1	A new Bayesian approach to linear system identification has been proposed in a series of recent papers. The main idea is to frame linear system identification as predictor estimation in an infinite dimensional space, with the aid of regularization/Bayesian techniques. This approach guarantees the identification of stable predictors based on the prediction error minimization. Unluckily, the stability of the predictors does not guarantee the stability of the impulse response of the system. In this paper we propose and compare various techniques to address this issue. Simulations results comparing these techniques will be provided.	Identification of stable models via nonparametric prediction error  methods
1709.06970v1	Bayesian graphical models are a useful tool for understanding dependence relationships among many variables, particularly in situations with external prior information. In high-dimensional settings, the space of possible graphs becomes enormous, rendering even state-of-the-art Bayesian stochastic search computationally infeasible. We propose a deterministic alternative to estimate Gaussian and Gaussian copula graphical models using an Expectation Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm, extending the EM approach from Bayesian variable selection to graphical model estimation. We show that the ECM approach enables fast posterior exploration under a sequence of mixture priors, and can incorporate multiple sources of information.

1310.5415v2	"Substantial evidence indicates that major psychiatric disorders are associated with distributed neural dysconnectivity, leading to strong interest in using neuroimaging methods to accurately predict disorder status. In this work, we are specifically interested in a multivariate approach that uses features derived from whole-brain resting state functional connectomes. However, functional connectomes reside in a high dimensional space, which complicates model interpretation and introduces numerous statistical and computational challenges. Traditional feature selection techniques are used to reduce data dimensionality, but are blind to the spatial structure of the connectomes. We propose a regularization framework where the 6-D structure of the functional connectome is explicitly taken into account via the fused Lasso or the GraphNet regularizer. Our method only restricts the loss function to be convex and margin-based, allowing non-differentiable loss functions such as the hinge-loss to be used. Using the fused Lasso or GraphNet regularizer with the hinge-loss leads to a structured sparse support vector machine (SVM) with embedded feature selection. We introduce a novel efficient optimization algorithm based on the augmented Lagrangian and the classical alternating direction method, which can solve both fused Lasso and GraphNet regularized SVM with very little modification. We also demonstrate that the inner subproblems of the algorithm can be solved efficiently in analytic form by coupling the variable splitting strategy with a data augmentation scheme. Experiments on simulated data and resting state scans from a large schizophrenia dataset show that our proposed approach can identify predictive regions that are spatially contiguous in the 6-D ""connectome space,"" offering an additional layer of interpretability that could provide new insights about various disease processes."

1704.08231v2	"We give convergence guarantees for estimating the coefficients of a symmetric mixture of two linear regressions by expectation maximization (EM). In particular, we show that convergence of the empirical iterates is guaranteed provided the algorithm is initialized in an unbounded cone. That is, if the initializer has a large cosine angle with the population coefficient vector and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is large, a sample-splitting version of the EM algorithm converges to the true coefficient vector with high probability. Here ""large"" means that each quantity is required to be at least a universal constant. Finally, we show that the population EM operator is not globally contractive by characterizing a region where it fails. We give empirical evidence that suggests that the sample based EM performs poorly when intitializers are drawn from this set. Interestingly, our analysis borrows from tools used in the problem of estimating the centers of a symmetric mixture of two Gaussians by EM."

0909.2332v1	We investigate the issue of model selection and the use of the nonconformity (strangeness) measure in batch learning. Using the nonconformity measure we propose a new training algorithm that helps avoid the need for Cross-Validation or Leave-One-Out model selection strategies. We provide a new generalisation error bound using the notion of nonconformity to upper bound the loss of each test example and show that our proposed approach is comparable to standard model selection methods, but with theoretical guarantees of success and faster convergence. We demonstrate our novel model selection technique using the Support Vector Machine.	A Nonconformity Approach to Model Selection for SVMs
1002.1994v3	We assume data independently sampled from a mixture distribution on the unit ball of the D-dimensional Euclidean space with K+1 components: the first component is a uniform distribution on that ball representing outliers and the other K components are uniform distributions along K d-dimensional linear subspaces restricted to that ball. We study both the simultaneous recovery of all K underlying subspaces and the recovery of the best l0 subspace (i.e., with largest number of points) by minimizing the lp-averaged distances of data points from d-dimensional subspaces of the D-dimensional space. Unlike other lp minimization problems, this minimization is non-convex for all p>0 and thus requires different methods for its analysis. We show that if 0<p <= 1, then both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace can be precisely recovered by lp minimization with overwhelming probability. This result extends to additive homoscedastic uniform noise around the subspaces (i.e., uniform distribution in a strip around them) and near recovery with an error proportional to the noise level. On the other hand, if K>1 and p>1, then we show that both all underlying subspaces and the best l0 subspace cannot be recovered and even nearly recovered. Further relaxations are also discussed. We use the results of this paper for partially justifying recent effective algorithms for modeling data by mixtures of multiple subspaces as well as for discussing the effect of using variants of lp minimizations in RANSAC-type strategies for single subspace recovery.

1701.08916v2	Prototypal analysis is introduced to overcome two shortcomings of archetypal analysis: its sensitivity to outliers and its non-locality, which reduces its applicability as a learning tool. Same as archetypal analysis, prototypal analysis finds prototypes through convex combination of the data points and approximates the data through convex combination of the archetypes, but it adds a penalty for using prototypes distant from the data points for their reconstruction. Prototypal analysis can be extended---via kernel embedding---to probability distributions, since the convexity of the prototypes makes them interpretable as mixtures. Finally, prototypal regression is developed, a robust supervised procedure which allows the use of distributions as either features or labels.	Prototypal Analysis and Prototypal Regression
1704.04031v1	Matrix factorisation methods decompose multivariate observations as linear combinations of latent feature vectors. The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) provides a way to model the number of latent features required for a good approximation in terms of regularised reconstruction error. Previous work has focussed on latent feature vectors with independent entries. We extend the model to include nondiagonal latent covariance structures representing characteristics such as smoothness. This is done by . Using simulations we demonstrate that under appropriate conditions a smoothness prior helps to recover the true latent features, while denoising more accurately. We demonstrate our method on a real neuroimaging dataset, where computational tractability is a sufficient challenge that the efficient strategy presented here is essential.	Infinite Sparse Structured Factor Analysis
1210.5806v1	Multi-task sparse feature learning aims to improve the generalization performance by exploiting the shared features among tasks. It has been successfully applied to many applications including computer vision and biomedical informatics. Most of the existing multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms are formulated as a convex sparse regularization problem, which is usually suboptimal, due to its looseness for approximating an $\ell_0$-type regularizer. In this paper, we propose a non-convex formulation for multi-task sparse feature learning based on a novel non-convex regularizer. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning (MSMTFL) algorithm; we also provide intuitive interpretations, detailed convergence and reproducibility analysis for the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we present a detailed theoretical analysis showing that MSMTFL achieves a better parameter estimation error bound than the convex formulation. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of MSMTFL in comparison with the state of the art multi-task sparse feature learning algorithms.	Multi-Stage Multi-Task Feature Learning
1611.07051v3	There is a widespread need for techniques that can discover structure from time series data. Recently introduced techniques such as Automatic Bayesian Covariance Discovery (ABCD) provide a way to find structure within a single time series by searching through a space of covariance kernels that is generated using a simple grammar. While ABCD can identify a broad class of temporal patterns, it is difficult to extend and can be brittle in practice. This paper shows how to extend ABCD by formulating it in terms of probabilistic program synthesis. The key technical ideas are to (i) represent models using abstract syntax trees for a domain-specific probabilistic language, and (ii) represent the time series model prior, likelihood, and search strategy using probabilistic programs in a sufficiently expressive language. The final probabilistic program is written in under 70 lines of probabilistic code in Venture. The paper demonstrates an application to time series clustering that involves a non-parametric extension to ABCD, experiments for interpolation and extrapolation on real-world econometric data, and improvements in accuracy over both non-parametric and standard regression baselines.	Time Series Structure Discovery via Probabilistic Program Synthesis
1209.4360v4	Mean-field variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference in many probabilistic models. In a typical application, mean-field methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest---like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression---are nonconjuate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.	Variational Inference in Nonconjugate Models
1202.3761v1	Kernel methods are successful approaches for different machine learning problems. This success is mainly rooted in using feature maps and kernel matrices. Some methods rely on the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of the kernel matrix, while for other methods the spectral information can be used to estimate the excess risk. An important question remains on how close the sample eigenvalues/eigenvectors are to the population values. In this paper, we improve earlier results on concentration bounds for eigenvalues of general kernel matrices. For distance and inner product kernel functions, e.g. radial basis functions, we provide new concentration bounds, which are characterized by the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix. Meanwhile, the obstacles for sharper bounds are accounted for and partially addressed. As a case study, we derive a concentration inequality for sample kernel target-alignment.

1603.07593v2	How does one objectively measure the performance of an individual offensive lineman in the NFL? The existing literature proposes various measures that rely on subjective assessments of game film, but has yet to develop an objective methodology to evaluate performance. Using a variety of statistics related to an offensive lineman's performance, we develop a framework to objectively analyze the overall performance of an individual offensive lineman and determine specific linemen who are overvalued or undervalued relative to their salary. We identify eight players across the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 NFL seasons that are considered to be overvalued or undervalued and corroborate the results with existing metrics that are based on subjective evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, the techniques set forth in this work have not been utilized in previous works to evaluate the performance of NFL players at any position, including offensive linemen.

1206.0333v1	We study the problem of estimating multiple predictive functions from a dictionary of basis functions in the nonparametric regression setting. Our estimation scheme assumes that each predictive function can be estimated in the form of a linear combination of the basis functions. By assuming that the coefficient matrix admits a sparse low-rank structure, we formulate the function estimation problem as a convex program regularized by the trace norm and the $\ell_1$-norm simultaneously. We propose to solve the convex program using the accelerated gradient (AG) method and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) respectively; we also develop efficient algorithms to solve the key components in both AG and ADMM. In addition, we conduct theoretical analysis on the proposed function estimation scheme: we derive a key property of the optimal solution to the convex program; based on an assumption on the basis functions, we establish a performance bound of the proposed function estimation scheme (via the composite regularization). Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.	Sparse Trace Norm Regularization
1011.5142v1	In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for subagged estimators, both for classification and regressor. General loss functions and class of predictors with both finite and infinite VC-dimension are considered. We slightly generalize the formalism introduced by \cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$-fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\upsilon$-out cross-validation. \bigskip \noindent An interesting consequence is that the probability upper bound is bounded by the minimum of a Hoeffding-type bound and a Vapnik-type bounds, and thus is smaller than 1 even for small learning set. Finally, we give a simple rule on how to subbag the predictor. \bigskip	Estimating Subagging by cross-validation
1408.5032v1	A large number of algorithms in machine learning, from principal component analysis (PCA), and its non-linear (kernel) extensions, to more recent spectral embedding and support estimation methods, rely on estimating a linear subspace from samples. In this paper we introduce a general formulation of this problem and derive novel learning error estimates. Our results rely on natural assumptions on the spectral properties of the covariance operator associated to the data distribu- tion, and hold for a wide class of metrics between subspaces. As special cases, we discuss sharp error estimates for the reconstruction properties of PCA and spectral support estimation. Key to our analysis is an operator theoretic approach that has broad applicability to spectral learning methods.	On the Sample Complexity of Subspace Learning
1512.05287v5	Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) stand at the forefront of many recent developments in deep learning. Yet a major difficulty with these models is their tendency to overfit, with dropout shown to fail when applied to recurrent layers. Recent results at the intersection of Bayesian modelling and deep learning offer a Bayesian interpretation of common deep learning techniques such as dropout. This grounding of dropout in approximate Bayesian inference suggests an extension of the theoretical results, offering insights into the use of dropout with RNN models. We apply this new variational inference based dropout technique in LSTM and GRU models, assessing it on language modelling and sentiment analysis tasks. The new approach outperforms existing techniques, and to the best of our knowledge improves on the single model state-of-the-art in language modelling with the Penn Treebank (73.4 test perplexity). This extends our arsenal of variational tools in deep learning.	A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural  Networks
1104.3667v1	The aim of the present paper is to develop a strategy for solving reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problems that remains applicable when the performance models are expensive to evaluate. Starting with the premise that simulation-based approaches are not affordable for such problems, and that the most-probable-failure-point-based approaches do not permit to quantify the error on the estimation of the failure probability, an approach based on both metamodels and advanced simulation techniques is explored. The kriging metamodeling technique is chosen in order to surrogate the performance functions because it allows one to genuinely quantify the surrogate error. The surrogate error onto the limit-state surfaces is propagated to the failure probabilities estimates in order to provide an empirical error measure. This error is then sequentially reduced by means of a population-based adaptive refinement technique until the kriging surrogates are accurate enough for reliability analysis. This original refinement strategy makes it possible to add several observations in the design of experiments at the same time. Reliability and reliability sensitivity analyses are performed by means of the subset simulation technique for the sake of numerical efficiency. The adaptive surrogate-based strategy for reliability estimation is finally involved into a classical gradient-based optimization algorithm in order to solve the RBDO problem. The kriging surrogates are built in a so-called augmented reliability space thus making them reusable from one nested RBDO iteration to the other. The strategy is compared to other approaches available in the literature on three academic examples in the field of structural mechanics.

1703.10010v1	The trade-off between the cost of acquiring and processing data, and uncertainty due to a lack of data is fundamental in machine learning. A basic instance of this trade-off is the problem of deciding when to make noisy and costly observations of a discrete-time Gaussian random walk, so as to minimise the posterior variance plus observation costs. We present the first proof that a simple policy, which observes when the posterior variance exceeds a threshold, is optimal for this problem. The proof generalises to a wide range of cost functions other than the posterior variance. This result implies that optimal policies for linear-quadratic-Gaussian control with costly observations have a threshold structure. It also implies that the restless bandit problem of observing multiple such time series, has a well-defined Whittle index. We discuss computation of that index, give closed-form formulae for it, and compare the performance of the associated index policy with heuristic policies. The proof is based on a new verification theorem that demonstrates threshold structure for Markov decision processes, and on the relation between binary sequences known as mechanical words and the dynamics of discontinuous nonlinear maps, which frequently arise in physics, control and biology.	Optimal Policies for Observing Time Series and Related Restless Bandit  Problems
1611.07663v1	Decision makers, such as doctors and judges, make crucial decisions such as recommending treatments to patients, and granting bails to defendants on a daily basis. Such decisions typically involve weighting the potential benefits of taking an action against the costs involved. In this work, we aim to automate this task of learning {cost-effective, interpretable and actionable treatment regimes. We formulate this as a problem of learning a decision list -- a sequence of if-then-else rules -- which maps characteristics of subjects (eg., diagnostic test results of patients) to treatments. We propose a novel objective to construct a decision list which maximizes outcomes for the population, and minimizes overall costs. We model the problem of learning such a list as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a variant of the Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy which leverages customized checks for pruning the search space effectively. Experimental results on real world observational data capturing treatment recommendations for asthma patients demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

1301.1954v5	"Suppose that two large, multi-dimensional data sets are each noisy measurements of the same underlying random process, and principle components analysis is performed separately on the data sets to reduce their dimensionality. In some circumstances it may happen that the two lower-dimensional data sets have an inordinately large Procrustean fitting-error between them. The purpose of this manuscript is to quantify this ""incommensurability phenomenon."" In particular, under specified conditions, the square Procrustean fitting-error of the two normalized lower-dimensional data sets is (asymptotically) a convex combination (via a correlation parameter) of the Hausdorff distance between the projection subspaces and the maximum possible value of the square Procrustean fitting-error for normalized data. We show how this gives rise to the incommensurability phenomenon, and we employ illustrative simulations as well as a real data experiment to explore how the incommensurability phenomenon may have an appreciable impact."

1501.00725v1	We consider the problem of unveiling the implicit network structure of user interactions in a social network, based only on high-frequency timestamps. Our inference is based on the minimization of the least-squares loss associated with a multivariate Hawkes model, penalized by $\ell_1$ and trace norms. We provide a first theoretical analysis of the generalization error for this problem, that includes sparsity and low-rank inducing priors. This result involves a new data-driven concentration inequality for matrix martingales in continuous time with observable variance, which is a result of independent interest. A consequence of our analysis is the construction of sharply tuned $\ell_1$ and trace-norm penalizations, that leads to a data-driven scaling of the variability of information available for each users. Numerical experiments illustrate the strong improvements achieved by the use of such data-driven penalizations.	A generalization error bound for sparse and low-rank multivariate Hawkes  processes
1708.01947v1	We consider the problem of estimating a regression function in the common situation where the number of features is small, where interpretability of the model is a high priority, and where simple linear or additive models fail to provide adequate performance. To address this problem, we present Maximum Variance Total Variation denoising (MVTV), an approach that is conceptually related both to CART and to the more recent CRISP algorithm, a state-of-the-art alternative method for interpretable nonlinear regression. MVTV divides the feature space into blocks of constant value and fits the value of all blocks jointly via a convex optimization routine. Our method is fully data-adaptive, in that it incorporates highly robust routines for tuning all hyperparameters automatically. We compare our approach against CART and CRISP via both a complexity-accuracy tradeoff metric and a human study, demonstrating that that MVTV is a more powerful and interpretable method.

1611.00565v2	Semi-supervised and unsupervised systems provide operators with invaluable support and can tremendously reduce the operators load. In the light of the necessity to process large volumes of video data and provide autonomous decisions, this work proposes new learning algorithms for activity analysis in video. The activities and behaviours are described by a dynamic topic model. Two novel learning algorithms based on the expectation maximisation approach and variational Bayes inference are proposed. Theoretical derivations of the posterior of model parameters are given. The designed learning algorithms are compared with the Gibbs sampling inference scheme introduced earlier in the literature. A detailed comparison of the learning algorithms is presented on real video data. We also propose an anomaly localisation procedure, elegantly embedded in the topic modeling framework. The proposed framework can be applied to a number of areas, including transportation systems, security and surveillance.	Learning Methods for Dynamic Topic Modeling in Automated Behaviour  Analysis
1611.10073v2	The construction of synthetic complex-valued signals from real-valued observations is an important step in many time series analysis techniques. The most widely used approach is based on the Hilbert transform, which maps the real-valued signal into its quadrature component. In this paper, we define a probabilistic generalization of this approach. We model the observable real-valued signal as the real part of a latent complex-valued Gaussian process. In order to obtain the appropriate statistical relationship between its real and imaginary parts, we define two new classes of complex-valued covariance functions. Through an analysis of simulated chirplets and stochastic oscillations, we show that the resulting Gaussian process complex-valued signal provides a better estimate of the instantaneous amplitude and frequency than the established approaches. Furthermore, the complex-valued Gaussian process regression allows to incorporate prior information about the structure in signal and noise and thereby to tailor the analysis to the features of the signal. As a example, we analyze the non-stationary dynamics of brain oscillations in the alpha band, as measured using magneto-encephalography.	Complex-valued Gaussian Process Regression for Time Series Analysis
1605.05349v1	We present a method based on the orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix tri-factorization of the normalized Laplacian matrix for community detection in complex networks. While the exact factorization of a given order may not exist and is NP hard to compute, we obtain an approximate factorization by solving an optimization problem. We establish the connection of the factors obtained through the factorization to a non-negative basis of an invariant subspace of the estimated matrix, drawing parallel with the spectral clustering. Using such factorization for clustering in networks is motivated by analyzing a block-diagonal Laplacian matrix with the blocks representing the connected components of a graph. The method is shown to be consistent for community detection in graphs generated from the stochastic block model and the degree corrected stochastic block model. Simulation results and real data analysis show the effectiveness of these methods under a wide variety of situations, including sparse and highly heterogeneous graphs where the usual spectral clustering is known to fail. Our method also performs better than the state of the art in popular benchmark network datasets, e.g., the political web blogs and the karate club data.	Orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix factorization under the  stochastic block model
0707.0303v1	In most papers establishing consistency for learning algorithms it is assumed that the observations used for training are realizations of an i.i.d. process. In this paper we go far beyond this classical framework by showing that support vector machines (SVMs) essentially only require that the data-generating process satisfies a certain law of large numbers. We then consider the learnability of SVMs for $\a$-mixing (not necessarily stationary) processes for both classification and regression, where for the latter we explicitly allow unbounded noise.	Learning from dependent observations
1610.00907v1	Gaussian processes are powerful, yet analytically tractable models for supervised learning. A Gaussian process is characterized by a mean function and a covariance function (kernel), which are determined by a model selection criterion. The functions to be compared do not just differ in their parametrization but in their fundamental structure. It is often not clear which function structure to choose, for instance to decide between a squared exponential and a rational quadratic kernel. Based on the principle of approximation set coding, we develop a framework for model selection to rank kernels for Gaussian process regression. In our experiments approximation set coding shows promise to become a model selection criterion competitive with maximum evidence (also called marginal likelihood) and leave-one-out cross-validation.	Model Selection for Gaussian Process Regression by Approximation Set  Coding
1509.06061v1	In this paper we develop a statistical theory and an implementation of deep learning models. We show that an elegant variable splitting scheme for the alternating direction method of multipliers optimises a deep learning objective. We allow for non-smooth non-convex regularisation penalties to induce sparsity in parameter weights. We provide a link between traditional shallow layer statistical models such as principal component and sliced inverse regression and deep layer models. We also define the degrees of freedom of a deep learning predictor and a predictive MSE criteria to perform model selection for comparing architecture designs. We focus on deep multiclass logistic learning although our methods apply more generally. Our results suggest an interesting and previously under-exploited relationship between deep learning and proximal splitting techniques. To illustrate our methodology, we provide a multi-class logit classification analysis of Fisher's Iris data where we illustrate the convergence of our algorithm. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.	A Statistical Theory of Deep Learning via Proximal Splitting
1406.5986v2	We consider statistical as well as algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. For a LS problem with input data $(X, Y) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p} \times \mathbb{R}^n$, sketching algorithms use a sketching matrix, $S\in\mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ with $r \ll n$. Then, rather than solving the LS problem using the full data $(X,Y)$, sketching algorithms solve the LS problem using only the sketched data $(SX, SY)$. Prior work has typically adopted an algorithmic perspective, in that it has made no statistical assumptions on the input $X$ and $Y$, and instead it has been assumed that the data $(X,Y)$ are fixed and worst-case (WC). Prior results show that, when using sketching matrices such as random projections and leverage-score sampling algorithms, with $p < r \ll n$, the WC error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a small constant. From a statistical perspective, we typically consider the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data $(X, Y)$ are generated according to a statistical model $Y = X \beta + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a noise process. We provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling sketching algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $p < r \ll n$ while the PE typically requires the sample size $r$ to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent results show that our upper bounds on PE can not be improved.	A Statistical Perspective on Randomized Sketching for Ordinary  Least-Squares
1706.05612v2	The two-sample hypothesis testing problem is studied for the challenging scenario of high dimensional data sets with small sample sizes. We show that the two-sample hypothesis testing problem can be posed as a one-class set classification problem. In the set classification problem the goal is to classify a set of data points that are assumed to have a common class. We prove that the average probability of error given a set is less than or equal to the Bayes error and decreases as a power of $n$ number of sample data points in the set. We use the positive definite Set Kernel for directly mapping sets of data to an associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, without the need to learn a probability distribution. We specifically solve the two-sample hypothesis testing problem using a one-class SVM in conjunction with the proposed Set Kernel. We compare the proposed method with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy, F-Test and T-Test methods on a number of challenging simulated high dimensional and small sample size data. We also perform two-sample hypothesis testing experiments on six cancer gene expression data sets and achieve zero type-I and type-II error results on all data sets.

1503.01494v1	We introduce local expectation gradients which is a general purpose stochastic variational inference algorithm for constructing stochastic gradients through sampling from the variational distribution. This algorithm divides the problem of estimating the stochastic gradients over multiple variational parameters into smaller sub-tasks so that each sub-task exploits intelligently the information coming from the most relevant part of the variational distribution. This is achieved by performing an exact expectation over the single random variable that mostly correlates with the variational parameter of interest resulting in a Rao-Blackwellized estimate that has low variance and can work efficiently for both continuous and discrete random variables. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has interesting similarities with Gibbs sampling but at the same time, unlike Gibbs sampling, it can be trivially parallelized.

1701.06597v1	We consider the demixing problem of two (or more) high-dimensional vectors from nonlinear observations when the number of such observations is far less than the ambient dimension of the underlying vectors. Specifically, we demonstrate an algorithm that stably estimate the underlying components under general \emph{structured sparsity} assumptions on these components. Specifically, we show that for certain types of structured superposition models, our method provably recovers the components given merely $n = \mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$ denotes the number of nonzero entries in the underlying components. Moreover, our method achieves a fast (linear) convergence rate, and also exhibits fast (near-linear) per-iteration complexity for certain types of structured models. We also provide a range of simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.	Iterative Thresholding for Demixing Structured Superpositions in High  Dimensions
1009.1318v1	This paper proposes an organized generalization of Newman and Girvan's modularity measure for graph clustering. Optimized via a deterministic annealing scheme, this measure produces topologically ordered graph clusterings that lead to faithful and readable graph representations based on clustering induced graphs. Topographic graph clustering provides an alternative to more classical solutions in which a standard graph clustering method is applied to build a simpler graph that is then represented with a graph layout algorithm. A comparative study on four real world graphs ranging from 34 to 1 133 vertices shows the interest of the proposed approach with respect to classical solutions and to self-organizing maps for graphs.

1511.03243v3	Black-box alpha (BB-$\alpha$) is a new approximate inference method based on the minimization of $\alpha$-divergences. BB-$\alpha$ scales to large datasets because it can be implemented using stochastic gradient descent. BB-$\alpha$ can be applied to complex probabilistic models with little effort since it only requires as input the likelihood function and its gradients. These gradients can be easily obtained using automatic differentiation. By changing the divergence parameter $\alpha$, the method is able to interpolate between variational Bayes (VB) ($\alpha \rightarrow 0$) and an algorithm similar to expectation propagation (EP) ($\alpha = 1$). Experiments on probit regression and neural network regression and classification problems show that BB-$\alpha$ with non-standard settings of $\alpha$, such as $\alpha = 0.5$, usually produces better predictions than with $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ (VB) or $\alpha = 1$ (EP).

1709.04862v1	Assessing heterogeneous treatment effects has become a growing interest in advancing precision medicine. Individualized treatment effects (ITE) play a critical role in such an endeavor. Concerning experimental data collected from randomized trials, we put forward a method, termed random forests of interaction trees (RFIT), for estimating ITE on the basis of interaction trees (Su et al., 2009). To this end, we first propose a smooth sigmoid surrogate (SSS) method, as an alternative to greedy search, to speed up tree construction. RFIT outperforms the traditional `separate regression' approach in estimating ITE. Furthermore, standard errors for the estimated ITE via RFIT can be obtained with the infinitesimal jackknife method. We assess and illustrate the use of RFIT via both simulation and the analysis of data from an acupuncture headache trial.

0806.4115v4	We propose a new sparsity-smoothness penalty for high-dimensional generalized additive models. The combination of sparsity and smoothness is crucial for mathematical theory as well as performance for finite-sample data. We present a computationally efficient algorithm, with provable numerical convergence properties, for optimizing the penalized likelihood. Furthermore, we provide oracle results which yield asymptotic optimality of our estimator for high dimensional but sparse additive models. Finally, an adaptive version of our sparsity-smoothness penalized approach yields large additional performance gains.	High-dimensional additive modeling
1504.05434v1	We consider two connected aspects of maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter for high-dimensional discrete graphical models: the existence of the maximum likelihood estimate (mle) and its computation. When the data is sparse, there are many zeros in the contingency table and the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter may not exist. Fienberg and Rinaldo (2012) have shown that the mle does not exists iff the data vector belongs to a face of the so-called marginal cone spanned by the rows of the design matrix of the model. Identifying these faces in high-dimension is challenging. In this paper, we take a local approach : we show that one such face, albeit possibly not the smallest one, can be identified by looking at a collection of marginal graphical models generated by induced subgraphs $G_i,i=1,\ldots,k$ of $G$. This is our first contribution. Our second contribution concerns the composite maximum likelihood estimate. When the dimension of the problem is large, estimating the parameters of a given graphical model through maximum likelihood is challenging, if not impossible. The traditional approach to this problem has been local with the use of composite likelihood based on local conditional likelihoods. A more recent development is to have the components of the composite likelihood be marginal likelihoods centred around each $v$. We first show that the estimates obtained by consensus through local conditional and marginal likelihoods are identical. We then study the asymptotic properties of the composite maximum likelihood estimate when both the dimension of the model and the sample size $N$ go to infinity.	A local approach to estimation in discrete loglinear models
1703.09165v1	The development of computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction methods that significantly reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining high image quality is an important area of research in low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging. We propose a new penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) reconstruction method that exploits regularization based on an efficient Union of Learned TRAnsforms (PWLS-ULTRA). The union of square transforms is pre-learned from numerous image patches extracted from a dataset of CT images or volumes. The proposed PWLS-based cost function is optimized by alternating between an image update step, and a sparse coding and clustering step. The CT image update step is accelerated by a relaxed linearized augmented Lagrangian method with ordered-subsets that reduces the number of forward and backward projections. Simulations with 2D and 3D axial CT scans of the XCAT phantom and 3D helical chest scans show that for low-dose levels, the proposed method significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images compared to PWLS reconstruction with a nonadaptive edge-preserving regularizer (PWLS-EP). PWLS with regularization based on a union of learned transforms leads to better image reconstructions than using a single learned square transform or a learned overcomplete synthesis dictionary. We also incorporate patch-based weights in PWLS-ULTRA that enhance image quality and help improve image resolution uniformity.

1203.3532v1	Graphical models are widely used in scienti fic and engineering research to represent conditional independence structures between random variables. In many controlled experiments, environmental changes or external stimuli can often alter the conditional dependence between the random variables, and potentially produce significant structural changes in the corresponding graphical models. Therefore, it is of great importance to be able to detect such structural changes from data, so as to gain novel insights into where and how the structural changes take place and help the system adapt to the new environment. Here we report an effective learning strategy to extract structural changes in Gaussian graphical model using l1-regularization based convex optimization. We discuss the properties of the problem formulation and introduce an efficient implementation by the block coordinate descent algorithm. We demonstrate the principle of the approach on a numerical simulation experiment, and we then apply the algorithm to the modeling of gene regulatory networks under different conditions and obtain promising yet biologically plausible results.

1609.07410v2	The softmax representation of probabilities for categorical variables plays a prominent role in modern machine learning with numerous applications in areas such as large scale classification, neural language modeling and recommendation systems. However, softmax estimation is very expensive for large scale inference because of the high cost associated with computing the normalizing constant. Here, we introduce an efficient approximation to softmax probabilities which takes the form of a rigorous lower bound on the exact probability. This bound is expressed as a product over pairwise probabilities and it leads to scalable estimation based on stochastic optimization. It allows us to perform doubly stochastic estimation by subsampling both training instances and class labels. We show that the new bound has interesting theoretical properties and we demonstrate its use in classification problems.	One-vs-Each Approximation to Softmax for Scalable Estimation of  Probabilities
1302.5134v1	Spectral clustering (SC) and graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms are sensitive to how graphs are constructed from data. In particular if the data has proximal and unbalanced clusters these algorithms can lead to poor performance on well-known graphs such as $k$-NN, full-RBF, $\epsilon$-graphs. This is because the objectives such as Ratio-Cut (RCut) or normalized cut (NCut) attempt to tradeoff cut values with cluster sizes, which are not tailored to unbalanced data. We propose a novel graph partitioning framework, which parameterizes a family of graphs by adaptively modulating node degrees in a $k$-NN graph. We then propose a model selection scheme to choose sizable clusters which are separated by smallest cut values. Our framework is able to adapt to varying levels of unbalancedness of data and can be naturally used for small cluster detection. We theoretically justify our ideas through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method.	Spectral Clustering with Unbalanced Data
1509.04541v1	We study the restless bandit associated with an extremely simple scalar Kalman filter model in discrete time. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the problem is indexable in the sense that the Whittle index is a non-decreasing function of the relevant belief state. In spite of the long history of this problem, this appears to be the first such proof. We use results about Schur-convexity and mechanical words, which are particular binary strings intimately related to palindromes.	When are Kalman-filter restless bandits indexable?
0804.1026v1	We propose to investigate test statistics for testing homogeneity in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Asymptotic null distributions under null hypothesis are derived, and consistency against fixed and local alternatives is assessed. Finally, experimental evidence of the performance of the proposed approach on both artificial data and a speaker verification task is provided.	Testing for Homogeneity with Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis
1204.6703v4	The problem of topic modeling can be seen as a generalization of the clustering problem, in that it posits that observations are generated due to multiple latent factors (e.g., the words in each document are generated as a mixture of several active topics, as opposed to just one). This increased representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem of estimating the topic probability vectors (the distributions over words for each topic), when only the words are observed and the corresponding topics are hidden. We provide a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed to recover the parameters for a wide class of mixture models, including the popular latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. For LDA, the procedure correctly recovers both the topic probability vectors and the prior over the topics, using only trigram statistics (i.e., third order moments, which may be estimated with documents containing just three words). The method, termed Excess Correlation Analysis (ECA), is based on a spectral decomposition of low order moments (third and fourth order) via two singular value decompositions (SVDs). Moreover, the algorithm is scalable since the SVD operations are carried out on $k\times k$ matrices, where $k$ is the number of latent factors (e.g. the number of topics), rather than in the $d$-dimensional observed space (typically $d \gg k$).

1108.1483v2	We propose a novel algebraic framework for treating probability distributions represented by their cumulants such as the mean and covariance matrix. As an example, we consider the unsupervised learning problem of finding the subspace on which several probability distributions agree. Instead of minimizing an objective function involving the estimated cumulants, we show that by treating the cumulants as elements of the polynomial ring we can directly solve the problem, at a lower computational cost and with higher accuracy. Moreover, the algebraic viewpoint on probability distributions allows us to invoke the theory of Algebraic Geometry, which we demonstrate in a compact proof for an identifiability criterion.

1607.03792v1	"We study the density estimation problem with observations generated by certain dynamical systems that admit a unique underlying invariant Lebesgue density. Observations drawn from dynamical systems are not independent and moreover, usual mixing concepts may not be appropriate for measuring the dependence among these observations. By employing the $\mathcal{C}$-mixing concept to measure the dependence, we conduct statistical analysis on the consistency and convergence of the kernel density estimator. Our main results are as follows: First, we show that with properly chosen bandwidth, the kernel density estimator is universally consistent under $L_1$-norm; Second, we establish convergence rates for the estimator with respect to several classes of dynamical systems under $L_1$-norm. In the analysis, the density function $f$ is only assumed to be H\""{o}lder continuous which is a weak assumption in the literature of nonparametric density estimation and also more realistic in the dynamical system context. Last but not least, we prove that the same convergence rates of the estimator under $L_\infty$-norm and $L_1$-norm can be achieved when the density function is H\""{o}lder continuous, compactly supported and bounded. The bandwidth selection problem of the kernel density estimator for dynamical system is also discussed in our study via numerical simulations."	Kernel Density Estimation for Dynamical Systems
1603.02443v2	"This note compares two recently published machine learning methods for constructing flexible, but tractable families of variational hidden-variable posteriors.

1102.4548v2	We propose an active set selection framework for Gaussian process classification for cases when the dataset is large enough to render its inference prohibitive. Our scheme consists of a two step alternating procedure of active set update rules and hyperparameter optimization based upon marginal likelihood maximization. The active set update rules rely on the ability of the predictive distributions of a Gaussian process classifier to estimate the relative contribution of a datapoint when being either included or removed from the model. This means that we can use it to include points with potentially high impact to the classifier decision process while removing those that are less relevant. We introduce two active set rules based on different criteria, the first one prefers a model with interpretable active set parameters whereas the second puts computational complexity first, thus a model with active set parameters that directly control its complexity. We also provide both theoretical and empirical support for our active set selection strategy being a good approximation of a full Gaussian process classifier. Our extensive experiments show that our approach can compete with state-of-the-art classification techniques with reasonable time complexity.

1106.4355v3	Standard compressive sensing results state that to exactly recover an s sparse signal in R^p, one requires O(s. log(p)) measurements. While this bound is extremely useful in practice, often real world signals are not only sparse, but also exhibit structure in the sparsity pattern. We focus on group-structured patterns in this paper. Under this model, groups of signal coefficients are active (or inactive) together. The groups are predefined, but the particular set of groups that are active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show that exploiting knowledge of groups can further reduce the number of measurements required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds for the number of measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that it only depends on the number of groups under consideration, and not the particulars of the groups (e.g., compositions, sizes, extents, overlaps, etc.). Experiments show that our result holds for a variety of overlapping group configurations.	Tight Measurement Bounds for Exact Recovery of Structured Sparse Signals
1703.09207v2	Objectives: Discussions of fairness in criminal justice risk assessments typically lack conceptual precision. Rhetoric too often substitutes for careful analysis. In this paper, we seek to clarify the tradeoffs between different kinds of fairness and between fairness and accuracy. Methods: We draw on the existing literatures in criminology, computer science and statistics to provide an integrated examination of fairness and accuracy in criminal justice risk assessments. We also provide an empirical illustration using data from arraignments. Results: We show that there are at least six kinds of fairness, some of which are incompatible with one another and with accuracy. Conclusions: Except in trivial cases, it is impossible to maximize accuracy and fairness at the same time, and impossible simultaneously to satisfy all kinds of fairness. In practice, a major complication is different base rates across different legally protected groups. There is a need to consider challenging tradeoffs.

1610.05275v1	We propose a unified framework for estimating low-rank matrices through nonconvex optimization based on gradient descent algorithm. Our framework is quite general and can be applied to both noisy and noiseless observations. In the general case with noisy observations, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix up to minimax optimal statistical error, provided an appropriate initial estimator. While in the generic noiseless setting, our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate and enables exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. In addition, we develop a new initialization algorithm to provide a desired initial estimator, which outperforms existing initialization algorithms for nonconvex low-rank matrix estimation. We illustrate the superiority of our framework through three examples: matrix regression, matrix completion, and one-bit matrix completion. We also corroborate our theory through extensive experiments on synthetic data.	A Unified Computational and Statistical Framework for Nonconvex Low-Rank  Matrix Estimation
1712.09641v1	A novel quantile Fourier neural network is presented for nonparametric probabilistic forecasting. Prediction are provided in the form of composite quantiles using time as the only input to the model. This effectively is a form of extrapolation based quantile regression applied for forecasting. Empirical results showcase that for time series data that have clear seasonality and trend, the model provides high quality probabilistic predictions. This work introduces a new class of forecasting of using only time as the input versus using past data such as an autoregressive model. Extrapolation based regression has not been studied before for probabilistic forecasting.	A Composite Quantile Fourier Neural Network for Multi-Horizon  Probabilistic Forecasting
1505.04780v2	We present a unified framework for low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties. We first prove that the proposed estimator attains a faster statistical rate than the traditional low-rank matrix estimator with nuclear norm penalty. Moreover, we rigorously show that under a certain condition on the magnitude of the nonzero singular values, the proposed estimator enjoys oracle property (i.e., exactly recovers the true rank of the matrix), besides attaining a faster rate. As far as we know, this is the first work that establishes the theory of low-rank matrix estimation with nonconvex penalties, confirming the advantages of nonconvex penalties for matrix completion. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets corroborate our theory.	Towards Faster Rates and Oracle Property for Low-Rank Matrix Estimation
1509.02438v1	Online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning is a class of online margin-based algorithms suitable for a wide range of real-time prediction tasks, including classification and regression. PA algorithms are formulated in terms of deterministic point-estimation problems governed by a set of user-defined hyperparameters: the approach fails to capture model/prediction uncertainty and makes their performance highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. In this paper, we introduce a novel PA learning framework for regression that overcomes the above limitations. We contribute a Bayesian state-space interpretation of PA regression, along with a novel online variational inference scheme, that not only produces probabilistic predictions, but also offers the benefit of automatic hyperparameter tuning. Experiments with various real-world data sets show that our approach performs significantly better than a more standard, linear Gaussian state-space model.

1707.00102v1	When devising a course of treatment for a patient, doctors often have little quantitative evidence on which to base their decisions, beyond their medical education and published clinical trials. Stanford Health Care alone has millions of electronic medical records (EMRs) that are only just recently being leveraged to inform better treatment recommendations. These data present a unique challenge because they are high-dimensional and observational. Our goal is to make personalized treatment recommendations based on the outcomes for past patients similar to a new patient. We propose and analyze three methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using observational data. Our methods perform well in simulations using a wide variety of treatment effect functions, and we present results of applying the two most promising methods to data from The SPRINT Data Analysis Challenge, from a large randomized trial of a treatment for high blood pressure.

1106.4487v1	This paper presents Natural Evolution Strategies (NES), a recent family of algorithms that constitute a more principled approach to black-box optimization than established evolutionary algorithms. NES maintains a parameterized distribution on the set of solution candidates, and the natural gradient is used to update the distribution's parameters in the direction of higher expected fitness. We introduce a collection of techniques that address issues of convergence, robustness, sample complexity, computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. This paper explores a number of implementations of the NES family, ranging from general-purpose multi-variate normal distributions to heavy-tailed and separable distributions tailored towards global optimization and search in high dimensional spaces, respectively. Experimental results show best published performance on various standard benchmarks, as well as competitive performance on others.	Natural Evolution Strategies
1611.03531v2	The vision for precision medicine is to use individual patient characteristics to inform a personalized treatment plan that leads to the best healthcare possible for each patient. Mobile technologies have an important role to play in this vision as they offer a means to monitor a patient's health status in real-time and subsequently to deliver interventions if, when, and in the dose that they are needed. Dynamic treatment regimes formalize individualized treatment plans as sequences of decision rules, one per stage of clinical intervention, that map current patient information to a recommended treatment. However, existing methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes are designed for a small number of fixed decision points occurring on a coarse time-scale. We propose a new reinforcement learning method for estimating an optimal treatment regime that is applicable to data collected using mobile technologies in an outpatient setting. The proposed method accommodates an indefinite time horizon and minute-by-minute decision making that are common in mobile health applications. We show the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. The proposed methods are applied to estimate an optimal dynamic treatment regime for controlling blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes.	Estimating Dynamic Treatment Regimes in Mobile Health Using V-learning
1602.02964v4	We propose a nonparametric statistical test for goodness-of-fit: given a set of samples, the test determines how likely it is that these were generated from a target density function. The measure of goodness-of-fit is a divergence constructed via Stein's method using functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our test statistic is based on an empirical estimate of this divergence, taking the form of a V-statistic in terms of the log gradients of the target density and the kernel. We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure. We apply our test to quantifying convergence of approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, statistical model criticism, and evaluating quality of fit vs model complexity in nonparametric density estimation.	A Kernel Test of Goodness of Fit
1312.6317v2	In this paper, we propose an outlier-robust regularized kernel-based method for linear system identification. The unknown impulse response is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) is given by the recently proposed stable spline kernel, which encodes information on regularity and exponential stability. To build robustness to outliers, we model the measurement noise as realizations of independent Laplacian random variables. The identification problem is cast in a Bayesian framework, and solved by a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme. In particular, exploiting the representation of the Laplacian random variables as scale mixtures of Gaussians, we design a Gibbs sampler which quickly converges to the target distribution. Numerical simulations show a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the estimates over state-of-the-art kernel-based methods.	Outlier robust system identification: a Bayesian kernel-based approach
1802.05842v1	While most classical approaches to Granger causality detection assume linear dynamics, many interactions in applied domains, like neuroscience and genomics, are inherently nonlinear. In these cases, using linear models may lead to inconsistent estimation of Granger causal interactions. We propose a class of nonlinear methods by applying structured multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) combined with sparsity-inducing penalties on the weights. By encouraging specific sets of weights to be zero---in particular through the use of convex group-lasso penalties---we can extract the Granger causal structure. To further contrast with traditional approaches, our framework naturally enables us to efficiently capture long-range dependencies between series either via our RNNs or through an automatic lag selection in the MLP. We show that our neural Granger causality methods outperform state-of-the-art nonlinear Granger causality methods on the DREAM3 challenge data. This data consists of nonlinear gene expression and regulation time courses with only a limited number of time points. The successes we show in this challenging dataset provide a powerful example of how deep learning can be useful in cases that go beyond prediction on large datasets. We likewise demonstrate our methods in detecting nonlinear interactions in a human motion capture dataset.	Neural Granger Causality for Nonlinear Time Series
1706.00292v3	The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions (i.e. two probability distributions supported on two distinct low-dimensional manifolds living in a much higher-dimensional space) is a crucial problem arising in the estimation of generative models for high-dimensional observations such as those arising in computer vision or natural language. It is known that optimal transport metrics can represent a cure for this problem, since they were specifically designed as an alternative to information divergences to handle such problematic scenarios. Unfortunately, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational burden of evaluating OT losses, (ii) the instability and lack of smoothness of these losses, (iii) the difficulty to estimate robustly these losses and their gradients in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable computational method to train large scale generative models using an optimal transport loss, and tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into one that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations. These two approximations result in a robust and differentiable approximation of the OT loss with streamlined GPU execution. Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD which comes with unbiased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function.	Learning Generative Models with Sinkhorn Divergences
1209.3431v2	We consider the problems of detection and localization of a contiguous block of weak activation in a large matrix, from a small number of noisy, possibly adaptive, compressive (linear) measurements. This is closely related to the problem of compressed sensing, where the task is to estimate a sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements. Contrary to results in compressed sensing, where it has been shown that neither adaptivity nor contiguous structure help much, we show that for reliable localization the magnitude of the weakest signals is strongly influenced by both structure and the ability to choose measurements adaptively while for detection neither adaptivity nor structure reduce the requirement on the magnitude of the signal. We characterize the precise tradeoffs between the various problem parameters, the signal strength and the number of measurements required to reliably detect and localize the block of activation. The sufficient conditions are complemented with information theoretic lower bounds.	Recovering Block-structured Activations Using Compressive Measurements
1007.2450v1	Distributions over permutations arise in applications ranging from multi-object tracking to ranking of instances. The difficulty of dealing with these distributions is caused by the size of their domain, which is factorial in the number of considered entities ($n!$). It makes the direct definition of a multinomial distribution over permutation space impractical for all but a very small $n$. In this work we propose an embedding of all $n!$ permutations for a given $n$ in a surface of a hypersphere defined in $\mathbbm{R}^{(n-1)^2}$. As a result of the embedding, we acquire ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of directional statistics. We provide polynomial time projections between the continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space. The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations. As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations. We demonstrate the approach with applications.	Directional Statistics on Permutations
1510.02354v1	We consider sequential decision making problems for binary classification scenario in which the learner takes an active role in repeatedly selecting samples from the action pool and receives the binary label of the selected alternatives. Our problem is motivated by applications where observations are time consuming and/or expensive, resulting in small samples. The goal is to identify the best alternative with the highest response. We use Bayesian logistic regression to predict the response of each alternative. By formulating the problem as a Markov decision process, we develop a knowledge-gradient type policy to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information of labeling each alternative and provide a finite-time analysis on the estimated error. Experiments on benchmark UCI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	The Knowledge Gradient with Logistic Belief Models for Binary  Classification
1706.02492v1	We consider stationary autoregressive processes with coefficients restricted to an ellipsoid, which includes autoregressive processes with absolutely summable coefficients. We provide consistency results under different norms for the estimation of such processes using constrained and penalized estimators. As an application we show some weak form of universal consistency. Simulations show that directly including the constraint in the estimation can lead to more robust results.	Consistency Results for Stationary Autoregressive Processes with  Constrained Coefficients
1203.3497v1	Most conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms aim to optimize decision-making rules in terms of the expected returns. However, especially for risk management purposes, other risk-sensitive criteria such as the value-at-risk or the expected shortfall are sometimes preferred in real applications. Here, we describe a parametric method for estimating density of the returns, which allows us to handle various criteria in a unified manner. We first extend the Bellman equation for the conditional expected return to cover a conditional probability density of the returns. Then we derive an extension of the TD-learning algorithm for estimating the return densities in an unknown environment. As test instances, several parametric density estimation algorithms are presented for the Gaussian, Laplace, and skewed Laplace distributions. We show that these algorithms lead to risk-sensitive as well as robust RL paradigms through numerical experiments.	Parametric Return Density Estimation for Reinforcement Learning
1705.09199v3	Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a widely popular framework for generative modelling of high-dimensional datasets. However their training is well-known to be difficult. This work presents a rigorous statistical analysis of GANs providing straight-forward explanations for common training pathologies such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, it proposes a new training objective, Kernel GANs, and demonstrates its practical effectiveness on large-scale real-world data sets. A key element in the analysis is the distinction between training with respect to the (unknown) data distribution, and its empirical counterpart. To overcome issues in GAN training, we pursue the idea of smoothing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) by incorporating noise in the input distributions of the discriminator. As we show, this effectively leads to an empirical version of the JSD in which the true and the generator densities are replaced by kernel density estimates, which leads to Kernel GANs.

1008.4000v1	"Support vector machines (SVMs) are invaluable tools for many practical applications in artificial intelligence, e.g., classification and event recognition. However, popular SVM solvers are not sufficiently efficient for applications with a great deal of samples as well as a large number of features. In this paper, thus, we present NESVM, a fast gradient SVM solver that can optimize various SVM models, e.g., classical SVM, linear programming SVM and least square SVM. Compared against SVM-Perf \cite{SVM_Perf}\cite{PerfML} (its convergence rate in solving the dual SVM is upper bounded by $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$, wherein $k$ is the number of iterations.) and Pegasos \cite{Pegasos} (online SVM that converges at rate $\mathcal O(1/k)$ for the primal SVM), NESVM achieves the optimal convergence rate at $\mathcal O(1/k^{2})$ and a linear time complexity. In particular, NESVM smoothes the non-differentiable hinge loss and $\ell_1$-norm in the primal SVM. Then the optimal gradient method without any line search is adopted to solve the optimization. In each iteration round, the current gradient and historical gradients are combined to determine the descent direction, while the Lipschitz constant determines the step size. Only two matrix-vector multiplications are required in each iteration round. Therefore, NESVM is more efficient than existing SVM solvers. In addition, NESVM is available for both linear and nonlinear kernels. We also propose ""homotopy NESVM"" to accelerate NESVM by dynamically decreasing the smooth parameter and using the continuation method. Our experiments on census income categorization, indoor/outdoor scene classification, event recognition and scene recognition suggest the efficiency and the effectiveness of NESVM. The MATLAB code of NESVM will be available on our website for further assessment."	NESVM: a Fast Gradient Method for Support Vector Machines
0912.5507v1	Supervised topic models utilize document's side information for discovering predictive low dimensional representations of documents. Existing models apply the likelihood-based estimation. In this paper, we present a general framework of max-margin supervised topic models for both continuous and categorical response variables. Our approach, the maximum entropy discrimination latent Dirichlet allocation (MedLDA), utilizes the max-margin principle to train supervised topic models and estimate predictive topic representations that are arguably more suitable for prediction tasks. The general principle of MedLDA can be applied to perform joint max-margin learning and maximum likelihood estimation for arbitrary topic models, directed or undirected, and supervised or unsupervised, when the supervised side information is available. We develop efficient variational methods for posterior inference and parameter estimation, and demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively the advantages of MedLDA over likelihood-based topic models on movie review and 20 Newsgroups data sets.	MedLDA: A General Framework of Maximum Margin Supervised Topic Models
1802.07481v2	Convex sparsity-inducing regularizations are ubiquitous in high-dimension machine learning, but their non-differentiability requires the use of iterative solvers. To accelerate such solvers, state-of-the-art approaches consist in reducing the size of the optimization problem at hand. In the context of regression, this can be achieved either by discarding irrelevant features (screening techniques) or by prioritizing features likely to be included in the support of the solution (working set techniques). Duality comes into play at several steps in these techniques. Here, we propose an extrapolation technique starting from a sequence of iterates in the dual that leads to the construction of an improved dual point. This enables a tighter control of optimality as used in stopping criterion, as well as better screening performance of Gap Safe rules. Finally, we propose a working set strategy based on an aggressive use of Gap Safe rules and our new dual point construction, which improves state-of-the-art time performance on Lasso problems.	Dual Extrapolation for Faster Lasso Solvers
1503.08727v1	Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) are likelihood-free Monte Carlo methods. ABC methods use a comparison between simulated data, using different parameters drew from a prior distribution, and observed data. This comparison process is based on computing a distance between the summary statistics from the simulated data and the observed data. For complex models, it is usually difficult to define a methodology for choosing or constructing the summary statistics. Recently, a nonparametric ABC has been proposed, that uses a dissimilarity measure between discrete distributions based on empirical kernel embeddings as an alternative for summary statistics. The nonparametric ABC outperforms other methods including ABC, kernel ABC or synthetic likelihood ABC. However, it assumes that the probability distributions are discrete, and it is not robust when dealing with few observations. In this paper, we propose to apply kernel embeddings using an smoother density estimator or Parzen estimator for comparing the empirical data distributions, and computing the ABC posterior. Synthetic data and real data were used to test the Bayesian inference of our method. We compare our method with respect to state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrate that our method is a robust estimator of the posterior distribution in terms of the number of observations.	A Parzen-based distance between probability measures as an alternative  of summary statistics in Approximate Bayesian Computation
1105.2493v6	We define and discuss the first sparse coding algorithm based on closed-form EM updates and continuous latent variables. The underlying generative model consists of a standard `spike-and-slab' prior and a Gaussian noise model. Closed-form solutions for E- and M-step equations are derived by generalizing probabilistic PCA. The resulting EM algorithm can take all modes of a potentially multi-modal posterior into account. The computational cost of the algorithm scales exponentially with the number of hidden dimensions. However, with current computational resources, it is still possible to efficiently learn model parameters for medium-scale problems. Thus the model can be applied to the typical range of source separation tasks. In numerical experiments on artificial data we verify likelihood maximization and show that the derived algorithm recovers the sparse directions of standard sparse coding distributions. On source separation benchmarks comprised of realistic data we show that the algorithm is competitive with other recent methods.	Closed-form EM for Sparse Coding and its Application to Source  Separation
1011.6095v2	For high-dimensional classification, it is well known that naively performing the Fisher discriminant rule leads to poor results due to diverging spectra and noise accumulation. Therefore, researchers proposed independence rules to circumvent the diverse spectra, and sparse independence rules to mitigate the issue of noise accumulation. However, in biological applications, there are often a group of correlated genes responsible for clinical outcomes, and the use of the covariance information can significantly reduce misclassification rates. The extent of such error rate reductions is unveiled by comparing the misclassification rates of the Fisher discriminant rule and the independence rule. To materialize the gain based on finite samples, a Regularized Optimal Affine Discriminant (ROAD) is proposed based on a covariance penalty. ROAD selects an increasing number of features as the penalization relaxes. Further benefits can be achieved when a screening method is employed to narrow the feature pool before hitting the ROAD. An efficient Constrained Coordinate Descent algorithm (CCD) is also developed to solve the associated optimization problems. Sampling properties of oracle type are established. Simulation studies and real data analysis support our theoretical results and demonstrate the advantages of the new classification procedure under a variety of correlation structures. A delicate result on continuous piecewise linear solution path for the ROAD optimization problem at the population level justifies the linear interpolation of the CCD algorithm.	A ROAD to Classification in High Dimensional Space
1802.08163v1	Distributional approaches to value-based reinforcement learning model the entire distribution of returns, rather than just their expected values, and have recently been shown to yield state-of-the-art empirical performance. This was demonstrated by the recently proposed C51 algorithm, based on categorical distributional reinforcement learning (CDRL) [Bellemare et al., 2017]. However, the theoretical properties of CDRL algorithms are not yet well understood. In this paper, we introduce a framework to analyse CDRL algorithms, establish the importance of the projected distributional Bellman operator in distributional RL, draw fundamental connections between CDRL and the Cram\'er distance, and give a proof of convergence for sample-based categorical distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.	An Analysis of Categorical Distributional Reinforcement Learning
1409.4005v1	This paper studies ordered weighted L1 (OWL) norm regularization for sparse estimation problems with strongly correlated variables. We prove sufficient conditions for clustering based on the correlation/colinearity of variables using the OWL norm, of which the so-called OSCAR is a particular case. Our results extend previous ones for OSCAR in several ways: for the squared error loss, our conditions hold for the more general OWL norm and under weaker assumptions; we also establish clustering conditions for the absolute error loss, which is, as far as we know, a novel result. Furthermore, we characterize the statistical performance of OWL norm regularization for generative models in which certain clusters of regression variables are strongly (even perfectly) correlated, but variables in different clusters are uncorrelated. We show that if the true p-dimensional signal generating the data involves only s of the clusters, then O(s log p) samples suffice to accurately estimate the signal, regardless of the number of coefficients within the clusters. The estimation of s-sparse signals with completely independent variables requires just as many measurements. In other words, using the OWL we pay no price (in terms of the number of measurements) for the presence of strongly correlated variables.	Sparse Estimation with Strongly Correlated Variables using Ordered  Weighted L1 Regularization
0803.0966v1	Mining association rules is an important technique for discovering meaningful patterns in transaction databases. Many different measures of interestingness have been proposed for association rules. However, these measures fail to take the probabilistic properties of the mined data into account. In this paper, we start with presenting a simple probabilistic framework for transaction data which can be used to simulate transaction data when no associations are present. We use such data and a real-world database from a grocery outlet to explore the behavior of confidence and lift, two popular interest measures used for rule mining. The results show that confidence is systematically influenced by the frequency of the items in the left hand side of rules and that lift performs poorly to filter random noise in transaction data. Based on the probabilistic framework we develop two new interest measures, hyper-lift and hyper-confidence, which can be used to filter or order mined association rules. The new measures show significantly better performance than lift for applications where spurious rules are problematic.	New probabilistic interest measures for association rules
1406.3711v1	Despite the fact that they do not consider the temporal nature of data, classic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, are widely applied to time series data. In this paper, we introduce a factor decomposition specific for time series that builds upon the Bayesian multivariate autoregressive model and hence evades the assumption that data points are mutually independent. The key is to find a low-rank estimation of the autoregressive matrices. As in the probabilistic version of other factor models, this induces a latent low-dimensional representation of the original data. We discuss some possible generalisations and alternatives, with the most relevant being a technique for simultaneous smoothing and dimensionality reduction. To illustrate the potential applications, we apply the model on a synthetic data set and different types of neuroimaging data (EEG and ECoG).	Dimensionality reduction for time series data
1604.07463v1	We consider a firm that sells products over $T$ periods without knowing the demand function. The firm sequentially sets prices to earn revenue and to learn the underlying demand function simultaneously. A natural heuristic for this problem, commonly used in practice, is greedy iterative least squares (GILS). At each time period, GILS estimates the demand as a linear function of the price by applying least squares to the set of prior prices and realized demands. Then a price that maximizes the revenue, given the estimated demand function, is used for the next time period. The performance is measured by the regret, which is the expected revenue loss from the optimal (oracle) pricing policy when the demand function is known. Recently, den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014) demonstrated that GILS is sub-optimal. They introduced algorithms which integrate forced price dispersion with GILS and achieve asymptotically optimal performance. In this paper, we consider this dynamic pricing problem in a data-rich environment. In particular, we assume that the firm knows the expected demand under a particular price from historical data, and in each period, before setting the price, the firm has access to extra information (demand covariates) which may be predictive of the demand. We prove that in this setting GILS achieves asymptotically optimal regret of order $\log(T)$. We also show the following surprising result: in the original dynamic pricing problem of den Boer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014), inclusion of any set of covariates in GILS as potential demand covariates (even though they could carry no information) would make GILS asymptotically optimal. We validate our results via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and real data sets.	Dynamic Pricing with Demand Covariates
1705.07761v3	Deep generative models provide powerful tools for distributions over complicated manifolds, such as those of natural images. But many of these methods, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), can be difficult to train, in part because they are prone to mode collapse, which means that they characterize only a few modes of the true distribution. To address this, we introduce VEEGAN, which features a reconstructor network, reversing the action of the generator by mapping from data to noise. Our training objective retains the original asymptotic consistency guarantee of GANs, and can be interpreted as a novel autoencoder loss over the noise. In sharp contrast to a traditional autoencoder over data points, VEEGAN does not require specifying a loss function over the data, but rather only over the representations, which are standard normal by assumption. On an extensive set of synthetic and real world image datasets, VEEGAN indeed resists mode collapsing to a far greater extent than other recent GAN variants, and produces more realistic samples.

1108.5244v3	This article addresses the problem of classification method based on both labeled and unlabeled data, where we assume that a density function for labeled data is different from that for unlabeled data. We propose a semi-supervised logistic regression model for classification problem along with the technique of covariate shift adaptation. Unknown parameters involved in proposed models are estimated by regularization with EM algorithm. A crucial issue in the modeling process is the choices of tuning parameters in our semi-supervised logistic models. In order to select the parameters, a model selection criterion is derived from an information-theoretic approach. Some numerical studies show that our modeling procedure performs well in various cases.

0907.5494v1	We investigate the role of the initialization for the stability of the k-means clustering algorithm. As opposed to other papers, we consider the actual k-means algorithm and do not ignore its property of getting stuck in local optima. We are interested in the actual clustering, not only in the costs of the solution. We analyze when different initializations lead to the same local optimum, and when they lead to different local optima. This enables us to prove that it is reasonable to select the number of clusters based on stability scores.	How the initialization affects the stability of the k-means algorithm
1409.4573v3	We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for a type of asymmetry between causes and effects that is present when these are related via linear models contaminated with additive non-Gaussian noise. Assuming that the causes and the effects have the same distribution, we show that the distribution of the residuals of a linear fit in the anti-causal direction is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of the residuals in the causal direction. This Gaussianization effect is characterized by reduction of the magnitude of the high-order cumulants and by an increment of the differential entropy of the residuals. The problem of non-linear causal inference is addressed by performing an embedding in an expanded feature space, in which the relation between causes and effects can be assumed to be linear. The effectiveness of a method to discriminate between causes and effects based on this type of asymmetry is illustrated in a variety of experiments using different measures of Gaussianity. The proposed method is shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art techniques for causal inference.	Non-linear Causal Inference using Gaussianity Measures
1512.08298v3	We propose a novel class of time-varying nonparanormal graphical models, which allows us to model high dimensional heavy-tailed systems and the evolution of their latent network structures. Under this model, we develop statistical tests for presence of edges both locally at a fixed index value and globally over a range of values. The tests are developed for a high-dimensional regime, are robust to model selection mistakes and do not require commonly assumed minimum signal strength. The testing procedures are based on a high dimensional, debiasing-free moment estimator, which uses a novel kernel smoothed Kendall's tau correlation matrix as an input statistic. The estimator consistently estimates the latent inverse Pearson correlation matrix uniformly in both the index variable and kernel bandwidth. Its rate of convergence is shown to be minimax optimal. Our method is supported by thorough numerical simulations and an application to a neural imaging data set.	Post-Regularization Inference for Time-Varying Nonparanormal Graphical  Models
1707.03010v1	Given the observation of a high-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process in continuous time, we proceed to the inference of the drift parameter under a row-sparsity assumption. Towards that aim, we consider the negative log-likelihood of the process, penalized by an $\ell^1$-penalization (Lasso and Adaptive Lasso). We provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic results for this procedure, by means of a sharp oracle inequality, and a limit theorem in the long-time asymptotics, including asymptotic consistency for variable selection. As a by-product, we point out the fact that for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, one does not need an assumption of restricted eigenvalue type in order to derive fast rates for the Lasso, while it is well-known to be mandatory for linear regression for instance. Numerical results illustrate the benefits of this penalized procedure compared to standard maximum likelihood approaches both on simulations and real-world financial data.	Sparse inference of the drift of a high-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck  process
1710.05163v1	The modified Cholesky decomposition is commonly used for inverse covariance matrix estimation given a specified order of random variables. However, the order of variables is often not available or cannot be pre-determined. Hence, we propose a novel estimator to address the variable order issue in the modified Cholesky decomposition to estimate the sparse inverse covariance matrix. The key idea is to effectively combine a set of estimates obtained from multiple permutations of variable orders, and to efficiently encourage the sparse structure for the resultant estimate by the use of thresholding technique on the combined Cholesky factor matrix. The consistent property of the proposed estimate is established under some weak regularity conditions. Simulation studies show the superior performance of the proposed method in comparison with several existing approaches. We also apply the proposed method into the linear discriminant analysis for analyzing real-data examples for classification.	An Improved Modified Cholesky Decomposition Method for Inverse  Covariance Matrix Estimation
1009.2718v1	"We present surrogate regret bounds for arbitrary surrogate losses in the context of binary classification with label-dependent costs. Such bounds relate a classifier's risk, assessed with respect to a surrogate loss, to its cost-sensitive classification risk. Two approaches to surrogate regret bounds are developed. The first is a direct generalization of Bartlett et al. [2006], who focus on margin-based losses and cost-insensitive classification, while the second adopts the framework of Steinwart [2007] based on calibration functions. Nontrivial surrogate regret bounds are shown to exist precisely when the surrogate loss satisfies a ""calibration"" condition that is easily verified for many common losses. We apply this theory to the class of uneven margin losses, and characterize when these losses are properly calibrated. The uneven hinge, squared error, exponential, and sigmoid losses are then treated in detail."	Calibrated Surrogate Losses for Classification with Label-Dependent  Costs
1205.2604v1	We present the Infinite Latent Events Model, a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian distribution over infinite dimensional Dynamic Bayesian Networks with binary state representations and noisy-OR-like transitions. The distribution can be used to learn structure in discrete timeseries data by simultaneously inferring a set of latent events, which events fired at each timestep, and how those events are causally linked. We illustrate the model on a sound factorization task, a network topology identification task, and a video game task.	The Infinite Latent Events Model
1205.4377v2	In many classification systems, sensing modalities have different acquisition costs. It is often {\it unnecessary} to use every modality to classify a majority of examples. We study a multi-stage system in a prediction time cost reduction setting, where the full data is available for training, but for a test example, measurements in a new modality can be acquired at each stage for an additional cost. We seek decision rules to reduce the average measurement acquisition cost. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem (ERM) for a multi-stage reject classifier, wherein the stage $k$ classifier either classifies a sample using only the measurements acquired so far or rejects it to the next stage where more attributes can be acquired for a cost. To solve the ERM problem, we show that the optimal reject classifier at each stage is a combination of two binary classifiers, one biased towards positive examples and the other biased towards negative examples. We use this parameterization to construct stage-by-stage global surrogate risk, develop an iterative algorithm in the boosting framework and present convergence and generalization results. We test our work on synthetic, medical and explosives detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that substantial cost reduction without a significant sacrifice in accuracy is achievable.	Multi-Stage Classifier Design
1801.03222v1	This paper deals with inference and prediction for multiple correlated time series, where one has also the choice of using a candidate pool of contemporaneous predictors for each target series. Starting with a structural model for the time-series, Bayesian tools are used for model fitting, prediction, and feature selection, thus extending some recent work along these lines for the univariate case. The Bayesian paradigm in this multivariate setting helps the model avoid overfitting as well as capture correlations among the multiple time series with the various state components. The model provides needed flexibility to choose a different set of components and available predictors for each target series. The cyclical component in the model can handle large variations in the short term, which may be caused by external shocks. We run extensive simulations to investigate properties such as estimation accuracy and performance in forecasting. We then run an empirical study with one-step-ahead prediction on the max log return of a portfolio of stocks that involve four leading financial institutions. Both the simulation studies and the extensive empirical study confirm that this multivariate model outperforms three other benchmark models, viz. a model that treats each target series as independent, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with regression (ARIMAX), and the multivariate ARIMAX (MARIMAX) model.	Multivariate Bayesian Structural Time Series Model
1203.6130v1	Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be accurately approximated using co-occurrence frequencies of pairs and triples of observations by using a fast spectral method in contrast to the usual slow methods like EM or Gibbs sampling. We provide a new spectral method which significantly reduces the number of model parameters that need to be estimated, and generates a sample complexity that does not depend on the size of the observation vocabulary. We present an elementary proof giving bounds on the relative accuracy of probability estimates from our model. (Correlaries show our bounds can be weakened to provide either L1 bounds or KL bounds which provide easier direct comparisons to previous work.) Our theorem uses conditions that are checkable from the data, instead of putting conditions on the unobservable Markov transition matrix.	Spectral dimensionality reduction for HMMs
1507.06977v4	In this paper we introduce a novel framework for making exact nonparametric Bayesian inference on latent functions, that is particularly suitable for Big Data tasks. Firstly, we introduce a class of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs), which are not to be mistaken for Gaussian processes operating on text. We construct string GPs so that their finite-dimensional marginals exhibit suitable local conditional independence structures, which allow for scalable, distributed, and flexible nonparametric Bayesian inference, without resorting to approximations, and while ensuring some mild global regularity constraints. Furthermore, string GP priors naturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learned latent function is readily available for explanatory analysis. Secondly, we provide some theoretical results relating our approach to the standard GP paradigm. In particular, we prove that some string GPs are Gaussian processes, which provides a complementary global perspective on our framework. Finally, we derive a scalable and distributed MCMC scheme for supervised learning tasks under string GP priors. The proposed MCMC scheme has computational time complexity $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and memory requirement $\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $N$ is the data size and $d$ the dimension of the input space. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on several synthetic and real-world datasets, including a dataset with $6$ millions input points and $8$ attributes.	String and Membrane Gaussian Processes
1112.2289v1	Exact inference in the linear regression model with spike and slab priors is often intractable. Expectation propagation (EP) can be used for approximate inference. However, the regular sequential form of EP (R-EP) may fail to converge in this model when the size of the training set is very small. As an alternative, we propose a provably convergent EP algorithm (PC-EP). PC-EP is proved to minimize an energy function which, under some constraints, is bounded from below and whose stationary points coincide with the solution of R-EP. Experiments with synthetic data indicate that when R-EP does not converge, the approximation generated by PC-EP is often better. By contrast, when R-EP converges, both methods perform similarly.	Convergent Expectation Propagation in Linear Models with Spike-and-slab  Priors
1710.10720v3	In this study we introduce a new technique for symbolic regression that guarantees global optimality. This is achieved by formulating a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) whose solution is a symbolic mathematical expression of minimum complexity that explains the observations. We demonstrate our approach by rediscovering Kepler's law on planetary motion using exoplanet data and Galileo's pendulum periodicity equation using experimental data.	Globally Optimal Symbolic Regression
1303.2488v1	Concept Hierarchies and Formal Concept Analysis are theoretically well grounded and largely experimented methods. They rely on line diagrams called Galois lattices for visualizing and analysing object-attribute sets. Galois lattices are visually seducing and conceptually rich for experts. However they present important drawbacks due to their concept oriented overall structure: analysing what they show is difficult for non experts, navigation is cumbersome, interaction is poor, and scalability is a deep bottleneck for visual interpretation even for experts. In this paper we introduce semantic probes as a means to overcome many of these problems and extend usability and application possibilities of traditional FCA visualization methods. Semantic probes are visual user centred objects which extract and organize reduced Galois sub-hierarchies. They are simpler, clearer, and they provide a better navigation support through a rich set of interaction possibilities. Since probe driven sub-hierarchies are limited to users focus, scalability is under control and interpretation is facilitated. After some successful experiments, several applications are being developed with the remaining problem of finding a compromise between simplicity and conceptual expressivity.	Visualizing and Interacting with Concept Hierarchies
1312.5386v1	Probabilistic models often have parameters that can be translated, scaled, permuted, or otherwise transformed without changing the model. These symmetries can lead to strong correlation and multimodality in the posterior distribution over the model's parameters, which can pose challenges both for performing inference and interpreting the results. In this work, we address the automatic detection of common problematic model symmetries. To do so, we introduce local symmetries, which cover many common cases and are amenable to automatic detection. We show how to derive algorithms to detect several broad classes of local symmetries. Our algorithms are compatible with probabilistic programming constructs such as arrays, for loops, and if statements, and they scale to models with many variables.	Detecting Parameter Symmetries in Probabilistic Models
1102.2041v3	Partial-monitoring games constitute a mathematical framework for sequential decision making problems with imperfect feedback: The learner repeatedly chooses an action, opponent responds with an outcome, and then the learner suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal, both of which are fixed functions of the action and the outcome. The goal of the learner is to minimize his total cumulative loss. We make progress towards the classification of these games based on their minimax expected regret. Namely, we classify almost all games with two outcomes and finite number of actions: We show that their minimax expected regret is either zero, $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$, $\Theta(T^{2/3})$, or $\Theta(T)$ and we give a simple and efficiently computable classification of these four classes of games. Our hope is that the result can serve as a stepping stone toward classifying all finite partial-monitoring games.	Toward a Classification of Finite Partial-Monitoring Games
1104.3621v4	The complex wave representation (CWR) converts unsigned 2D distance transforms into their corresponding wave functions. Here, the distance transform S(X) appears as the phase of the wave function \phi(X)---specifically, \phi(X)=exp(iS(X)/\tau where \tau is a free parameter. In this work, we prove a novel result using the higher-order stationary phase approximation: we show convergence of the normalized power spectrum (squared magnitude of the Fourier transform) of the wave function to the density function of the distance transform gradients as the free parameter \tau-->0. In colloquial terms, spatial frequencies are gradient histogram bins. Since the distance transform gradients have only orientation information (as their magnitudes are identically equal to one almost everywhere), as \tau-->0, the 2D Fourier transform values mainly lie on the unit circle in the spatial frequency domain. The proof of the result involves standard integration techniques and requires proper ordering of limits. Our mathematical relation indicates that the CWR of distance transforms is an intriguing, new representation.	Distance Transform Gradient Density Estimation using the Stationary  Phase Approximation
1201.5568v1	Data collection at a massive scale is becoming ubiquitous in a wide variety of settings, from vast offline databases to streaming real-time information. Learning algorithms deployed in such contexts must rely on single-pass inference, where the data history is never revisited. In streaming contexts, learning must also be temporally adaptive to remain up-to-date against unforeseen changes in the data generating mechanism. Although rapidly growing, the online Bayesian inference literature remains challenged by massive data and transient, evolving data streams. Non-parametric modelling techniques can prove particularly ill-suited, as the complexity of the model is allowed to increase with the sample size. In this work, we take steps to overcome these challenges by porting standard streaming techniques, like data discarding and downweighting, into a fully Bayesian framework via the use of informative priors and active learning heuristics. We showcase our methods by augmenting a modern non-parametric modelling framework, dynamic trees, and illustrate its performance on a number of practical examples. The end product is a powerful streaming regression and classification tool, whose performance compares favourably to the state-of-the-art.	Dynamic trees for streaming and massive data contexts
1704.02502v1	This paper describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which, with interactive graphics, can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this paper, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using the ggplot2, plotly, and shiny packages.	Interactive Graphics for Visually Diagnosing Forest Classifiers in R
1202.0302v2	Most machine learning algorithms, such as classification or regression, treat the individual data point as the object of interest. Here we consider extending machine learning algorithms to operate on groups of data points. We suggest treating a group of data points as an i.i.d. sample set from an underlying feature distribution for that group. Our approach employs kernel machines with a kernel on i.i.d. sample sets of vectors. We define certain kernel functions on pairs of distributions, and then use a nonparametric estimator to consistently estimate those functions based on sample sets. The projection of the estimated Gram matrix to the cone of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices enables us to use kernel machines for classification, regression, anomaly detection, and low-dimensional embedding in the space of distributions. We present several numerical experiments both on real and simulated datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our new approach.	Kernels on Sample Sets via Nonparametric Divergence Estimates
1311.6182v1	Robust tensor recovery plays an instrumental role in robustifying tensor decompositions for multilinear data analysis against outliers, gross corruptions and missing values and has a diverse array of applications. In this paper, we study the problem of robust low-rank tensor recovery in a convex optimization framework, drawing upon recent advances in robust Principal Component Analysis and tensor completion. We propose tailored optimization algorithms with global convergence guarantees for solving both the constrained and the Lagrangian formulations of the problem. These algorithms are based on the highly efficient alternating direction augmented Lagrangian and accelerated proximal gradient methods. We also propose a nonconvex model that can often improve the recovery results from the convex models. We investigate the empirical recoverability properties of the convex and nonconvex formulations and compare the computational performance of the algorithms on simulated data. We demonstrate through a number of real applications the practical effectiveness of this convex optimization framework for robust low-rank tensor recovery.

1612.03080v1	We focus on the maximum regularization parameter for anisotropic total-variation denoising. It corresponds to the minimum value of the regularization parameter above which the solution remains constant. While this value is well know for the Lasso, such a critical value has not been investigated in details for the total-variation. Though, it is of importance when tuning the regularization parameter as it allows fixing an upper-bound on the grid for which the optimal parameter is sought. We establish a closed form expression for the one-dimensional case, as well as an upper-bound for the two-dimensional case, that appears reasonably tight in practice. This problem is directly linked to the computation of the pseudo-inverse of the divergence, which can be quickly obtained by performing convolutions in the Fourier domain.	Characterizing the maximum parameter of the total-variation denoising  through the pseudo-inverse of the divergence
1702.07066v1	Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods have been heavily exploited to analyse the association between two blocs of data. These powerful approaches can be applied to data sets where the number of variables is greater than the number of observations and in presence of high collinearity between variables. Different sparse versions of PLS have been developed to integrate multiple data sets while simultaneously selecting the contributing variables. Sparse modelling is a key factor in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between multiple data sets. The cornerstone of the sparsity version of PLS methods is the link between the SVD of a matrix (constructed from deflated versions of the original matrices of data) and least squares minimisation in linear regression. We present here an accurate description of the most popular PLS methods, alongside their mathematical proofs. A unified algorithm is proposed to perform all four types of PLS including their regularised versions. Various approaches to decrease the computation time are offered, and we show how the whole procedure can be scalable to big data sets.

0710.3183v1	We provide self-contained proof of a theorem relating probabilistic coherence of forecasts to their non-domination by rival forecasts with respect to any proper scoring rule.

0907.1013v1	"We describe a new method for visualizing topics, the distributions over terms that are automatically extracted from large text corpora using latent variable models. Our method finds significant $n$-grams related to a topic, which are then used to help understand and interpret the underlying distribution. Compared with the usual visualization, which simply lists the most probable topical terms, the multi-word expressions provide a better intuitive impression for what a topic is ""about."" Our approach is based on a language model of arbitrary length expressions, for which we develop a new methodology based on nested permutation tests to find significant phrases. We show that this method outperforms the more standard use of $\chi^2$ and likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the topic presentations on corpora of scientific abstracts and news articles."

1305.0047v2	We consider the following signal recovery problem: given a measurement matrix $\Phi\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ and a noisy observation vector $c\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ constructed from $c = \Phi\theta^* + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d. centered sub-Gaussian distribution, how to recover the signal $\theta^*$ if $D\theta^*$ is sparse {\rca under a linear transformation} $D\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times p}$? One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem: $$\min_{\theta} {1\over 2}\|\Phi\theta - c\|^2 + \lambda\|D\theta\|_1.$$ This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix $\Phi$ is a Gaussian random matrix. Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement number $n\geq \Omega(s\log(p))$ where $s$ is the sparsity number, then the true solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement increases faster than $s\log(p)$, that is, $s\log(p)=o(n)$, the estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when $p$ and $s$ go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the special case $D=\bold{I}_{p\times p}$ (equivalently LASSO) and improve the existing analysis. The condition number of $D$ plays a critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant, while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with high probability if $m\over p$ (i.e., $#text{edge}\over #text{vertex}$) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical simulations are consistent with our theoretical results.	Dictionary LASSO: Guaranteed Sparse Recovery under Linear Transformation
1702.05037v2	We consider additive models built with trend filtering, i.e., additive models whose components are each regularized by the (discrete) total variation of their $(k+1)$st (discrete) derivative, for a chosen integer $k \geq 0$. This results in $k$th degree piecewise polynomial components, (e.g., $k=0$ gives piecewise constant components, $k=1$ gives piecewise linear, $k=2$ gives piecewise quadratic, etc.). In univariate nonparametric regression, the localized nature of the total variation regularizer used by trend filtering has been shown to produce estimates with superior local adaptivity to those from smoothing splines (and linear smoothers, more generally) (Tibshirani [2014]). Further, the structured nature of this regularizer has been shown to lead to highly efficient computational routines for trend filtering (Kim et al. [2009], Ramdas and Tibshirani [2016]). In this paper, we argue that both of these properties carry over to the additive models setting. We derive fast error rates for additive trend filtering estimates, and prove that these rates are minimax optimal when the underlying function is itself additive and has component functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation. We show that such rates are unattainable by additive smoothing splines (and by additive models built from linear smoothers, in general). We argue that backfitting provides an efficient algorithm for additive trend filtering, as it is built around the fast univariate trend filtering solvers; moreover, we describe a modified backfitting procedure whose iterations can be run in parallel. Finally, we conduct experiments to examine the empirical properties of additive trend filtering, and outline some possible extensions.	Additive Models with Trend Filtering
1506.02236v2	In this paper we propose a family of tractable kernels that is dense in the family of bounded positive semi-definite functions (i.e. can approximate any bounded kernel with arbitrary precision). We start by discussing the case of stationary kernels, and propose a family of spectral kernels that extends existing approaches such as spectral mixture kernels and sparse spectrum kernels. Our extension has two primary advantages. Firstly, unlike existing spectral approaches that yield infinite differentiability, the kernels we introduce allow learning the degree of differentiability of the latent function in Gaussian process (GP) models and functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in other kernel methods. Secondly, we show that some of the kernels we propose require fewer parameters than existing spectral kernels for the same accuracy, thereby leading to faster and more robust inference. Finally, we generalize our approach and propose a flexible and tractable family of spectral kernels that we prove can approximate any continuous bounded nonstationary kernel.	Generalized Spectral Kernels
1507.00052v2	We study the Gaussian Process regression model in the context of training data with noise in both input and output. The presence of two sources of noise makes the task of learning accurate predictive models extremely challenging. However, in some instances additional constraints may be available that can reduce the uncertainty in the resulting predictive models. In particular, we consider the case of monotonically ordered latent input, which occurs in many application domains that deal with temporal data. We present a novel inference and learning approach based on non-parametric Gaussian variational approximation to learn the GP model while taking into account the new constraints. The resulting strategy allows one to gain access to posterior estimates of both the input and the output and results in improved predictive performance. We compare our proposed models to state-of-the-art Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) and other competing approaches on synthetic and real sea-level rise data. Experimental results suggest that the proposed approach consistently outperforms selected methods while, at the same time, reducing the computational costs of learning and inference.	Gaussian Process for Noisy Inputs with Ordering Constraints
1112.5404v1	We consider the problem of classification using similarity/distance functions over data. Specifically, we propose a framework for defining the goodness of a (dis)similarity function with respect to a given learning task and propose algorithms that have guaranteed generalization properties when working with such good functions. Our framework unifies and generalizes the frameworks proposed by [Balcan-Blum ICML 2006] and [Wang et al ICML 2007]. An attractive feature of our framework is its adaptability to data - we do not promote a fixed notion of goodness but rather let data dictate it. We show, by giving theoretical guarantees that the goodness criterion best suited to a problem can itself be learned which makes our approach applicable to a variety of domains and problems. We propose a landmarking-based approach to obtaining a classifier from such learned goodness criteria. We then provide a novel diversity based heuristic to perform task-driven selection of landmark points instead of random selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our goodness criteria learning method as well as the landmark selection heuristic on a variety of similarity-based learning datasets and benchmark UCI datasets on which our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.	Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings
1205.2599v1	By taking into account the nonlinear effect of the cause, the inner noise effect, and the measurement distortion effect in the observed variables, the post-nonlinear (PNL) causal model has demonstrated its excellent performance in distinguishing the cause from effect. However, its identifiability has not been properly addressed, and how to apply it in the case of more than two variables is also a problem. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on its identifiability in the two-variable case. We show that this model is identifiable in most cases; by enumerating all possible situations in which the model is not identifiable, we provide sufficient conditions for its identifiability. Simulations are given to support the theoretical results. Moreover, in the case of more than two variables, we show that the whole causal structure can be found by applying the PNL causal model to each structure in the Markov equivalent class and testing if the disturbance is independent of the direct causes for each variable. In this way the exhaustive search over all possible causal structures is avoided.	On the Identifiability of the Post-Nonlinear Causal Model
1506.02371v4	It is becoming increasingly important for machine learning methods to make predictions that are interpretable as well as accurate. In many practical applications, it is of interest which features and feature interactions are relevant to the prediction task. We present a novel method, Selective Bayesian Forest Classifier, that strikes a balance between predictive power and interpretability by simultaneously performing classification, feature selection, feature interaction detection and visualization. It builds parsimonious yet flexible models using tree-structured Bayesian networks, and samples an ensemble of such models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We build in feature selection by dividing the trees into two groups according to their relevance to the outcome of interest. Our method performs competitively on classification and feature selection benchmarks in low and high dimensions, and includes a visualization tool that provides insight into relevant features and interactions.	Interpretable Selection and Visualization of Features and Interactions  Using Bayesian Forests
1704.00060v1	An exciting branch of machine learning research focuses on methods for learning, optimizing, and integrating unknown functions that are difficult or costly to evaluate. A popular Bayesian approach to this problem uses a Gaussian process (GP) to construct a posterior distribution over the function of interest given a set of observed measurements, and selects new points to evaluate using the statistics of this posterior. Here we extend these methods to exploit derivative information from the unknown function. We describe methods for Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian quadrature (BQ) in settings where first and second derivatives may be evaluated along with the function itself. We perform sampling-based inference in order to incorporate uncertainty over hyperparameters, and show that both hyperparameter and function uncertainty decrease much more rapidly when using derivative information. Moreover, we introduce techniques for overcoming ill-conditioning issues that have plagued earlier methods for gradient-enhanced Gaussian processes and kriging. We illustrate the efficacy of these methods using applications to real and simulated Bayesian optimization and quadrature problems, and show that exploting derivatives can provide substantial gains over standard methods.

1507.04513v1	Variational methods have been recently considered for scaling the training process of Gaussian process classifiers to large datasets. As an alternative, we describe here how to train these classifiers efficiently using expectation propagation. The proposed method allows for handling datasets with millions of data instances. More precisely, it can be used for (i) training in a distributed fashion where the data instances are sent to different nodes in which the required computations are carried out, and for (ii) maximizing an estimate of the marginal likelihood using a stochastic approximation of the gradient. Several experiments indicate that the method described is competitive with the variational approach.	Scalable Gaussian Process Classification via Expectation Propagation
1702.01000v2	Forward regression is a statistical model selection and estimation procedure which inductively selects covariates that add predictive power into a working statistical regression model. Once a model is selected, unknown regression parameters are estimated by least squares. This paper analyzes forward regression in high-dimensional sparse linear models. Probabilistic bounds for prediction error norm and number of selected covariates are proved. The analysis in this paper gives sharp rates and does not require beta-min or irrepresentability conditions.	Sharp Convergence Rates for Forward Regression in High-Dimensional  Sparse Linear Models
1710.07973v1	In this paper, the problem of one-bit compressed sensing (OBCS) is formulated as a problem in probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. It is shown that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC-) dimension of the set of half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ generated by $k$-sparse vectors is bounded below by $k \lg (n/k)$ and above by $2k \lg (n/k)$, plus some round-off terms. By coupling this estimate with well-established results in PAC learning theory, we show that a consistent algorithm can recover a $k$-sparse vector with $O(k \lg (n/k))$ measurements, given only the signs of the measurement vector. This result holds for \textit{all} probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is further shown that random sign-flipping errors result only in an increase in the constant in the $O(k \lg (n/k))$ estimate. Because constructing a consistent algorithm is not straight-forward, we present a heuristic based on the $\ell_1$-norm support vector machine, and illustrate that its computational performance is superior to a currently popular method.	An Approach to One-Bit Compressed Sensing Based on Probably  Approximately Correct Learning Theory
1710.01406v2	This work constructs a hypothesis test for detecting whether an data-generating function $h: R^p \rightarrow R$ belongs to a specific reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_0$ , where the structure of $\mathcal{H}_0$ is only partially known. Utilizing the theory of reproducing kernels, we reduce this hypothesis to a simple one-sided score test for a scalar parameter, develop a testing procedure that is robust against the mis-specification of kernel functions, and also propose an ensemble-based estimator for the null model to guarantee test performance in small samples. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, we apply our test to the problem of detecting nonlinear interaction between groups of continuous features. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of our test under different data-generating functions and estimation strategies for the null model. Our results reveal interesting connections between notions in machine learning (model underfit/overfit) and those in statistical inference (i.e. Type I error/power of hypothesis test), and also highlight unexpected consequences of common model estimating strategies (e.g. estimating kernel hyperparameters using maximum likelihood estimation) on model inference.

1403.6499v2	In this paper, we consider low rank matrix estimation using either matrix-version Dantzig Selector $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^d$ or matrix-version LASSO estimator $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^L$. We consider sub-Gaussian measurements, $i.e.$, the measurements $X_1,\ldots,X_n\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ have $i.i.d.$ sub-Gaussian entries. Suppose $\textrm{rank}(A_0)=r$. We proved that, when $n\geq Cm[r^2\vee r\log(m)\log(n)]$ for some $C>0$, both $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^d$ and $\hat{A}_{\lambda}^L$ can obtain optimal upper bounds(except some logarithmic terms) for estimation accuracy under spectral norm. By applying metric entropy of Grassmann manifolds, we construct (near) matching minimax lower bound for estimation accuracy under spectral norm. We also give upper bounds and matching minimax lower bound(except some logarithmic terms) for estimation accuracy under Schatten-q norm for every $1\leq q\leq\infty$. As a direct corollary, we show both upper bounds and minimax lower bounds of estimation accuracy under Ky-Fan-k norms for every $1\leq k\leq m$.

1510.05257v2	We introduce a multivariate stochastic volatility model for asset returns that imposes no restrictions to the structure of the volatility matrix and treats all its elements as functions of latent stochastic processes. When the number of assets is prohibitively large, we propose a factor multivariate stochastic volatility model in which the variances and correlations of the factors evolve stochastically over time. Inference is achieved via a carefully designed feasible and scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that combines two computationally important ingredients: it utilizes invariant to the prior Metropolis proposal densities for simultaneously updating all latent paths and has quadratic, rather than cubic, computational complexity when evaluating the multivariate normal densities required. We apply our modelling and computational methodology to $571$ stock daily returns of Euro STOXX index for data over a period of $10$ years. MATLAB software for this paper is available at this http URL	Scalable inference for a full multivariate stochastic volatility model
1010.0772v1	We consider the problem of learning a binary classifier from a training set of positive and unlabeled examples, both in the inductive and in the transductive setting. This problem, often referred to as \emph{PU learning}, differs from the standard supervised classification problem by the lack of negative examples in the training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous situation in many applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking, when we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data sharing the same property among a large and easily available pool of unlabeled data. We propose a conceptually simple method, akin to bagging, to approach both inductive and transductive PU learning problems, by converting them into series of supervised binary classification problems discriminating the known positive examples from random subsamples of the unlabeled set. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of the method on simulated and real data, where it performs at least as well as existing methods while being faster.

1512.03300v1	Topic models are popular for modeling discrete data (e.g., texts, images, videos, links), and provide an efficient way to discover hidden structures/semantics in massive data. One of the core problems in this field is the posterior inference for individual data instances. This problem is particularly important in streaming environments, but is often intractable. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) for recovering sparse solutions to posterior inference. From detailed elucidation of both theoretical and practical aspects, FW exhibits many interesting properties which are beneficial to topic modeling. We then employ FW to design fast methods, including ML-FW, for learning latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) at large scales. Extensive experiments show that to reach the same predictiveness level, ML-FW can perform tens to thousand times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods for learning LDA from massive/streaming data.

1411.0939v1	"The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a ubiquitous, flexible Bayesian nonparametric statistical model. However, full probabilistic inference in this model is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques such as Gibb's sampling are required. As a result, DPM-based methods, which have considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which computational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they would not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware, where computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop simplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference algorithms for DPMs. This algorithm is as simple as K-means clustering, performs in experiments as well as Gibb's sampling, while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort. Unlike related small variance asymptotics, our algorithm is non-degenerate and so inherits the ""rich get richer"" property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate closed-form likelihood which enables standard tools such as cross-validation to be used. This is a well-posed approximation to the MAP solution of the probabilistic DPM model."	Simple approximate MAP Inference for Dirichlet processes
0911.5367v2	This survey is an introduction to positive definite kernels and the set of methods they have inspired in the machine learning literature, namely kernel methods. We first discuss some properties of positive definite kernels as well as reproducing kernel Hibert spaces, the natural extension of the set of functions $\{k(x,\cdot),x\in\mathcal{X}\}$ associated with a kernel $k$ defined on a space $\mathcal{X}$. We discuss at length the construction of kernel functions that take advantage of well-known statistical models. We provide an overview of numerous data-analysis methods which take advantage of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and discuss the idea of combining several kernels to improve the performance on certain tasks. We also provide a short cookbook of different kernels which are particularly useful for certain data-types such as images, graphs or speech segments.	Positive Definite Kernels in Machine Learning
1202.2169v3	In this paper, we propose a semiparametric approach, named nonparanormal skeptic, for efficiently and robustly estimating high dimensional undirected graphical models. To achieve modeling flexibility, we consider Gaussian Copula graphical models (or the nonparanormal) as proposed by Liu et al. (2009). To achieve estimation robustness, we exploit nonparametric rank-based correlation coefficient estimators, including Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau. In high dimensional settings, we prove that the nonparanormal skeptic achieves the optimal parametric rate of convergence in both graph and parameter estimation. This celebrating result suggests that the Gaussian copula graphical models can be used as a safe replacement of the popular Gaussian graphical models, even when the data are truly Gaussian. Besides theoretical analysis, we also conduct thorough numerical simulations to compare different estimators for their graph recovery performance under both ideal and noisy settings. The proposed methods are then applied on a large-scale genomic dataset to illustrate their empirical usefulness. The R language software package huge implementing the proposed methods is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network: this http URL r-project.org/.

1111.1037v2	Motivated by multi-task machine learning with Banach spaces, we propose the notion of vector-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBS). Basic properties of the spaces and the associated reproducing kernels are investigated. We also present feature map constructions and several concrete examples of vector-valued RKBS. The theory is then applied to multi-task machine learning. Especially, the representer theorem and characterization equations for the minimizer of regularized learning schemes in vector-valued RKBS are established.

1611.00798v1	Many machine learning algorithms require precise estimates of covariance matrices. The sample covariance matrix performs poorly in high-dimensional settings, which has stimulated the development of alternative methods, the majority based on factor models and shrinkage. Recent work of Ledoit and Wolf has extended the shrinkage framework to Nonlinear Shrinkage (NLS), a more powerful covariance estimator based on Random Matrix Theory. Our contribution shows that, contrary to claims in the literature, cross-validation based covariance matrix estimation (CVC) yields comparable performance at strongly reduced complexity and runtime. On two real world data sets, we show that the CVC estimator yields superior results than competing shrinkage and factor based methods.	Cross-validation based Nonlinear Shrinkage
1406.3166v2	We analyze the generalization and robustness of the batched weighted average algorithm for V-geometrically ergodic Markov data. This algorithm is a good alternative to the empirical risk minimization algorithm when the latter suffers from overfitting or when optimizing the empirical risk is hard. For the generalization of the algorithm, we prove a PAC-style bound on the training sample size for the expected $L_1$-loss to converge to the optimal loss when training data are V-geometrically ergodic Markov chains. For the robustness, we show that if the training target variable's values contain bounded noise, then the generalization bound of the algorithm deviates at most by the range of the noise. Our results can be applied to the regression problem, the classification problem, and the case where there exists an unknown deterministic target hypothesis.

0810.3724v2	The problem of Hybrid Linear Modeling (HLM) is to model and segment data using a mixture of affine subspaces. Different strategies have been proposed to solve this problem, however, rigorous analysis justifying their performance is missing. This paper suggests the Theoretical Spectral Curvature Clustering (TSCC) algorithm for solving the HLM problem, and provides careful analysis to justify it. The TSCC algorithm is practically a combination of Govindu's multi-way spectral clustering framework (CVPR 2005) and Ng et al.'s spectral clustering algorithm (NIPS 2001). The main result of this paper states that if the given data is sampled from a mixture of distributions concentrated around affine subspaces, then with high sampling probability the TSCC algorithm segments well the different underlying clusters. The goodness of clustering depends on the within-cluster errors, the between-clusters interaction, and a tuning parameter applied by TSCC. The proof also provides new insights for the analysis of Ng et al. (NIPS 2001).	Foundations of a Multi-way Spectral Clustering Framework for Hybrid  Linear Modeling
1401.6740v1	Sparse classifiers such as the support vector machines (SVM) are efficient in test-phases because the classifier is characterized only by a subset of the samples called support vectors (SVs), and the rest of the samples (non SVs) have no influence on the classification result. However, the advantage of the sparsity has not been fully exploited in training phases because it is generally difficult to know which sample turns out to be SV beforehand. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called safe sample screening that enables us to identify a subset of the non-SVs and screen them out prior to the training phase. Our approach is different from existing heuristic approaches in the sense that the screened samples are guaranteed to be non-SVs at the optimal solution. We investigate the advantage of the safe sample screening approach through intensive numerical experiments, and demonstrate that it can substantially decrease the computational cost of the state-of-the-art SVM solvers such as LIBSVM. In the current big data era, we believe that safe sample screening would be of great practical importance since the data size can be reduced without sacrificing the optimality of the final solution.	Safe Sample Screening for Support Vector Machines
1012.3407v1	Translating potential disease biomarkers between multi-species 'omics' experiments is a new direction in biomedical research. The existing methods are limited to simple experimental setups such as basic healthy-diseased comparisons. Most of these methods also require an a priori matching of the variables (e.g., genes or metabolites) between the species. However, many experiments have a complicated multi-way experimental design often involving irregularly-sampled time-series measurements, and for instance metabolites do not always have known matchings between organisms. We introduce a Bayesian modelling framework for translating between multiple species the results from 'omics' experiments having a complex multi-way, time-series experimental design. The underlying assumption is that the unknown matching can be inferred from the response of the variables to multiple covariates including time.	Translating biomarkers between multi-way time-series experiments
1609.04388v1	Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that generates proposals for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by simulating the dynamics of a Hamiltonian system. However, HMC is sensitive to large time discretizations and performs poorly if there is a mismatch between the spatial geometry of the target distribution and the scales of the momentum distribution. In particular the mass matrix of HMC is hard to tune well. In order to alleviate these problems we propose relativistic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a version of HMC based on relativistic dynamics that introduce a maximum velocity on particles. We also derive stochastic gradient versions of the algorithm and show that the resulting algorithms bear interesting relationships to gradient clipping, RMSprop, Adagrad and Adam, popular optimisation methods in deep learning. Based on this, we develop relativistic stochastic gradient descent by taking the zero-temperature limit of relativistic stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In experiments we show that the relativistic algorithms perform better than classical Newtonian variants and Adam.	Relativistic Monte Carlo
1310.8612v1	Incorporating spatial information into hyperspectral unmixing procedures has been shown to have positive effects, due to the inherent spatial-spectral duality in hyperspectral scenes. Current research works that consider spatial information are mainly focused on the linear mixing model. In this paper, we investigate a variational approach to incorporating spatial correlation into a nonlinear unmixing procedure. A nonlinear algorithm operating in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, associated with an $\ell_1$ local variation norm as the spatial regularizer, is derived. Experimental results, with both synthetic and real data, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

1610.08466v1	"Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball teams traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear dynamics. We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into segments that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS), we present a new model class that not only discovers these dynamical units, but also explains how their switching behavior depends on observations or continuous latent states. These ""recurrent"" switching linear dynamical systems provide further insight by discovering the conditions under which each unit is deployed, something that traditional SLDS models fail to do. We leverage recent algorithmic advances in approximate inference to make Bayesian inference in these models easy, fast, and scalable."	Recurrent switching linear dynamical systems

1710.05751v2	Time series forecasting is widely used in a multitude of domains. In this paper, we present four models to predict the stock price using the SPX index as input time series data. The martingale and ordinary linear models require the strongest assumption in stationarity which we use as baseline models. The generalized linear model requires lesser assumptions but is unable to outperform the martingale. In empirical testing, the RNN model performs the best comparing to other two models, because it will update the input through LSTM instantaneously, but also does not beat the martingale. In addition, we introduce an online to batch algorithm and discrepancy measure to inform readers the newest research in time series predicting method, which doesn't require any stationarity or non mixing assumptions in time series data. Finally, to apply these forecasting to practice, we introduce basic trading strategies that can create Win win and Zero sum situations.	Time Series Prediction : Predicting Stock Price
1103.0102v2	"In multi-label learning, each sample is associated with several labels. Existing works indicate that exploring correlations between labels improve the prediction performance. However, embedding the label correlations into the training process significantly increases the problem size. Moreover, the mapping of the label structure in the feature space is not clear. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label learning method ""Structured Decomposition + Group Sparsity (SDGS)"". In SDGS, we learn a feature subspace for each label from the structured decomposition of the training data, and predict the labels of a new sample from its group sparse representation on the multi-subspace obtained from the structured decomposition. In particular, in the training stage, we decompose the data matrix $X\in R^{n\times p}$ as $X=\sum_{i=1}^kL^i+S$, wherein the rows of $L^i$ associated with samples that belong to label $i$ are nonzero and consist a low-rank matrix, while the other rows are all-zeros, the residual $S$ is a sparse matrix. The row space of $L_i$ is the feature subspace corresponding to label $i$. This decomposition can be efficiently obtained via randomized optimization. In the prediction stage, we estimate the group sparse representation of a new sample on the multi-subspace via group \emph{lasso}. The nonzero representation coefficients tend to concentrate on the subspaces of labels that the sample belongs to, and thus an effective prediction can be obtained. We evaluate SDGS on several real datasets and compare it with popular methods. Results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SDGS."

1310.1562v4	We proposed a new statistical dependency measure called Copula Dependency Coefficient(CDC) for two sets of variables based on copula. It is robust to outliers, easy to implement, powerful and appropriate to high-dimensional variables. These properties are important in many applications. Experimental results show that CDC can detect the dependence between variables in both additive and non-additive models.	Dependence Measure for non-additive model
1301.6915v2	We study high-dimensional asymptotic performance limits of binary supervised classification problems where the class conditional densities are Gaussian with unknown means and covariances and the number of signal dimensions scales faster than the number of labeled training samples. We show that the Bayes error, namely the minimum attainable error probability with complete distributional knowledge and equally likely classes, can be arbitrarily close to zero and yet the limiting minimax error probability of every supervised learning algorithm is no better than a random coin toss. In contrast to related studies where the classification difficulty (Bayes error) is made to vanish, we hold it constant when taking high-dimensional limits. In contrast to VC-dimension based minimax lower bounds that consider the worst case error probability over all distributions that have a fixed Bayes error, our worst case is over the family of Gaussian distributions with constant Bayes error. We also show that a nontrivial asymptotic minimax error probability can only be attained for parametric subsets of zero measure (in a suitable measure space). These results expose the fundamental importance of prior knowledge and suggest that unless we impose strong structural constraints, such as sparsity, on the parametric space, supervised learning may be ineffective in high dimensional small sample settings.	An Impossibility Result for High Dimensional Supervised Learning
1702.07398v2	We present an approach to deep estimation of discrete conditional probability distributions. Such models have several applications, including generative modeling of audio, image, and video data. Our approach combines two main techniques: dyadic partitioning and graph-based smoothing of the discrete space. By recursively decomposing each dimension into a series of binary splits and smoothing over the resulting distribution using graph-based trend filtering, we impose a strict structure to the model and achieve much higher sample efficiency. We demonstrate the advantages of our model through a series of benchmarks on both synthetic and real-world datasets, in some cases reducing the error by nearly half in comparison to other popular methods in the literature. All of our models are implemented in Tensorflow and publicly available at this https URL .	Deep Nonparametric Estimation of Discrete Conditional Distributions via  Smoothed Dyadic Partitioning
1402.6262v5	In this paper, we are concerned with obtaining distribution-free concentration inequalities for mixture of independent Bernoulli variables that incorporate a notion of variance. Missing mass is the total probability mass associated to the outcomes that have not been seen in a given sample which is an important quantity that connects density estimates obtained from a sample to the population for discrete distributions. Therefore, we are specifically motivated to apply our method to study the concentration of missing mass - which can be expressed as a mixture of Bernoulli - in a novel way. We not only derive - for the first time - Bernstein-like large deviation bounds for the missing mass whose exponents behave almost linearly with respect to deviation size, but also sharpen McAllester and Ortiz (2003) and Berend and Kontorovich (2013) for large sample sizes in the case of small deviations which is the most interesting case in learning theory. In the meantime, our approach shows that the heterogeneity issue introduced in McAllester and Ortiz (2003) is resolvable in the case of missing mass in the sense that one can use standard inequalities but it may not lead to strong results. Thus, we postulate that our results are general and can be applied to provide potentially sharp Bernstein-like bounds under some constraints.

0806.2646v1	We analyze the performance of a class of manifold-learning algorithms that find their output by minimizing a quadratic form under some normalization constraints. This class consists of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Laplacian Eigenmap, Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE), and Diffusion maps. We present and prove conditions on the manifold that are necessary for the success of the algorithms. Both the finite sample case and the limit case are analyzed. We show that there are simple manifolds in which the necessary conditions are violated, and hence the algorithms cannot recover the underlying manifolds. Finally, we present numerical results that demonstrate our claims.	Manifold Learning: The Price of Normalization
1711.04425v1	Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a nonparametric inference method, which iteratively transports a set of randomly initialized particles to approximate a differentiable target distribution, along the direction that maximally decreases the KL divergence within a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Compared to Monte Carlo methods, SVGD is particle-efficient because of the repulsive force induced by kernels. In this paper, we develop the first analysis about the high dimensional performance of SVGD and emonstrate that the repulsive force drops at least polynomially with increasing dimensions, which results in poor marginal approximation. To improve the marginal inference of SVGD, we propose Marginal SVGD (M-SVGD), which incorporates structural information described by a Markov random field (MRF) into kernels. M-SVGD inherits the particle efficiency of SVGD and can be used as a general purpose marginal inference tool for MRFs. Experimental results on grid based Markov random fields show the effectiveness of our methods.	Analyzing and Improving Stein Variational Gradient Descent for  High-dimensional Marginal Inference
1509.02088v1	This text investigates relations between two well-known family of algorithms, matrix factorisations and recursive linear filters, by describing a probabilistic model in which approximate inference corresponds to a matrix factorisation algorithm. Using the probabilistic model, we derive a matrix factorisation algorithm as a recursive linear filter. More precisely, we derive a matrix-variate recursive linear filter in order to perform efficient inference in high dimensions. We also show that it is possible to interpret our algorithm as a nontrivial stochastic gradient algorithm. Demonstrations and comparisons on an image restoration task are given.

1704.02578v2	We study strictly proper scoring rules in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We propose a general Kernel Scoring rule and associated Kernel Divergence. We consider conditions under which the Kernel Score is strictly proper. We then demonstrate that the Kernel Score includes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy as a special case. We also consider the connections between the Kernel Score and the minimum risk of a proper loss function. We show that the Kernel Score incorporates more information pertaining to the projected embedded distributions compared to the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Finally, we show how to integrate the information provided from different Kernel Divergences, such as the proposed Bhattacharyya Kernel Divergence, using a one-class classifier for improved two-sample hypothesis testing results.

1506.00553v1	This paper examines the use of a residual bootstrap for bias correction in machine learning regression methods. Accounting for bias is an important obstacle in recent efforts to develop statistical inference for machine learning methods. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed bootstrap bias correction can lead to substantial improvements in both bias and predictive accuracy. In the context of ensembles of trees, we show that this correction can be approximated at only double the cost of training the original ensemble without introducing additional variance. Our method is shown to improve test-set accuracy over random forests by up to 70\% on example problems from the UCI repository.	Bootstrap Bias Corrections for Ensemble Methods
1202.3766v1	Recent reports have described that learning Bayesian networks are highly sensitive to the chosen equivalent sample size (ESS) in the Bayesian Dirichlet equivalence uniform (BDeu). This sensitivity often engenders some unstable or undesirable results. This paper describes some asymptotic analyses of BDeu to explain the reasons for the sensitivity and its effects. Furthermore, this paper presents a proposal for a robust learning score for ESS by eliminating the sensitive factors from the approximation of log-BDeu.

1709.04024v3	Discovering a correlation from one variable to another variable is of fundamental scientific and practical interest. While existing correlation measures are suitable for discovering average correlation, they fail to discover hidden or potential correlations. To bridge this gap, (i) we postulate a set of natural axioms that we expect a measure of potential correlation to satisfy; (ii) we show that the rate of information bottleneck, i.e., the hypercontractivity coefficient, satisfies all the proposed axioms; (iii) we provide a novel estimator to estimate the hypercontractivity coefficient from samples; and (iv) we provide numerical experiments demonstrating that this proposed estimator discovers potential correlations among various indicators of WHO datasets, is robust in discovering gene interactions from gene expression time series data, and is statistically more powerful than the estimators for other correlation measures in binary hypothesis testing of canonical examples of potential correlations.

1204.4708v1	We present an new sequential Monte Carlo sampler for coalescent based Bayesian hierarchical clustering. Our model is appropriate for modeling non-i.i.d. data and offers a substantial reduction of computational cost when compared to the original sampler without resorting to approximations. We also propose a quadratic complexity approximation that in practice shows almost no loss in performance compared to its counterpart. We show that as a byproduct of our formulation, we obtain a greedy algorithm that exhibits performance improvement over other greedy algorithms, particularly in small data sets. In order to exploit the correlation structure of the data, we describe how to incorporate Gaussian process priors in the model as a flexible way to model non-i.i.d. data. Results on artificial and real data show significant improvements over closely related approaches.	Efficient hierarchical clustering for continuous data
1706.08203v2	We present two deep generative models based on Variational Autoencoders to improve the accuracy of drug response prediction. Our models, Perturbation Variational Autoencoder and its semi-supervised extension, Drug Response Variational Autoencoder (Dr.VAE), learn latent representation of the underlying gene states before and after drug application that depend on: (i) drug-induced biological change of each gene and (ii) overall treatment response outcome. Our VAE-based models outperform the current published benchmarks in the field by anywhere from 3 to 11% AUROC and 2 to 30% AUPR. In addition, we found that better reconstruction accuracy does not necessarily lead to improvement in classification accuracy and that jointly trained models perform better than models that minimize reconstruction error independently.

0908.2284v1	We introduce a new nearest-prototype classifier, the prototype vector machine (PVM). It arises from a combinatorial optimization problem which we cast as a variant of the set cover problem. We propose two algorithms for approximating its solution. The PVM selects a relatively small number of representative points which can then be used for classification. It contains 1-NN as a special case. The method is compatible with any dissimilarity measure, making it amenable to situations in which the data are not embedded in an underlying feature space or in which using a non-Euclidean metric is desirable. Indeed, we demonstrate on the much studied ZIP code data how the PVM can reap the benefits of a problem-specific metric. In this example, the PVM outperforms the highly successful 1-NN with tangent distance, and does so retaining fewer than half of the data points. This example highlights the strengths of the PVM in yielding a low-error, highly interpretable model. Additionally, we apply the PVM to a protein classification problem in which a kernel-based distance is used.	Classification by Set Cover: The Prototype Vector Machine
1111.6254v1	We describe many vantage points on the Baire metric and its use in clustering data, or its use in preprocessing and structuring data in order to support search and retrieval operations. In some cases, we proceed directly to clusters and do not directly determine the distances. We show how a hierarchical clustering can be read directly from one pass through the data. We offer insights also on practical implications of precision of data measurement. As a mechanism for treating multidimensional data, including very high dimensional data, we use random projections.

1509.02873v1	In this study, we propose an automatic learning method for variables selection based on Lasso in epidemiology context. One of the aim of this approach is to overcome the pretreatment of experts in medicine and epidemiology on collected data. These pretreatment consist in recoding some variables and to choose some interactions based on expertise. The approach proposed uses all available explanatory variables without treatment and generate automatically all interactions between them. This lead to high dimension. We use Lasso, one of the robust methods of variable selection in high dimension. To avoid over fitting a two levels cross-validation is used. Because the target variable is account variable and the lasso estimators are biased, variables selected by lasso are debiased by a GLM and used to predict the distribution of the main vector of malaria which is Anopheles. Results show that only few climatic and environmental variables are the mains factors associated to the malaria risk exposure.

1610.05956v1	The determination of cluster centers generally depends on the scale that we use to analyze the data to be clustered. Inappropriate scale usually leads to unreasonable cluster centers and thus unreasonable results. In this study, we first consider the similarity of elements in the data as the connectivity of nodes in an undirected graph, then present the concept of a connection center and regard it as the cluster center of the data. Based on this definition, the determination of cluster centers and the assignment of class are very simple, natural and effective. One more crucial finding is that the cluster centers of different scales can be obtained easily by the different powers of a similarity matrix and the change of power from small to large leads to the dynamic evolution of cluster centers from local (microscopic) to global (microscopic). Further, in this process of evolution, the number of categories changes discontinuously, which means that the presented method can automatically skip the unreasonable number of clusters, suggest appropriate observation scales and provide corresponding cluster results.

1709.05552v1	We consider a graphical model where a multivariate normal vector is associated with each node of the underlying graph and estimate the graphical structure. We minimize a loss function obtained by regressing the vector at each node on those at the remaining ones under a group penalty. We show that the proposed estimator can be computed by a fast convex optimization algorithm. We show that as the sample size increases, the estimated regression coefficients and the correct graphical structure are correctly estimated with probability tending to one. By extensive simulations, we show the superiority of the proposed method over comparable procedures. We apply the technique on two real datasets. The first one is to identify gene and protein networks showing up in cancer cell lines, and the second one is to reveal the connections among different industries in the US.

1802.09596v1	Modern machine learning algorithms for classification or regression such as gradient boosting, random forest and neural networks involve a number of parameters that have to be fixed before running them. Such parameters are commonly denoted as hyperparameters in machine learning, a terminology we also adopt here. The term tuning parameter is also frequently used to denote parameters that should be carefully tuned, i.e. optimized with respect to performance. The users of these algorithms can use defaults of these hyperparameters that are specified in the employed software package, set them to alternative specific values or use a tuning strategy to choose them appropriately for the specific dataset at hand. In this context, we define tunability as the amount of performance gain that can be achieved by setting the considered hyperparameter to the best possible value instead of the default value. The goal of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, we formalize the problem of tuning from a statistical point of view and suggest general measures quantifying the tunability of hyperparameters of algorithms. Secondly, we conduct a large-scale benchmarking study based on 38 datasets from the OpenML platform (Vanschoren et al., 2013) using six of the most common machine learning algorithms for classification and regression and apply our measures to assess the tunability of their parameters. The results yield interesting insights into the investigated hyperparameters that in some cases allow general conclusions on their tunability. Our results may help users of the algorithms to decide whether it is worth to conduct a possibly time consuming tuning strategy, to focus on the most important hyperparameters and to chose adequate hyperparameter spaces for tuning.

1310.3004v1	Classification is an important topic in statistics and machine learning with great potential in many real applications. In this paper, we investigate two popular large margin classification methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD), under two contexts: the high-dimensional, low-sample size data and the imbalanced data. A unified family of classification machines, the FLexible Assortment MachinE (FLAME) is proposed, within which DWD and SVM are special cases. The FLAME family helps to identify the similarities and differences between SVM and DWD. It is well known that many classifiers overfit the data in the high-dimensional setting; and others are sensitive to the imbalanced data, that is, the class with a larger sample size overly influences the classifier and pushes the decision boundary towards the minority class. SVM is resistant to the imbalanced data issue, but it overfits high-dimensional data sets by showing the undesired data-piling phenomena. The DWD method was proposed to improve SVM in the high-dimensional setting, but its decision boundary is sensitive to the imbalanced ratio of sample sizes. Our FLAME family helps to understand an intrinsic connection between SVM and DWD, and improves both methods by providing a better trade-off between sensitivity to the imbalanced data and overfitting the high-dimensional data. Several asymptotic properties of the FLAME classifiers are studied. Simulations and real data applications are investigated to illustrate the usefulness of the FLAME classifiers.

1004.1341v1	"The outcome of a functional genomics pipeline is usually a partial list of genomic features, ranked by their relevance in modelling biological phenotype in terms of a classification or regression model. Due to resampling protocols or just within a meta-analysis comparison, instead of one list it is often the case that sets of alternative feature lists (possibly of different lengths) are obtained. Here we introduce a method, based on the algebraic theory of symmetric groups, for studying the variability between lists (""list stability"") in the case of lists of unequal length. We provide algorithms evaluating stability for lists embedded in the full feature set or just limited to the features occurring in the partial lists. The method is demonstrated first on synthetic data in a gene filtering task and then for finding gene profiles on a recent prostate cancer dataset."

1501.01029v2	This paper is concerned with the problems of interaction screening and nonlinear classification in a high-dimensional setting. We propose a two-step procedure, IIS-SQDA, where in the first step an innovated interaction screening (IIS) approach based on transforming the original $p$-dimensional feature vector is proposed, and in the second step a sparse quadratic discriminant analysis (SQDA) is proposed for further selecting important interactions and main effects and simultaneously conducting classification. Our IIS approach screens important interactions by examining only $p$ features instead of all two-way interactions of order $O(p^2)$. Our theory shows that the proposed method enjoys sure screening property in interaction selection in the high-dimensional setting of $p$ growing exponentially with the sample size. In the selection and classification step, we establish a sparse inequality on the estimated coefficient vector for QDA and prove that the classification error of our procedure can be upper-bounded by the oracle classification error plus some smaller order term. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis show that our proposal compares favorably with existing methods in interaction selection and high-dimensional classification.

1606.07240v3	We study a two-level multiview learning with more than two views under the PAC-Bayesian framework. This approach, sometimes referred as late fusion, consists in learning sequentially multiple view-specific classifiers at the first level, and then combining these view-specific classifiers at the second level. Our main theoretical result is a generalization bound on the risk of the majority vote which exhibits a term of diversity in the predictions of the view-specific classifiers. From this result it comes out that controlling the trade-off between diversity and accuracy is a key element for multiview learning, which complements other results in multiview learning. Finally, we experiment our principle on multiview datasets extracted from the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collection.	PAC-Bayesian Analysis for a two-step Hierarchical Multiview Learning  Approach
1711.05957v1	Recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective paradigm for human-powered large scale problem solving in various domains. However, task requester usually has a limited amount of budget, thus it is desirable to have a policy to wisely allocate the budget to achieve better quality. In this paper, we study the principle of information maximization for active sampling strategies in the framework of HodgeRank, an approach based on Hodge Decomposition of pairwise ranking data with multiple workers. The principle exhibits two scenarios of active sampling: Fisher information maximization that leads to unsupervised sampling based on a sequential maximization of graph algebraic connectivity without considering labels; and Bayesian information maximization that selects samples with the largest information gain from prior to posterior, which gives a supervised sampling involving the labels collected. Experiments show that the proposed methods boost the sampling efficiency as compared to traditional sampling schemes and are thus valuable to practical crowdsourcing experiments.

1605.09658v4	In the context high-dimensionnal predictive models, we consider the problem of optimizing the sum of a smooth convex loss and a non-smooth convex penalty, whose proximal operator is known, and a non-smooth convex structured penalties such as total variation, or overlapping group lasso. We propose to smooth the structured penalty, since it allows a generic framework in which a large range of non-smooth convex structured penalties can be minimized without computing their proximal operators that are either not known or expensive to compute. The problem can be minimized with an accelerated proximal gradient method to benefit of (non-smoothed) sparsity-inducing penalties. We propose an expression of the duality gap to control the convergence of the global non-smooth problem. This expression is applicable to a large range of structured penalties. However, smoothing methods have many limitations that the proposed solver aims to overcome. Therefore, we propose a continuation algorithm, called CONESTA, that dynamically generates a decreasing sequence of smoothing parameters in order to maintain the optimal convergence speed towards any globally desired precision. At each continuation step, the aforementioned duality gap provides the current error and thus the next smaller prescribed precision. Given this precision, we propose a expression to calculate the optimal smoothing parameter, that minimizes the number of iterations to reach such precision. We demonstrate that CONESTA achieves an improved convergence rate compared to classical (without continuation) proximal gradient smoothing. Moreover, experiments conducted on both simulated and high-dimensional neuroimaging (MRI) data, exhibit that CONESTA significantly outperforms the excessive gap method, ADMM, classical proximal gradient smoothing and inexact FISTA in terms of convergence speed and/or precision of the solution.

1606.05390v1	Tree ensembles, such as random forest and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance, whereas their interpretability is critically limited. In this paper, we propose a post processing method that improves the model interpretability of tree ensembles. After learning a complex tree ensembles in a standard way, we approximate it by a simpler model that is interpretable for human. To obtain the simpler model, we derive the EM algorithm minimizing the KL divergence from the complex ensemble. A synthetic experiment showed that a complicated tree ensemble was approximated reasonably as interpretable.	Making Tree Ensembles Interpretable
1712.01081v1	In this work, we analyze the problem of adoption of mobile money in Pakistan by using the call detail records of a major telecom company as our input. Our results highlight the fact that different sections of the society have different patterns of adoption of digital financial services but user mobility related features are the most important one when it comes to adopting and using mobile money services.

0908.3321v1	We propose an extension of the concept of Expected Improvement criterion commonly used in Kriging based optimization. We extend it for more complex Kriging models, e.g. models using derivatives. The target field of application are CFD problems, where objective function are extremely expensive to evaluate, but the theory can be also used in other fields.

1501.05200v1	We are motivated by problems that arise in a number of applications such as Online Marketing and Explosives detection, where the observations are usually modeled using Poisson statistics. We model each observation as a Poisson random variable whose mean is a sparse linear superposition of known patterns. Unlike many conventional problems observations here are not identically distributed since they are associated with different sensing modalities. We analyze the performance of a Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder, which for our Poisson setting involves a non-linear optimization but yet is computationally tractable. We derive fundamental sample complexity bounds for sparse recovery when the measurements are contaminated with Poisson noise. In contrast to the least-squares linear regression setting with Gaussian noise, we observe that in addition to sparsity, the scale of the parameters also fundamentally impacts $\ell_2$ error in the Poisson setting. We show tightness of our upper bounds both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, we derive a minimax matching lower bound on the mean-squared error and show that our constrained ML decoder is minimax optimal for this regime.

1706.09751v1	Neural network based generative models with discriminative components are a powerful approach for semi-supervised learning. However, these techniques a) cannot account for model uncertainty in the estimation of the model's discriminative component and b) lack flexibility to capture complex stochastic patterns in the label generation process. To avoid these problems, we first propose to use a discriminative component with stochastic inputs for increased noise flexibility. We show how an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure can marginalize the stochastic inputs when inferring missing labels in this model. Following this, we extend the discriminative component to be fully Bayesian and produce estimates of uncertainty in its parameter values. This opens the door for semi-supervised Bayesian active learning.	Bayesian Semisupervised Learning with Deep Generative Models
1205.2658v1	In intractable, undirected graphical models, an intuitive way of creating structured mean field approximations is to select an acyclic tractable subgraph. We show that the hardness of computing the objective function and gradient of the mean field objective qualitatively depends on a simple graph property. If the tractable subgraph has this property- we call such subgraphs v-acyclic-a very fast block coordinate ascent algorithm is possible. If not, optimization is harder, but we show a new algorithm based on the construction of an auxiliary exponential family that can be used to make inference possible in this case as well. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each regime and compare the algorithms empirically.	Optimization of Structured Mean Field Objectives
1006.1673v1	The problem of distributed learning and channel access is considered in a cognitive network with multiple secondary users. The availability statistics of the channels are initially unknown to the secondary users and are estimated using sensing decisions. There is no explicit information exchange or prior agreement among the secondary users. We propose policies for distributed learning and access which achieve order-optimal cognitive system throughput (number of successful secondary transmissions) under self play, i.e., when implemented at all the secondary users. Equivalently, our policies minimize the regret in distributed learning and access. We first consider the scenario when the number of secondary users is known to the policy, and prove that the total regret is logarithmic in the number of transmission slots. Our distributed learning and access policy achieves order-optimal regret by comparing to an asymptotic lower bound for regret under any uniformly-good learning and access policy. We then consider the case when the number of secondary users is fixed but unknown, and is estimated through feedback. We propose a policy in this scenario whose asymptotic sum regret which grows slightly faster than logarithmic in the number of transmission slots.

1109.0455v1	This paper proposes a novel kernel approach to linear dimension reduction for supervised learning. The purpose of the dimension reduction is to find directions in the input space to explain the output as effectively as possible. The proposed method uses an estimator for the gradient of regression function, based on the covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In comparison with other existing methods, the proposed one has wide applicability without strong assumptions on the distributions or the type of variables, and uses computationally simple eigendecomposition. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully finds the effective directions with efficient computation.	Gradient-based kernel dimension reduction for supervised learning
1502.01368v3	The sparse representation classifier (SRC) has been utilized in various classification problems, which makes use of L1 minimization and is shown to work well for image recognition problems that satisfy a subspace assumption. In this paper we propose a new implementation of SRC via screening, establish its equivalence to the original SRC under regularity conditions, and prove its classification consistency under a latent subspace model. The results are demonstrated via simulations and real data experiments, where the new algorithm achieves comparable numerical performance but significantly faster.	Sparse Representation Classification Beyond L1 Minimization and the  Subspace Assumption
1604.01075v1	Many retailers today employ inventory management systems based on Re-Order Point Policies, most of which rely on the assumption that all decreases in product inventory levels result from product sales. Unfortunately, it usually happens that small but random quantities of the product get lost, stolen or broken without record as time passes, e.g., as a consequence of shoplifting. This is usual for retailers handling large varieties of inexpensive products, e.g., grocery stores. In turn, over time these discrepancies lead to stock freezing problems, i.e., situations where the system believes the stock is above the re-order point but the actual stock is at zero, and so no replenishments or sales occur. Motivated by these issues, we model the interaction between sales, losses, replenishments and inventory levels as a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), where the inventory levels are unobserved (i.e., hidden) variables we wish to estimate. We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the sale and loss distributions, which relies on solving a one-dimensional dynamic program for the E-step and on solving two separate one-dimensional nonlinear programs for the M-step.

1507.06350v7	Recent decades have seen an interest in prediction problems for which Bayesian methodology has been used ubiquitously. Sampling from or approximating the posterior predictive distribution in a Bayesian model allows one to make inferential statements about potentially observable random quantities given observed data. The purpose of this note is to use statistical decision theory as a basis to justify the use of a posterior predictive distribution for making a point prediction.	Admissibility of a posterior predictive decision rule
1711.02989v1	Gaussian multiplicative noise is commonly used as a stochastic regularisation technique in training of deterministic neural networks. A recent paper reinterpreted the technique as a specific algorithm for approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks; several extensions ensued. We show that the log-uniform prior used in all the above publications does not generally induce a proper posterior, and thus Bayesian inference in such models is ill-posed. Independent of the log-uniform prior, the correlated weight noise approximation has further issues leading to either infinite objective or high risk of overfitting. The above implies that the reported sparsity of obtained solutions cannot be explained by Bayesian or the related minimum description length arguments. We thus study the objective from a non-Bayesian perspective, provide its previously unknown analytical form which allows exact gradient evaluation, and show that the later proposed additive reparametrisation introduces minima not present in the original multiplicative parametrisation. Implications and future research directions are discussed.	Variational Gaussian Dropout is not Bayesian
1212.1780v1	Model selection is a crucial issue in machine-learning and a wide variety of penalisation methods (with possibly data dependent complexity penalties) have recently been introduced for this purpose. However their empirical performance is generally not well documented in the literature. It is the goal of this paper to investigate to which extent such recent techniques can be successfully used for the tuning of both the regularisation and kernel parameters in support vector regression (SVR) and the complexity measure in regression trees (CART). This task is traditionally solved via V-fold cross-validation (VFCV), which gives efficient results for a reasonable computational cost. A disadvantage however of VFCV is that the procedure is known to provide an asymptotically suboptimal risk estimate as the number of examples tends to infinity. Recently, a penalisation procedure called V-fold penalisation has been proposed to improve on VFCV, supported by theoretical arguments. Here we report on an extensive set of experiments comparing V-fold penalisation and VFCV for SVR/CART calibration on several benchmark datasets. We highlight cases in which VFCV and V-fold penalisation provide poor estimates of the risk respectively and introduce a modified penalisation technique to reduce the estimation error.

1307.0164v1	We study sparse principal component analysis for high dimensional vector autoregressive time series under a doubly asymptotic framework, which allows the dimension $d$ to scale with the series length $T$. We treat the transition matrix of time series as a nuisance parameter and directly apply sparse principal component analysis on multivariate time series as if the data are independent. We provide explicit non-asymptotic rates of convergence for leading eigenvector estimation and extend this result to principal subspace estimation. Our analysis illustrates that the spectral norm of the transition matrix plays an essential role in determining the final rates. We also characterize sufficient conditions under which sparse principal component analysis attains the optimal parametric rate. Our theoretical results are backed up by thorough numerical studies.

1112.5627v1	Often, high dimensional data lie close to a low-dimensional submanifold and it is of interest to understand the geometry of these submanifolds. The homology groups of a manifold are important topological invariants that provide an algebraic summary of the manifold. These groups contain rich topological information, for instance, about the connected components, holes, tunnels and sometimes the dimension of the manifold. In this paper, we consider the statistical problem of estimating the homology of a manifold from noisy samples under several different noise models. We derive upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk for this problem. Our upper bounds are based on estimators which are constructed from a union of balls of appropriate radius around carefully selected points. In each case we establish complementary lower bounds using Le Cam's lemma.	Minimax Rates for Homology Inference
1312.7559v7	We consider a problem of clustering a sequence of multinomial observations by way of a model selection criterion. We propose a form of a penalty term for the model selection procedure. Our approach subsumes both the conventional AIC and BIC criteria but also extends the conventional criteria in a way that it can be applicable also to a sequence of sparse multinomial observations, where even within a same cluster, the number of multinomial trials may be different for different observations. In addition, as a preliminary estimation step to maximum likelihood estimation, and more generally, to maximum $L_{q}$ estimation, we propose to use reduced rank projection in combination with non-negative factorization. We motivate our approach by showing that our model selection criterion and preliminary estimation step yield consistent estimates under simplifying assumptions. We also illustrate our approach through numerical experiments using real and simulated data.	A model selection approach for clustering a multinomial sequence with  non-negative factorization

0912.3268v1	Interest in multioutput kernel methods is increasing, whether under the guise of multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function over correlated output functions. One way of constructing such kernels is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence (2009) recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series.	Variational Inducing Kernels for Sparse Convolved Multiple Output  Gaussian Processes
1706.03673v2	Bayesian optimization (BO) methods are useful for optimizing functions that are expensive to evaluate, lack an analytical expression and whose evaluations can be contaminated by noise. These methods rely on a probabilistic model of the objective function, typically a Gaussian process (GP), upon which an acquisition function is built. This function guides the optimization process and measures the expected utility of performing an evaluation of the objective at a new point. GPs assume continous input variables. When this is not the case, such as when some of the input variables take integer values, one has to introduce extra approximations. A common approach is to round the suggested variable value to the closest integer before doing the evaluation of the objective. We show that this can lead to problems in the optimization process and describe a more principled approach to account for input variables that are integer-valued. We illustrate in both synthetic and a real experiments the utility of our approach, which significantly improves the results of standard BO methods on problems involving integer-valued variables.

1304.4672v3	We study low rank matrix and tensor completion and propose novel algorithms that employ adaptive sampling schemes to obtain strong performance guarantees. Our algorithms exploit adaptivity to identify entries that are highly informative for learning the column space of the matrix (tensor) and consequently, our results hold even when the row space is highly coherent, in contrast with previous analyses. In the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a $n \times n$ matrix of rank $r$ from merely $\Omega(n r^{3/2}\log(r))$ matrix entries. We also show that one can recover an order $T$ tensor using $\Omega(n r^{T-1/2}T^2 \log(r))$ entries. For noisy recovery, our algorithm consistently estimates a low rank matrix corrupted with noise using $\Omega(n r^{3/2} \textrm{polylog}(n))$ entries. We complement our study with simulations that verify our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms.	Low-Rank Matrix and Tensor Completion via Adaptive Sampling
0904.3523v3	We consider the empirical risk minimization problem for linear supervised learning, with regularization by structured sparsity-inducing norms. These are defined as sums of Euclidean norms on certain subsets of variables, extending the usual $\ell_1$-norm and the group $\ell_1$-norm by allowing the subsets to overlap. This leads to a specific set of allowed nonzero patterns for the solutions of such problems. We first explore the relationship between the groups defining the norm and the resulting nonzero patterns, providing both forward and backward algorithms to go back and forth from groups to patterns. This allows the design of norms adapted to specific prior knowledge expressed in terms of nonzero patterns. We also present an efficient active set algorithm, and analyze the consistency of variable selection for least-squares linear regression in low and high-dimensional settings.

1501.04080v2	Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for fine-tuning the hyper-parameters of a wide variety of machine learning models. The success of machine learning has led practitioners in diverse real-world settings to learn classifiers for practical problems. As machine learning becomes commonplace, Bayesian optimization becomes an attractive method for practitioners to automate the process of classifier hyper-parameter tuning. A key observation is that the data used for tuning models in these settings is often sensitive. Certain data such as genetic predisposition, personal email statistics, and car accident history, if not properly private, may be at risk of being inferred from Bayesian optimization outputs. To address this, we introduce methods for releasing the best hyper-parameters and classifier accuracy privately. Leveraging the strong theoretical guarantees of differential privacy and known Bayesian optimization convergence bounds, we prove that under a GP assumption these private quantities are also near-optimal. Finally, even if this assumption is not satisfied, we can use different smoothness guarantees to protect privacy.	Differentially Private Bayesian Optimization
1702.07608v1	Microwave-based breast cancer detection has been proposed as a complementary approach to compensate for some drawbacks of existing breast cancer detection techniques. Among the existing microwave breast cancer detection methods, machine learning-type algorithms have recently become more popular. These focus on detecting the existence of breast tumours rather than performing imaging to identify the exact tumour position. A key step of the machine learning approaches is feature extraction. One of the most widely used feature extraction method is principle component analysis (PCA). However, it can be sensitive to signal misalignment. This paper presents an empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based feature extraction method, which is more robust to the misalignment. Experimental results involving clinical data sets combined with numerically simulated tumour responses show that combined features from EMD and PCA improve the detection performance with an ensemble selection-based classifier.

1608.07526v1	The unscented transformation (UT) is an efficient method to solve the state estimation problem for a non-linear dynamic system, utilizing a derivative-free higher-order approximation by approximating a Gaussian distribution rather than approximating a non-linear function. Applying the UT to a Kalman filter type estimator leads to the well-known unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Although the UKF works very well in Gaussian noises, its performance may deteriorate significantly when the noises are non-Gaussian, especially when the system is disturbed by some heavy-tailed impulsive noises. To improve the robustness of the UKF against impulsive noises, a new filter for nonlinear systems is proposed in this work, namely the maximum correntropy unscented filter (MCUF). In MCUF, the UT is applied to obtain the prior estimates of the state and covariance matrix, and a robust statistical linearization regression based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is then used to obtain the posterior estimates of the state and covariance. The satisfying performance of the new algorithm is confirmed by two illustrative examples.	Maximum Correntropy Unscented Filter
1411.5271v2	Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is the only method we currently have to measure connections between different parts of the human brain in vivo. To elucidate the structure of these connections, algorithms for tracking bundles of axonal fibers through the subcortical white matter rely on local estimates of the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in different parts of the brain. These functions describe the relative abundance of populations of axonal fibers crossing each other in each location. Multiple models exist for estimating fODFs. The quality of the resulting estimates can be quantified by means of a suitable measure of distance on the space of fODFs. However, there are multiple distance metrics that can be applied for this purpose, including smoothed $L_p$ distances and the Wasserstein metrics. Here, we give four reasons for the use of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) equipped with the arc-length, as a distance metric.

1705.07606v2	Actor-critic methods solve reinforcement learning problems by updating a parameterized policy known as an actor in a direction that increases an estimate of the expected return known as a critic. However, existing actor-critic methods only use values or gradients of the critic to update the policy parameter. In this paper, we propose a novel actor-critic method called the guide actor-critic (GAC). GAC firstly learns a guide actor that locally maximizes the critic and then it updates the policy parameter based on the guide actor by supervised learning. Our main theoretical contributions are two folds. First, we show that GAC updates the guide actor by performing second-order optimization in the action space where the curvature matrix is based on the Hessians of the critic. Second, we show that the deterministic policy gradient method is a special case of GAC when the Hessians are ignored. Through experiments, we show that our method is a promising reinforcement learning method for continuous controls.	Guide Actor-Critic for Continuous Control
1507.02925v3	Many statistical methods for network data parameterize the edge-probability by attributing latent traits to the vertices such as block structure and assume exchangeability in the sense of the Aldous-Hoover representation theorem. Empirical studies of networks indicate that many real-world networks have a power-law distribution of the vertices which in turn implies the number of edges scale slower than quadratically in the number of vertices. These assumptions are fundamentally irreconcilable as the Aldous-Hoover theorem implies quadratic scaling of the number of edges. Recently Caron and Fox (2014) proposed the use of a different notion of exchangeability due to Kallenberg (2009) and obtained a network model which admits power-law behaviour while retaining desirable statistical properties, however this model does not capture latent vertex traits such as block-structure. In this work we re-introduce the use of block-structure for network models obeying Kallenberg's notion of exchangeability and thereby obtain a model which admits the inference of block-structure and edge inhomogeneity. We derive a simple expression for the likelihood and an efficient sampling method. The obtained model is not significantly more difficult to implement than existing approaches to block-modelling and performs well on real network datasets.	Completely random measures for modelling block-structured networks
1504.00624v5	We learn the structure of a Markov Network between two groups of random variables from joint observations. Since modelling and learning the full MN structure may be hard, learning the links between two groups directly may be a preferable option. We introduce a novel concept called the \emph{partitioned ratio} whose factorization directly associates with the Markovian properties of random variables across two groups. A simple one-shot convex optimization procedure is proposed for learning the \emph{sparse} factorizations of the partitioned ratio and it is theoretically guaranteed to recover the correct inter-group structure under mild conditions. The performance of the proposed method is experimentally compared with the state of the art MN structure learning methods using ROC curves. Real applications on analyzing bipartisanship in US congress and pairwise DNA/time-series alignments are also reported.	Structure Learning of Partitioned Markov Networks
1005.2263v2	We present a class of models that, via a simple construction, enables exact, incremental, non-parametric, polynomial-time, Bayesian inference of conditional measures. The approach relies upon creating a sequence of covers on the conditioning variable and maintaining a different model for each set within a cover. Inference remains tractable by specifying the probabilistic model in terms of a random walk within the sequence of covers. We demonstrate the approach on problems of conditional density estimation, which, to our knowledge is the first closed-form, non-parametric Bayesian approach to this problem.	Context models on sequences of covers
1302.3913v2	We present two graph-based algorithms for multiclass segmentation of high-dimensional data. The algorithms use a diffuse interface model based on the Ginzburg-Landau functional, related to total variation compressed sensing and image processing. A multiclass extension is introduced using the Gibbs simplex, with the functional's double-well potential modified to handle the multiclass case. The first algorithm minimizes the functional using a convex splitting numerical scheme. The second algorithm is a uses a graph adaptation of the classical numerical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, which alternates between diffusion and thresholding. We demonstrate the performance of both algorithms experimentally on synthetic data, grayscale and color images, and several benchmark data sets such as MNIST, COIL and WebKB. We also make use of fast numerical solvers for finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian, and take advantage of the sparsity of the matrix. Experiments indicate that the results are competitive with or better than the current state-of-the-art multiclass segmentation algorithms.

1306.3530v2	This paper generalizes beta divergence beyond its classical form associated with power variance functions of Tweedie models. Generalized form is represented by a compact definite integral as a function of variance function of the exponential dispersion model. This compact integral form simplifies derivations of many properties such as scaling, translation and expectation of the beta divergence. Further, we show that beta divergence and (half of) the statistical deviance are equivalent measures.	Generalized Beta Divergence
1301.3570v1	We develop a nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) for hierarchical topic modeling. The nHDP is a generalization of the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) that allows each word to follow its own path to a topic node according to a document-specific distribution on a shared tree. This alleviates the rigid, single-path formulation of the nCRP, allowing a document to more easily express thematic borrowings as a random effect. We demonstrate our algorithm on 1.8 million documents from The New York Times.	A Nested HDP for Hierarchical Topic Models
1510.06138v1	We propose a novel method for multiple clustering that assumes a co-clustering structure (partitions in both rows and columns of the data matrix) in each view. The new method is applicable to high-dimensional data. It is based on a nonparametric Bayesian approach in which the number of views and the number of feature-/subject clusters are inferred in a data-driven manner. We simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and multinomial distributions in each cluster block. This makes our method applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical variables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based on variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed method to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other multiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in computation time. Finally, we apply our method to a depression dataset with no true cluster structure available, from which useful inferences are drawn about possible clustering structures of the data.

1603.01140v1	We introduce overdispersed black-box variational inference, a method to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator of the gradient in black-box variational inference. Instead of taking samples from the variational distribution, we use importance sampling to take samples from an overdispersed distribution in the same exponential family as the variational approximation. Our approach is general since it can be readily applied to any exponential family distribution, which is the typical choice for the variational approximation. We run experiments on two non-conjugate probabilistic models to show that our method effectively reduces the variance, and the overhead introduced by the computation of the proposal parameters and the importance weights is negligible. We find that our overdispersed importance sampling scheme provides lower variance than black-box variational inference, even when the latter uses twice the number of samples.

1009.3890v1	Finding sparse solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations is a fundamental problem in signal processing and statistics which has become a subject of interest in recent years. In general, these systems have infinitely many solutions. However, it may be shown that sufficiently sparse solutions may be identified uniquely. In other words, the corresponding linear transformation will be invertible if we restrict its domain to sufficiently sparse vectors. This property may be used, for example, to solve the underdetermined Blind Source Separation (BSS) problem, or to find sparse representation of a signal in an `overcomplete' dictionary of primitive elements (i.e., the so-called atomic decomposition). The main drawback of current methods of finding sparse solutions is their computational complexity. In this paper, we will show that by detecting `active' components of the (potential) solution, i.e., those components having a considerable value, a framework for fast solution of the problem may be devised. The idea leads to a family of algorithms, called `Iterative Detection-Estimation (IDE)', which converge to the solution by successive detection and estimation of its active part. Comparing the performance of IDE(s) with one of the most successful method to date, which is based on Linear Programming (LP), an improvement in speed of about two to three orders of magnitude is observed.

1510.02830v1	In this paper we introduce a novel online time series forecasting model we refer to as the pM-GP filter. We show that our model is equivalent to Gaussian process regression, with the advantage that both online forecasting and online learning of the hyper-parameters have a constant (rather than cubic) time complexity and a constant (rather than squared) memory requirement in the number of observations, without resorting to approximations. Moreover, the proposed model is expressive in that the family of covariance functions of the implied latent process, namely the spectral Matern kernels, have recently been proven to be capable of approximating arbitrarily well any translation-invariant covariance function. The benefit of our approach compared to competing models is demonstrated using experiments on several real-life datasets.	p-Markov Gaussian Processes for Scalable and Expressive Online Bayesian  Nonparametric Time Series Forecasting
0805.1390v1	A simple and computationally efficient scheme for tree-structured vector quantization is presented. Unlike previous methods, its quantization error depends only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution, rather than the apparent dimension of the space in which the data happen to lie.

1406.2864v1	This paper presents novel algorithms which exploit the intrinsic algebraic and combinatorial structure of the matrix completion task for estimating missing en- tries in the general low rank setting.

1712.06206v1	We consider the problem of clustering with the longest leg path distance (LLPD) metric, which is informative for elongated and irregularly shaped clusters. We prove finite-sample guarantees on the performance of clustering with respect to this metric when random samples are drawn from multiple intrinsically low-dimensional clusters in high-dimensional space, in the presence of a large number of high-dimensional outliers. By combining these results with spectral clustering with respect to LLPD, we provide conditions under which the eigengap statistic correctly determines the number of clusters for a large class of data sets, and prove guarantees on the number of points mislabeled by the proposed algorithm. Our methods are quite general and provide performance guarantees for spectral clustering with any ultrametric. We also introduce an efficient approximation algorithm, easy to implement, for the LLPD, based on a multiscale analysis of adjacency graphs.

1510.05684v2	Early stopping is a well known approach to reduce the time complexity for performing training and model selection of large scale learning machines. On the other hand, memory/space (rather than time) complexity is the main constraint in many applications, and randomized subsampling techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. In this paper we ask whether early stopping and subsampling ideas can be combined in a fruitful way. We consider the question in a least squares regression setting and propose a form of randomized iterative regularization based on early stopping and subsampling. In this context, we analyze the statistical and computational properties of the proposed method. Theoretical results are complemented and validated by a thorough experimental analysis.

1502.03365v1	The labeled stochastic block model is a random graph model representing networks with community structure and interactions of multiple types. In its simplest form, it consists of two communities of approximately equal size, and the edges are drawn and labeled at random with probability depending on whether their two endpoints belong to the same community or not. It has been conjectured in \cite{Heimlicher12} that correlated reconstruction (i.e.\ identification of a partition correlated with the true partition into the underlying communities) would be feasible if and only if a model parameter exceeds a threshold. We prove one half of this conjecture, i.e., reconstruction is impossible when below the threshold. In the positive direction, we introduce a weighted graph to exploit the label information. With a suitable choice of weight function, we show that when above the threshold by a specific constant, reconstruction is achieved by (1) minimum bisection, (2) a semidefinite relaxation of minimum bisection, and (3) a spectral method combined with removal of edges incident to vertices of high degree. Furthermore, we show that hypothesis testing between the labeled stochastic block model and the labeled Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph model exhibits a phase transition at the conjectured reconstruction threshold.

1103.0431v2	We investigate the learning rate of multiple kernel leaning (MKL) with elastic-net regularization, which consists of an $\ell_1$-regularizer for inducing the sparsity and an $\ell_2$-regularizer for controlling the smoothness. We focus on a sparse setting where the total number of kernels is large but the number of non-zero components of the ground truth is relatively small, and prove that elastic-net MKL achieves the minimax learning rate on the $\ell_2$-mixed-norm ball. Our bound is sharper than the convergence rates ever shown, and has a property that the smoother the truth is, the faster the convergence rate is.

0903.0649v1	"Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula--or ""nonparanormal""--for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples."

1603.06340v1	If a document is about travel, we may expect that short snippets of the document should also be about travel. We introduce a general framework for incorporating these types of invariances into a discriminative classifier. The framework imagines data as being drawn from a slice of a Levy process. If we slice the Levy process at an earlier point in time, we obtain additional pseudo-examples, which can be used to train the classifier. We show that this scheme has two desirable properties: it preserves the Bayes decision boundary, and it is equivalent to fitting a generative model in the limit where we rewind time back to 0. Our construction captures popular schemes such as Gaussian feature noising and dropout training, as well as admitting new generalizations.	Data Augmentation via Levy Processes
1701.01064v2	Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of non-linear systems from experimental datasets. Recently, several attempts have extended DMD to the context of low-rank approximations. This extension is of particular interest for reduced-order modeling in various applicative domains, e.g. for climate prediction, to study molecular dynamics or micro-electromechanical devices. This low-rank extension takes the form of a non-convex optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, only sub-optimal algorithms have been proposed in the literature to compute the solution of this problem. In this paper, we prove that there exists a closed-form optimal solution to this problem and design an effective algorithm to compute it based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A toy-example illustrates the gain in performance of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art techniques.	Optimal Low-Rank Dynamic Mode Decomposition
1204.4243v1	In this paper we propose a novel framework for the construction of sparsity-inducing priors. In particular, we define such priors as a mixture of exponential power distributions with a generalized inverse Gaussian density (EP-GIG). EP-GIG is a variant of generalized hyperbolic distributions, and the special cases include Gaussian scale mixtures and Laplace scale mixtures. Furthermore, Laplace scale mixtures can subserve a Bayesian framework for sparse learning with nonconvex penalization. The densities of EP-GIG can be explicitly expressed. Moreover, the corresponding posterior distribution also follows a generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. These properties lead us to EM algorithms for Bayesian sparse learning. We show that these algorithms bear an interesting resemblance to iteratively re-weighted $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ methods. In addition, we present two extensions for grouped variable selection and logistic regression.	EP-GIG Priors and Applications in Bayesian Sparse Learning
1511.02187v3	We propose a framework to perform streaming covariance selection. Our approach employs regularization constraints where a time-varying sparsity parameter is iteratively estimated via stochastic gradient descent. This allows for the regularization parameter to be efficiently learnt in an online manner. The proposed framework is developed for linear regression models and extended to graphical models via neighbourhood selection. Under mild assumptions, we are able to obtain convergence results in a non-stochastic setting. The capabilities of such an approach are demonstrated using both synthetic data as well as neuroimaging data.	Streaming regularization parameter selection via stochastic gradient  descent
1705.09046v2	Exponential family distributions are highly useful in machine learning since their calculation can be performed efficiently through natural parameters. The exponential family has recently been extended to the t-exponential family, which contains Student-t distributions as family members and thus allows us to handle noisy data well. However, since the t-exponential family is denied by the deformed exponential, we cannot derive an efficient learning algorithm for the t-exponential family such as expectation propagation (EP). In this paper, we borrow the mathematical tools of q-algebra from statistical physics and show that the pseudo additivity of distributions allows us to perform calculation of t-exponential family distributions through natural parameters. We then develop an expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for the t-exponential family, which provides a deterministic approximation to the posterior or predictive distribution with simple moment matching. We finally apply the proposed EP algorithm to the Bayes point machine and Student-t process classication, and demonstrate their performance numerically.

1704.07554v2	The current work characterizes the users of a VoD streaming space through user-personas based on a tenure timeline and temporal behavioral features in the absence of explicit user profiles. A combination of tenure timeline and temporal characteristics caters to business needs of understanding the evolution and phases of user behavior as their accounts age. The personas constructed in this work successfully represent both dominant and niche characterizations while providing insightful maturation of user behavior in the system. The two major highlights of our personas are demonstration of stability along tenure timelines on a population level, while exhibiting interesting migrations between labels on an individual granularity and clear interpretability of user labels. Finally, we show a trade-off between an indispensable trio of guarantees, relevance-scalability-interpretability by using summary information from personas in a CTR (Click through rate) predictive model. The proposed method of uncovering latent personas, consequent insights from these and application of information from personas to predictive models are broadly applicable to other streaming based products.	A relevance-scalability-interpretability tradeoff with temporally  evolving user personas
1107.5959v2	"Many models of interest in the natural and social sciences have no closed-form likelihood function, which means that they cannot be treated using the usual techniques of statistical inference. In the case where such models can be efficiently simulated, Bayesian inference is still possible thanks to the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm. Although many refinements have been suggested, ABC inference is still far from routine. ABC is often excruciatingly slow due to very low acceptance rates. In addition, ABC requires introducing a vector of ""summary statistics"", the choice of which is relatively arbitrary, and often require some trial and error, making the whole process quite laborious for the user. We introduce in this work the EP-ABC algorithm, which is an adaptation to the likelihood-free context of the variational approximation algorithm known as Expectation Propagation (Minka, 2001). The main advantage of EP-ABC is that it is faster by a few orders of magnitude than standard algorithms, while producing an overall approximation error which is typically negligible. A second advantage of EP-ABC is that it replaces the usual global ABC constraint on the vector of summary statistics computed on the whole dataset, by n local constraints of the form that apply separately to each data-point. As a consequence, it is often possible to do away with summary statistics entirely. In that case, EP-ABC approximates directly the evidence (marginal likelihood) of the model. Comparisons are performed in three real-world applications which are typical of likelihood-free inference, including one application in neuroscience which is novel, and possibly too challenging for standard ABC techniques."	Expectation-Propagation for Likelihood-Free Inference
1606.00118v1	In genome-wide interaction studies, to detect gene-gene interactions, most methods are divided into two folds: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based and gene-based methods. Basically, the methods based on the gene are more effective than the methods based on a single SNP. Recent years, while the kernel canonical correlation analysis (Classical kernel CCA) based U statistic (KCCU) has proposed to detect the nonlinear relationship between genes. To estimate the variance in KCCU, they have used resampling based methods which are highly computationally intensive. In addition, classical kernel CCA is not robust to contaminated data. We, therefore, first discuss robust kernel mean element, the robust kernel covariance, and cross-covariance operators. Second, we propose a method based on influence function to estimate the variance of the KCCU. Third, we propose a nonparametric robust KCCU method based on robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. Finally, we investigate the proposed methods to synthesized data and imaging genetic data set. Based on gene ontology and pathway analysis, the synthesized and genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed robust method shows the superior performance of the state-of-the-art methods.

1711.01796v2	"Sparse regularization such as $\ell_1$ regularization is a quite powerful and widely used strategy for high dimensional learning problems. The effectiveness of sparse regularization has been supported practically and theoretically by several studies. However, one of the biggest issues in sparse regularization is that its performance is quite sensitive to correlations between features. Ordinary $\ell_1$ regularization can select variables correlated with each other, which results in deterioration of not only its generalization error but also interpretability. In this paper, we propose a new regularization method, ""Independently Interpretable Lasso"" (IILasso). Our proposed regularizer suppresses selecting correlated variables, and thus each active variable independently affects the objective variable in the model. Hence, we can interpret regression coefficients intuitively and also improve the performance by avoiding overfitting. We analyze theoretical property of IILasso and show that the proposed method is much advantageous for its sign recovery and achieves almost minimax optimal convergence rate. Synthetic and real data analyses also indicate the effectiveness of IILasso."	Independently Interpretable Lasso: A New Regularizer for Sparse  Regression with Uncorrelated Variables
1309.2303v1	Spectral clustering is sensitive to how graphs are constructed from data particularly when proximal and imbalanced clusters are present. We show that Ratio-Cut (RCut) or normalized cut (NCut) objectives are not tailored to imbalanced data since they tend to emphasize cut sizes over cut values. We propose a graph partitioning problem that seeks minimum cut partitions under minimum size constraints on partitions to deal with imbalanced data. Our approach parameterizes a family of graphs, by adaptively modulating node degrees on a fixed node set, to yield a set of parameter dependent cuts reflecting varying levels of imbalance. The solution to our problem is then obtained by optimizing over these parameters. We present rigorous limit cut analysis results to justify our approach. We demonstrate the superiority of our method through unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets.	Spectral Clustering with Imbalanced Data
1308.2029v3	Hierarchical probabilistic models, such as Gaussian mixture models, are widely used for unsupervised learning tasks. These models consist of observable and latent variables, which represent the observable data and the underlying data-generation process, respectively. Unsupervised learning tasks, such as cluster analysis, are regarded as estimations of latent variables based on the observable ones. The estimation of latent variables in semi-supervised learning, where some labels are observed, will be more precise than that in unsupervised, and one of the concerns is to clarify the effect of the labeled data. However, there has not been sufficient theoretical analysis of the accuracy of the estimation of latent variables. In a previous study, a distribution-based error function was formulated, and its asymptotic form was calculated for unsupervised learning with generative models. It has been shown that, for the estimation of latent variables, the Bayes method is more accurate than the maximum-likelihood method. The present paper reveals the asymptotic forms of the error function in Bayesian semi-supervised learning for both discriminative and generative models. The results show that the generative model, which uses all of the given data, performs better when the model is well specified.	Accuracy of Latent-Variable Estimation in Bayesian Semi-Supervised  Learning
1111.4259v1	In this paper, we propose a second order optimization method to learn models where both the dimensionality of the parameter space and the number of training samples is high. In our method, we construct on each iteration a Krylov subspace formed by the gradient and an approximation to the Hessian matrix, and then use a subset of the training data samples to optimize over this subspace. As with the Hessian Free (HF) method of [7], the Hessian matrix is never explicitly constructed, and is computed using a subset of data. In practice, as in HF, we typically use a positive definite substitute for the Hessian matrix such as the Gauss-Newton matrix. We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent and L-BFGS, and also to HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in cross-validation accuracy. It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it does not require a positive semi-definite approximation of the Hessian matrix to work well nor the setting of a damping parameter. The chief drawback versus HF is the need for memory to store a basis for the Krylov subspace.	Krylov Subspace Descent for Deep Learning
1109.5311v1	Bias - variance decomposition of the expected error defined for regression and classification problems is an important tool to study and compare different algorithms, to find the best areas for their application. Here the decomposition is introduced for the survival analysis problem. In our experiments, we study bias -variance parts of the expected error for two algorithms: original Cox proportional hazard regression and CoxPath, path algorithm for L1-regularized Cox regression, on the series of increased training sets. The experiments demonstrate that, contrary expectations, CoxPath does not necessarily have an advantage over Cox regression.	Bias Plus Variance Decomposition for Survival Analysis Problems
1801.10579v1	Telling cause from effect using observational data is a challenging problem, especially in the bivariate case. Contemporary methods often assume an independence between the cause and the generating mechanism of the effect given the cause. From this postulate, they derive asymmetries to uncover causal relationships. In this work, we propose such an approach, based on the link between Kolmogorov complexity and quantile scoring. We use a nonparametric conditional quantile estimator based on copulas to implement our procedure, thus avoiding restrictive assumptions about the joint distribution between cause and effect. In an extensive study on real and synthetic data, we show that quantile copula causal discovery (QCCD) compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods, while at the same time being computationally efficient and scalable.	Nonparametric Quantile-Based Causal Discovery
1204.3965v1	In this paper, we study statistical properties of semi-supervised learning, which is considered as an important problem in the community of machine learning. In the standard supervised learning, only the labeled data is observed. The classification and regression problems are formalized as the supervised learning. In semi-supervised learning, unlabeled data is also obtained in addition to labeled data. Hence, exploiting unlabeled data is important to improve the prediction accuracy in semi-supervised learning. This problems is regarded as a semiparametric estimation problem with missing data. Under the the discriminative probabilistic models, it had been considered that the unlabeled data is useless to improve the estimation accuracy. Recently, it was revealed that the weighted estimator using the unlabeled data achieves better prediction accuracy in comparison to the learning method using only labeled data, especially when the discriminative probabilistic model is misspecified. That is, the improvement under the semiparametric model with missing data is possible, when the semiparametric model is misspecified. In this paper, we apply the density-ratio estimator to obtain the weight function in the semi-supervised learning. The benefit of our approach is that the proposed estimator does not require well-specified probabilistic models for the probability of the unlabeled data. Based on the statistical asymptotic theory, we prove that the estimation accuracy of our method outperforms the supervised learning using only labeled data. Some numerical experiments present the usefulness of our methods.	Semi-Supervised learning with Density-Ratio Estimation
1105.3361v2	In data sets with many more features than observations, independent screening based on all univariate regression models leads to a computationally convenient variable selection method. Recent efforts have shown that in the case of generalized linear models, independent screening may suffice to capture all relevant features with high probability, even in ultra-high dimension. It is unclear whether this formal sure screening property is attainable when the response is a right-censored survival time. We propose a computationally very efficient independent screening method for survival data which can be viewed as the natural survival equivalent of correlation screening. We state conditions under which the method admits the sure screening property within a general class of single-index hazard rate models with ultra-high dimensional features. An iterative variant is also described which combines screening with penalized regression in order to handle more complex feature covariance structures. The methods are evaluated through simulation studies and through application to a real gene expression dataset.	Independent screening for single-index hazard rate models with  ultra-high dimensional features
1402.4501v3	A new non parametric approach to the problem of testing the independence of two random process is developed. The test statistic is the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which was used previously in testing independence for i.i.d pairs of variables. The asymptotic behaviour of HSIC is established when computed from samples drawn from random processes. It is shown that earlier bootstrap procedures which worked in the i.i.d. case will fail for random processes, and an alternative consistent estimate of the p-values is proposed. Tests on artificial data and real-world Forex data indicate that the new test procedure discovers dependence which is missed by linear approaches, while the earlier bootstrap procedure returns an elevated number of false positives. The code is available online: this https URL .	A Kernel Independence Test for Random Processes
1411.2540v2	This paper considers statistical estimation problems where the probability distribution of the observed random variable is invariant with respect to actions of a finite topological group. It is shown that any such distribution must satisfy a restricted finite mixture representation. When specialized to the case of distributions over the sphere that are invariant to the actions of a finite spherical symmetry group $\mathcal G$, a group-invariant extension of the Von Mises Fisher (VMF) distribution is obtained. The $\mathcal G$-invariant VMF is parameterized by location and scale parameters that specify the distribution's mean orientation and its concentration about the mean, respectively. Using the restricted finite mixture representation these parameters can be estimated using an Expectation Maximization (EM) maximum likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm. This is illustrated for the problem of mean crystal orientation estimation under the spherically symmetric group associated with the crystal form, e.g., cubic or octahedral or hexahedral. Simulations and experiments establish the advantages of the extended VMF EM-ML estimator for data acquired by Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) microscopy of a polycrystalline Nickel alloy sample.

1007.3098v3	Supervised linear feature extraction can be achieved by fitting a reduced rank multivariate model. This paper studies rank penalized and rank constrained vector generalized linear models. From the perspective of thresholding rules, we build a framework for fitting singular value penalized models and use it for feature extraction. Through solving the rank constraint form of the problem, we propose progressive feature space reduction for fast computation in high dimensions with little performance loss. A novel projective cross-validation is proposed for parameter tuning in such nonconvex setups. Real data applications are given to show the power of the methodology in supervised dimension reduction and feature extraction.	Reduced Rank Vector Generalized Linear Models for Feature Extraction
0909.5194v2	We propose Dirichlet Process mixtures of Generalized Linear Models (DP-GLM), a new method of nonparametric regression that accommodates continuous and categorical inputs, and responses that can be modeled by a generalized linear model. We prove conditions for the asymptotic unbiasedness of the DP-GLM regression mean function estimate. We also give examples for when those conditions hold, including models for compactly supported continuous distributions and a model with continuous covariates and categorical response. We empirically analyze the properties of the DP-GLM and why it provides better results than existing Dirichlet process mixture regression models. We evaluate DP-GLM on several data sets, comparing it to modern methods of nonparametric regression like CART, Bayesian trees and Gaussian processes. Compared to existing techniques, the DP-GLM provides a single model (and corresponding inference algorithms) that performs well in many regression settings.

1106.4251v1	We provide rigorous guarantees on learning with the weighted trace-norm under arbitrary sampling distributions. We show that the standard weighted trace-norm might fail when the sampling distribution is not a product distribution (i.e. when row and column indexes are not selected independently), present a corrected variant for which we establish strong learning guarantees, and demonstrate that it works better in practice. We provide guarantees when weighting by either the true or empirical sampling distribution, and suggest that even if the true distribution is known (or is uniform), weighting by the empirical distribution may be beneficial.

1410.6271v1	"We are focusing on bound constrained global optimization problems, whose objective functions are computationally expensive black-box functions and have multiple local minima. The recently popular Metric Stochastic Response Surface (MSRS) algorithm proposed by \cite{Regis2007SRBF} based on adaptive or sequential learning based on response surfaces is revisited and further extended for better performance in case of higher dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a new way to generate the candidate points which the next function evaluation point is picked from according to the metric criteria, based on a new definition of distance, and prove the global convergence of the corresponding. Correspondingly, a more adaptive implementation of MSRS, named ""SO-SA"", is presented. ""SO-SA"" is is more likely to perturb those most sensitive coordinates when generating the candidate points, instead of perturbing all coordinates simultaneously.

1104.1204v1	We describe a new variational lower-bound on the minimum energy configuration of a planar binary Markov Random Field (MRF). Our method is based on adding auxiliary nodes to every face of a planar embedding of the graph in order to capture the effect of unary potentials. A ground state of the resulting approximation can be computed efficiently by reduction to minimum-weight perfect matching. We show that optimization of variational parameters achieves the same lower-bound as dual-decomposition into the set of all cycles of the original graph. We demonstrate that our variational optimization converges quickly and provides high-quality solutions to hard combinatorial problems 10-100x faster than competing algorithms that optimize the same bound.

1103.4896v1	We consider the problem of classification when inputs correspond to sets of vectors. This setting occurs in many problems such as the classification of pieces of mail containing several pages, of web sites with several sections or of images that have been pre-segmented into smaller regions. We propose generalizations of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that are appropriate in this context and explore how to incorporate different assumptions about the relationship between the input sets and the target class within the RBM. In experiments on standard multiple-instance learning datasets, we demonstrate the competitiveness of approaches based on RBMs and apply the proposed variants to the problem of incoming mail classification.	Classification of Sets using Restricted Boltzmann Machines
1212.4569v2	Problems in machine learning (ML) can involve noisy input data, and ML classification methods have reached limiting accuracies when based on standard ML data sets consisting of feature vectors and their classes. Greater accuracy will require incorporation of prior structural information on data into learning. We study methods to regularize feature vectors (unsupervised regularization methods), analogous to supervised regularization for estimating functions in ML. We study regularization (denoising) of ML feature vectors using Tikhonov and other regularization methods for functions on ${\bf R}^n$. A feature vector ${\bf x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\{x_q\}_{q=1}^n$ is viewed as a function of its index $q$, and smoothed using prior information on its structure. This can involve a penalty functional on feature vectors analogous to those in statistical learning, or use of proximity (e.g. graph) structure on the set of indices. Such feature vector regularization inherits a property from function denoising on ${\bf R}^n$, in that accuracy is non-monotonic in the denoising (regularization) parameter $\alpha$. Under some assumptions about the noise level and the data structure, we show that the best reconstruction accuracy also occurs at a finite positive $\alpha$ in index spaces with graph structures. We adapt two standard function denoising methods used on ${\bf R}^n$, local averaging and kernel regression. In general the index space can be any discrete set with a notion of proximity, e.g. a metric space, a subset of ${\bf R}^n$, or a graph/network, with feature vectors as functions with some notion of continuity. We show this improves feature vector recovery, and thus the subsequent classification or regression done on them. We give an example in gene expression analysis for cancer classification with the genome as an index space and network structure based protein-protein interactions.

1312.1970v1	We present an exploration of the rich theoretical connections between several classes of regularized models, network flows, and recent results in submodular function theory. This work unifies key aspects of these problems under a common theory, leading to novel methods for working with several important models of interest in statistics, machine learning and computer vision. In Part 1, we review the concepts of network flows and submodular function optimization theory foundational to our results. We then examine the connections between network flows and the minimum-norm algorithm from submodular optimization, extending and improving several current results. This leads to a concise representation of the structure of a large class of pairwise regularized models important in machine learning, statistics and computer vision. In Part 2, we describe the full regularization path of a class of penalized regression problems with dependent variables that includes the graph-guided LASSO and total variation constrained models. This description also motivates a practical algorithm. This allows us to efficiently find the regularization path of the discretized version of TV penalized models. Ultimately, our new algorithms scale up to high-dimensional problems with millions of variables.	An Algorithmic Theory of Dependent Regularizers, Part 1: Submodular  Structure
1012.3584v1	We propose a novel algorithm to solve the expectation propagation relaxation of Bayesian inference for continuous-variable graphical models. In contrast to most previous algorithms, our method is provably convergent. By marrying convergent EP ideas from (Opper&Winther 05) with covariance decoupling techniques (Wipf&Nagarajan 08, Nickisch&Seeger 09), it runs at least an order of magnitude faster than the most commonly used EP solver.

1312.4710v1	Real world systems typically feature a variety of different dependency types and topologies that complicate model selection for probabilistic graphical models. We introduce the ensemble-of-forests model, a generalization of the ensemble-of-trees model. Our model enables structure learning of Markov random fields (MRF) with multiple connected components and arbitrary potentials. We present two approximate inference techniques for this model and demonstrate their performance on synthetic data. Our results suggest that the ensemble-of-forests approach can accurately recover sparse, possibly disconnected MRF topologies, even in presence of non-Gaussian dependencies and/or low sample size. We applied the ensemble-of-forests model to learn the structure of perturbed signaling networks of immune cells and found that these frequently exhibit non-Gaussian dependencies with disconnected MRF topologies. In summary, we expect that the ensemble-of-forests model will enable MRF structure learning in other high dimensional real world settings that are governed by non-trivial dependencies.

1003.0078v1	Security issues are crucial in a number of machine learning applications, especially in scenarios dealing with human activity rather than natural phenomena (e.g., information ranking, spam detection, malware detection, etc.). It is to be expected in such cases that learning algorithms will have to deal with manipulated data aimed at hampering decision making. Although some previous work addressed the handling of malicious data in the context of supervised learning, very little is known about the behavior of anomaly detection methods in such scenarios. In this contribution we analyze the performance of a particular method -- online centroid anomaly detection -- in the presence of adversarial noise. Our analysis addresses the following security-related issues: formalization of learning and attack processes, derivation of an optimal attack, analysis of its efficiency and constraints. We derive bounds on the effectiveness of a poisoning attack against centroid anomaly under different conditions: bounded and unbounded percentage of traffic, and bounded false positive rate. Our bounds show that whereas a poisoning attack can be effectively staged in the unconstrained case, it can be made arbitrarily difficult (a strict upper bound on the attacker's gain) if external constraints are properly used. Our experimental evaluation carried out on real HTTP and exploit traces confirms the tightness of our theoretical bounds and practicality of our protection mechanisms.

1302.2969v1	Measurements made by satellite remote sensing, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and globally distributed Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) are compared. Comparison of the two datasets measurements for aerosol optical depth values show that there are biases between the two data products. In this paper, we present a general framework towards identifying relevant set of variables responsible for the observed bias. We present a general framework to identify the possible factors influencing the bias, which might be associated with the measurement conditions such as the solar and sensor zenith angles, the solar and sensor azimuth, scattering angles, and surface reflectivity at the various measured wavelengths, etc. Specifically, we performed analysis for remote sensing Aqua-Land data set, and used machine learning technique, neural network in this case, to perform multivariate regression between the ground-truth and the training data sets. Finally, we used mutual information between the observed and the predicted values as the measure of similarity to identify the most relevant set of variables. The search is brute force method as we have to consider all possible combinations. The computations involves a huge number crunching exercise, and we implemented it by writing a job-parallel program.

1503.02424v2	Standard sparse pseudo-input approximations to the Gaussian process (GP) cannot handle complex functions well. Sparse spectrum alternatives attempt to answer this but are known to over-fit. We suggest the use of variational inference for the sparse spectrum approximation to avoid both issues. We model the covariance function with a finite Fourier series approximation and treat it as a random variable. The random covariance function has a posterior, on which a variational distribution is placed. The variational distribution transforms the random covariance function to fit the data. We study the properties of our approximate inference, compare it to alternative ones, and extend it to the distributed and stochastic domains. Our approximation captures complex functions better than standard approaches and avoids over-fitting.

0908.2359v2	"Online (also called ""recursive"" or ""adaptive"") estimation of fixed model parameters in hidden Markov models is a topic of much interest in times series modelling. In this work, we propose an online parameter estimation algorithm that combines two key ideas. The first one, which is deeply rooted in the Expectation-Maximization (EM) methodology consists in reparameterizing the problem using complete-data sufficient statistics. The second ingredient consists in exploiting a purely recursive form of smoothing in HMMs based on an auxiliary recursion. Although the proposed online EM algorithm resembles a classical stochastic approximation (or Robbins-Monro) algorithm, it is sufficiently different to resist conventional analysis of convergence. We thus provide limited results which identify the potential limiting points of the recursion as well as the large-sample behavior of the quantities involved in the algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is numerically evaluated through simulations in the case of a noisily observed Markov chain. In this case, the algorithm reaches estimation results that are comparable to that of the maximum likelihood estimator for large sample sizes."	Online EM Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models
1103.3095v1	We show that the disagreement coefficient of certain smooth hypothesis classes is $O(m)$, where $m$ is the dimension of the hypothesis space, thereby answering a question posed in \cite{friedman09}.	A note on active learning for smooth problems
1008.5386v1	Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular framework to express multivariate probability distributions. Acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) are generalizations of DAGs that can succinctly capture much richer sets of conditional independencies, and are especially useful in modeling the effects of latent variables implicitly. Unfortunately there are currently no good parameterizations of general ADMGs. In this paper, we apply recent work on cumulative distribution networks and copulas to propose one one general construction for ADMG models. We consider a simple parameter estimation approach, and report some encouraging experimental results.	Mixed Cumulative Distribution Networks
1702.06278v1	In this note we answer a question of G. Lecu\'{e}, by showing that column normalization of a random matrix with iid entries need not lead to good sparse recovery properties, even if the generating random variable has a reasonable moment growth. Specifically, for every $2 \leq p \leq c_1\log d$ we construct a random vector $X \in R^d$ with iid, mean-zero, variance $1$ coordinates, that satisfies $\sup_{t \in S^{d-1}} \|<X,t>\|_{L_q} \leq c_2\sqrt{q}$ for every $2\leq q \leq p$. We show that if $m \leq c_3\sqrt{p}d^{1/p}$ and $\tilde{\Gamma}:R^d \to R^m$ is the column-normalized matrix generated by $m$ independent copies of $X$, then with probability at least $1-2\exp(-c_4m)$, $\tilde{\Gamma}$ does not satisfy the exact reconstruction property of order $2$.

1707.09724v1	Transfer learning aims to improve learning in the target domain with limited training data by borrowing knowledge from a related but different source domain with sufficient labeled data. To reduce the distribution shift between source and target domains, recent methods have focused on exploring invariant representations that have similar distributions across domains. However, existing methods assume that the labels in the source domain are uncontaminated, while in reality, we often only have access to a source domain with noisy labels. In this paper, we first analyze the effects of label noise in various transfer learning scenarios in which the data distribution is assumed to change in different ways. We find that although label noise has no effect on the invariant representation learning in the covariate shift scenario, it has adverse effects on the learning process in the more general target/conditional shift scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose a new transfer learning method to learn invariant representations in the presence of label noise, which also simultaneously estimates the label distributions in the target domain. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Transfer Learning with Label Noise
0902.3347v1	The runtime for Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to compute the fit is quadratic in the number of examples. However, the necessity of obtaining sensitivity measures as degrees of freedom for model selection or confidence intervals for more detailed analysis requires cubic runtime, and thus constitutes a computational bottleneck in real-world data analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for KPLS which not only computes (a) the fit, but also (b) its approximate degrees of freedom and (c) error bars in quadratic runtime. The algorithm exploits a close connection between Kernel PLS and the Lanczos algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, and uses this approximation to compute the trace of powers of the kernel matrix in quadratic runtime.

1512.05610v2	We propose a novel classification model for weak signal data, building upon a recent model for Bayesian multi-view learning, Group Factor Analysis (GFA). Instead of assuming all data to come from a single GFA model, we allow latent clusters, each having a different GFA model and producing a different class distribution. We show that sharing information across the clusters, by sharing factors, increases the classification accuracy considerably; the shared factors essentially form a flexible noise model that explains away the part of data not related to classification. Motivation for the setting comes from single-trial functional brain imaging data, having a very low signal-to-noise ratio and a natural multi-view setting, with the different sensors, measurement modalities (EEG, MEG, fMRI) and possible auxiliary information as views. We demonstrate our model on a MEG dataset.	Classification of weak multi-view signals by sharing factors in a  mixture of Bayesian group factor analyzers
1104.0455v1	Nonparametric methods are widely applicable to statistical inference problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric regression against outliers - that is, data markedly deviating from the postulated models. A variational counterpart to least-trimmed squares regression is shown closely related to an L0-(pseudo)norm-regularized estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector explicitly modeling the outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers based on convex relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type estimator equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier vector along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced bias and enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of an improved estimator obtained after replacing the L0-(pseudo)norm with a nonconvex surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is adopted to cleanse load curve data, a key task aiding operational decisions in the envisioned smart grid system. Computer simulations and tests on real load curve data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel sparsity-controlling robust estimators.

1504.02800v1	Brain decoding involves the determination of a subject's cognitive state or an associated stimulus from functional neuroimaging data measuring brain activity. In this setting the cognitive state is typically characterized by an element of a finite set, and the neuroimaging data comprise voluminous amounts of spatiotemporal data measuring some aspect of the neural signal. The associated statistical problem is one of classification from high-dimensional data. We explore the use of functional principal component analysis, mutual information networks, and persistent homology for examining the data through exploratory analysis and for constructing features characterizing the neural signal for brain decoding. We review each approach from this perspective, and we incorporate the features into a classifier based on symmetric multinomial logistic regression with elastic net regularization. The approaches are illustrated in an application where the task is to infer, from brain activity measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG), the type of video stimulus shown to a subject.

1205.3193v1	Collaborative filtering is a rapidly advancing research area. Every year several new techniques are proposed and yet it is not clear which of the techniques work best and under what conditions. In this paper we conduct a study comparing several collaborative filtering techniques -- both classic and recent state-of-the-art -- in a variety of experimental contexts. Specifically, we report conclusions controlling for number of items, number of users, sparsity level, performance criteria, and computational complexity. Our conclusions identify what algorithms work well and in what conditions, and contribute to both industrial deployment collaborative filtering algorithms and to the research community.

1704.05193v2	We consider the problem of accelerating distributed optimization in multi-agent networks by sequentially adding edges. Specifically, we extend the distributed dual averaging (DDA) subgradient algorithm to evolving networks of growing connectivity and analyze the corresponding improvement in convergence rate. It is known that the convergence rate of DDA is influenced by the algebraic connectivity of the underlying network, where better connectivity leads to faster convergence. However, the impact of network topology design on the convergence rate of DDA has not been fully understood. In this paper, we begin by designing network topologies via edge selection and scheduling. For edge selection, we determine the best set of candidate edges that achieves the optimal tradeoff between the growth of network connectivity and the usage of network resources. The dynamics of network evolution is then incurred by edge scheduling. Further, we provide a tractable approach to analyze the improvement in the convergence rate of DDA induced by the growth of network connectivity. Our analysis reveals the connection between network topology design and the convergence rate of DDA, and provides quantitative evaluation of DDA acceleration for distributed optimization that is absent in the existing analysis. Lastly, numerical experiments show that DDA can be significantly accelerated using a sequence of well-designed networks, and our theoretical predictions are well matched to its empirical convergence behavior.

1712.02311v1	A variety of machine learning tasks---e.g., matrix factorization, topic modelling, and feature allocation---can be viewed as learning the parameters of a probability distribution over bipartite graphs. Recently, a new class of models for networks, the sparse exchangeable graphs, have been introduced to resolve some important pathologies of traditional approaches to statistical network modelling; most notably, the inability to model sparsity (in the asymptotic sense). The present paper explains some practical insights arising from this work. We first show how to check if sparsity is relevant for modelling a given (fixed size) dataset by using network subsampling to identify a simple signature of sparsity. We discuss the implications of the (sparse) exchangeable subsampling theory for test-train dataset splitting; we argue common approaches can lead to biased results, and we propose a principled alternative. Finally, we study sparse exchangeable Poisson matrix factorization as a worked example. In particular, we show how to adapt mean field variational inference to the sparse exchangeable setting, allowing us to scale inference to huge datasets.

1709.06171v2	This paper investigates the theoretical foundations of metric learning, focused on three key questions that are not fully addressed in prior work: 1) we consider learning general low-dimensional (low-rank) metrics as well as sparse metrics; 2) we develop upper and lower (minimax)bounds on the generalization error; 3) we quantify the sample complexity of metric learning in terms of the dimension of the feature space and the dimension/rank of the underlying metric;4) we also bound the accuracy of the learned metric relative to the underlying true generative metric. All the results involve novel mathematical approaches to the metric learning problem, and lso shed new light on the special case of ordinal embedding (aka non-metric multidimensional scaling).

1412.4098v4	Matching datasets of multiple modalities has become an important task in data analysis. Existing methods often rely on the embedding and transformation of each single modality without utilizing any correspondence information, which often results in sub-optimal matching performance. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear manifold matching algorithm using shortest-path distance and joint neighborhood selection. Specifically, a joint nearest-neighbor graph is built for all modalities. Then the shortest-path distance within each modality is calculated from the joint neighborhood graph, followed by embedding into and matching in a common low-dimensional Euclidean space. Compared to existing algorithms, our approach exhibits superior performance for matching disparate datasets of multiple modalities.	Manifold Matching using Shortest-Path Distance and Joint Neighborhood  Selection
1710.00210v2	Feature selection with high-dimensional data and a very small proportion of relevant features poses a severe challenge to standard statistical methods. We have developed a new approach (HARVEST) that is straightforward to apply, albeit somewhat computer-intensive. This algorithm can be used to pre-screen a large number of features to identify those that are potentially useful. The basic idea is to evaluate each feature in the context of many random subsets of other features. HARVEST is predicated on the assumption that an irrelevant feature can add no real predictive value, regardless of which other features are included in the subset. Motivated by this idea, we have derived a simple statistical test for feature relevance. Empirical analyses and simulations produced so far indicate that the HARVEST algorithm is highly effective in predictive analytics, both in science and business.

1212.6936v1	This technical note considers the problems of blind sparse learning and inference of electrogram (EGM) signals under atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions. First of all we introduce a mathematical model for the observed signals that takes into account the multiple foci typically appearing inside the heart during AF. Then we propose a reconstruction model based on a fixed dictionary and discuss several alternatives for choosing the dictionary. In order to obtain a sparse solution that takes into account the biological restrictions of the problem, a first alternative is using LASSO regularization followed by a post-processing stage that removes low amplitude coefficients violating the refractory period characteristic of cardiac cells. As an alternative we propose a novel regularization term, called cross products LASSO (CP-LASSO), that is able to incorporate the biological constraints directly into the optimization problem. Unfortunately, the resulting problem is non-convex, but we show how it can be solved efficiently in an approximated way making use of successive convex approximations (SCA). Finally, spectral analysis is performed on the clean activation sequence obtained from the sparse learning stage in order to estimate the number of latent foci and their frequencies. Simulations on synthetic and real data are provided to validate the proposed approach.	Blind Analysis of EGM Signals: Sparsity-Aware Formulation
1712.00535v2	"We introduce a new approach for topic modeling that is supervised by survival analysis. Specifically, we build on recent work on unsupervised topic modeling with so-called anchor words by providing supervision through an elastic-net regularized Cox proportional hazards model. In short, an anchor word being present in a document provides strong indication that the document is partially about a specific topic. For example, by seeing ""gallstones"" in a document, we are fairly certain that the document is partially about medicine. Our proposed method alternates between learning a topic model and learning a survival model to find a local minimum of a block convex optimization problem. We apply our proposed approach to predicting how long patients with pancreatitis admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) will stay in the ICU. Our approach is as accurate as the best of a variety of baselines while being more interpretable than any of the baselines."

1109.0258v2	Within the unmanageably large class of nonconvex optimization, we consider the rich subclass of nonsmooth problems that have composite objectives---this already includes the extensively studied convex, composite objective problems as a special case. For this subclass, we introduce a powerful, new framework that permits asymptotically non-vanishing perturbations. In particular, we develop perturbation-based batch and incremental (online like) nonconvex proximal splitting algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such perturbation-based nonconvex splitting algorithms are being proposed and analyzed. While the main contribution of the paper is the theoretical framework, we complement our results by presenting some empirical results on matrix factorization.

1710.01931v1	Understanding player behavior is fundamental in game data science. Video games evolve as players interact with the game, so being able to foresee player experience would help to ensure a successful game development. In particular, game developers need to evaluate beforehand the impact of in-game events. Simulation optimization of these events is crucial to increase player engagement and maximize monetization. We present an experimental analysis of several methods to forecast game-related variables, with two main aims: to obtain accurate predictions of in-app purchases and playtime in an operational production environment, and to perform simulations of in-game events in order to maximize sales and playtime. Our ultimate purpose is to take a step towards the data-driven development of games. The results suggest that, even though the performance of traditional approaches such as ARIMA is still better, the outcomes of state-of-the-art techniques like deep learning are promising. Deep learning comes up as a well-suited general model that could be used to forecast a variety of time series with different dynamic behaviors.

1802.04960v1	"Suppose that one particular block in a stochastic block model is deemed ""interesting,"" but block labels are only observed for a few of the vertices. Utilizing a graph realized from the model, the vertex nomination task is to order the vertices with unobserved block labels into a ""nomination list"" with the goal of having an abundance of interesting vertices near the top of the list. In this paper we extend and enhance two basic vertex nomination schemes; the canonical nomination scheme ${\mathcal L}^C$ and the spectral partitioning nomination scheme ${\mathcal L}^P$. The canonical nomination scheme ${\mathcal L}^C$ is provably optimal, but is computationally intractable, being impractical to implement even on modestly sized graphs. With this in mind, we introduce a scalable, Markov chain Monte Carlo-based nomination scheme, called the {\it canonical sampling nomination scheme} ${\mathcal L}^{CS}$, that converges to the canonical nomination scheme ${\mathcal L}^{C}$ as the amount of sampling goes to infinity. We also introduce a novel spectral partitioning nomination scheme called the {\it extended spectral partitioning nomination scheme} ${\mathcal L}^{EP}$. Real-data and simulation experiments are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of these vertex nomination schemes, as well as their empirical computational complexity."

1611.05940v2	We propose a method for finding alternate features missing in the Lasso optimal solution. In ordinary Lasso problem, one global optimum is obtained and the resulting features are interpreted as task-relevant features. However, this can overlook possibly relevant features not selected by the Lasso. With the proposed method, we can provide not only the Lasso optimal solution but also possible alternate features to the Lasso solution. We show that such alternate features can be computed efficiently by avoiding redundant computations. We also demonstrate how the proposed method works in the 20 newsgroup data, which shows that reasonable features are found as alternate features.	Finding Alternate Features in Lasso
1007.4062v1	Support vector machines (SVMs) are special kernel based methods and belong to the most successful learning methods since more than a decade. SVMs can informally be described as a kind of regularized M-estimators for functions and have demonstrated their usefulness in many complicated real-life problems. During the last years a great part of the statistical research on SVMs has concentrated on the question how to design SVMs such that they are universally consistent and statistically robust for nonparametric classification or nonparametric regression purposes. In many applications, some qualitative prior knowledge of the distribution P or of the unknown function f to be estimated is present or the prediction function with a good interpretability is desired, such that a semiparametric model or an additive model is of interest. In this paper we mainly address the question how to design SVMs by choosing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) or its corresponding kernel to obtain consistent and statistically robust estimators in additive models. We give an explicit construction of kernels - and thus of their RKHSs - which leads in combination with a Lipschitz continuous loss function to consistent and statistically robust SMVs for additive models. Examples are quantile regression based on the pinball loss function, regression based on the epsilon-insensitive loss function, and classification based on the hinge loss function.

1705.07832v1	Dropout is used as a practical tool to obtain uncertainty estimates in large vision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, a grid-search over the dropout probabilities is necessary - a prohibitive operation with large models, and an impossible one with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved performance and better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments in Bayesian deep learning, we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete masks. Together with a principled optimisation objective, this allows for automatic tuning of the dropout probability in large models, and as a result faster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as more data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant extensively on a range of tasks, and give insights into common practice in the field where larger dropout probabilities are often used in deeper model layers.	Concrete Dropout
1703.09528v2	Analyzing time series data is important to predict future events and changes in finance, manufacturing, and administrative decisions. Gaussian processes (GPs) solve regression and classification problems by choosing appropriate kernels capturing covariance structure of data. In time series analysis, GP based regression methods recently demonstrate competitive performance by decomposing temporal covariance structure. Such covariance structure decomposition allows exploiting shared parameters over a set of multiple but selected time series. In this paper, we handle multiple time series by placing an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior on the presence of shared kernels. We investigate the validity of model when infinite latent components are introduced. We also propose an improved search algorithm to find interpretable kernels among multiple time series along with comparison reports. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic data sets and real world data sets, showing promising results in term of structure discoveries and predictive performances.

1601.04674v2	For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual's disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual's disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions--the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy.

1802.04676v1	We consider multi-task learning, which simultaneously learns related prediction tasks, to improve generalization performance. We factorize a coefficient matrix as the product of two matrices based on a low-rank assumption. These matrices have sparsities to simultaneously perform variable selection and learn and overlapping group structure among the tasks. The resulting bi-convex objective function is minimized by alternating optimization where sub-problems are solved using alternating direction method of multipliers and accelerated proximal gradient descent. Moreover, we provide the performance bound of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated for both synthetic and real-world datasets.

1411.5799v2	Factor analysis provides linear factors that describe relationships between individual variables of a data set. We extend this classical formulation into linear factors that describe relationships between groups of variables, where each group represents either a set of related variables or a data set. The model also naturally extends canonical correlation analysis to more than two sets, in a way that is more flexible than previous extensions. Our solution is formulated as variational inference of a latent variable model with structural sparsity, and it consists of two hierarchical levels: The higher level models the relationships between the groups, whereas the lower models the observed variables given the higher level. We show that the resulting solution solves the group factor analysis problem accurately, outperforming alternative factor analysis based solutions as well as more straightforward implementations of group factor analysis. The method is demonstrated on two life science data sets, one on brain activation and the other on systems biology, illustrating its applicability to the analysis of different types of high-dimensional data sources.

0804.1325v1	When using the K-nearest neighbors method, one often ignores uncertainty in the choice of K. To account for such uncertainty, Holmes and Adams (2002) proposed a Bayesian framework for K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Their Bayesian KNN (BKNN) approach uses a pseudo-likelihood function, and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to draw posterior samples. Holmes and Adams (2002) focused on the performance of BKNN in terms of misclassification error but did not assess its ability to quantify uncertainty. We present some evidence to show that BKNN still significantly underestimates model uncertainty.	On the underestimation of model uncertainty by Bayesian K-nearest  neighbors
1703.08085v3	Inferring the correct answers to binary tasks based on multiple noisy answers in an unsupervised manner has emerged as the canonical question for micro-task crowdsourcing or more generally aggregating opinions. In graphon estimation, one is interested in estimating edge intensities or probabilities between nodes using a single snapshot of a graph realization. In the recent literature, there has been exciting development within both of these topics. In the context of crowdsourcing, the key intellectual challenge is to understand whether a given task can be more accurately denoised by aggregating answers collected from other different tasks. In the context of graphon estimation, precise information limits and estimation algorithms remain of interest. In this paper, we utilize a statistical reduction from crowdsourcing to graphon estimation to advance the state-of-art for both of these challenges. We use concepts from graphon estimation to design an algorithm that achieves better performance than the {\em majority voting} scheme for a setup that goes beyond the {\em rank one} models considered in the literature. We use known explicit lower bounds for crowdsourcing to provide refined lower bounds for graphon estimation.	Reducing Crowdsourcing to Graphon Estimation, Statistically
1112.1556v3	We derive and analyze a new, efficient, pool-based active learning algorithm for halfspaces, called ALuMA. Most previous algorithms show exponential improvement in the label complexity assuming that the distribution over the instance space is close to uniform. This assumption rarely holds in practical applications. Instead, we study the label complexity under a large-margin assumption -- a much more realistic condition, as evident by the success of margin-based algorithms such as SVM. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and comes with formal guarantees on its label complexity. It also naturally extends to the non-separable case and to non-linear kernels. Experiments illustrate the clear advantage of ALuMA over other active learning algorithms.	Active Learning of Halfspaces under a Margin Assumption
1701.07926v3	Consider a left-truncated right-censored survival process whose evolution depends on time-varying covariates. Given functional data samples from the process, we propose a practical boosting procedure for estimating its log-intensity function. Our method does not require any separability assumptions like Cox proportional- or Aalen additive-hazards, thus it can flexibly capture time-covariate interactions. The estimator is consistent if the model is correctly specified; alternatively an oracle inequality can be demonstrated for tree-based models. We use the procedure to shed new light on a question from the operations literature concerning the effect of workload on service rates in an emergency department.

1202.1121v2	In this paper I present an extended implementation of the Random ferns algorithm contained in the R package rFerns. It differs from the original by the ability of consuming categorical and numerical attributes instead of only binary ones. Also, instead of using simple attribute subspace ensemble it employs bagging and thus produce error approximation and variable importance measure modelled after Random forest algorithm. I also present benchmarks' results which show that although Random ferns' accuracy is mostly smaller than achieved by Random forest, its speed and good quality of importance measure it provides make rFerns a reasonable choice for a specific applications.	rFerns: An Implementation of the Random Ferns Method for General-Purpose  Machine Learning
1705.10934v4	Recent papers have formulated the problem of learning graphs from data as an inverse covariance estimation with graph Laplacian constraints. While such problems are convex, existing methods cannot guarantee that solutions will have specific graph topology properties (e.g., being $k$-partite), which are desirable for some applications. In fact, the problem of learning a graph with given topology properties, e.g., finding the $k$-partite graph that best matches the data, is in general non-convex. In this paper, we develop novel theoretical results that provide performance guarantees for an approach to solve these problems. Our solution decomposes this problem into two sub-problems, for which efficient solutions are known. Specifically, a graph topology inference (GTI) step is employed to select a feasible graph topology, i.e., one having the desired property. Then, a graph weight estimation (GWE) step is performed by solving a generalized graph Laplacian estimation problem, where edges are constrained by the topology found in the GTI step. Our main result is a bound on the error of the GWE step as a function of the error in the GTI step. This error bound indicates that the GTI step should be solved using an algorithm that approximates the similarity matrix by another matrix whose entries have been thresholded to zero to have the desired type of graph topology. The GTI stage can leverage existing methods (e.g., state of the art approaches for graph coloring) which are typically based on minimizing the total weight of removed edges. Since the GWE stage is formulated as an inverse covariance estimation problem with linear constraints, it can be solved using existing convex optimization methods. We demonstrate that our two step approach can achieve good results for both synthetic and texture image data.	Learning Graphs with Monotone Topology Properties and Multiple Connected  Components
1604.01602v2	Research on manifold learning within a density ridge estimation framework has shown great potential in recent work for both estimation and de-noising of manifolds, building on the intuitive and well-defined notion of principal curves and surfaces. However, the problem of unwrapping or unfolding manifolds has received relatively little attention within the density ridge approach, despite being an integral part of manifold learning in general. This paper proposes two novel algorithms for unwrapping manifolds based on estimated principal curves and surfaces for one- and multi-dimensional manifolds respectively. The methods of unwrapping are founded in the realization that both principal curves and principal surfaces will have inherent local maxima of the probability density function. Following this observation, coordinate systems that follow the shape of the manifold can be computed by following the integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate on the manifold. Furthermore, since integral curves of the gradient flow of a kernel density estimate is inherently local, we propose to stitch together local coordinate systems using parallel transport along the manifold. We provide numerical experiments on both real and synthetic data that illustrates clear and intuitive unwrapping results comparable to state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms.	Manifold unwrapping using density ridges
0909.5422v1	In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi--supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step. Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach.	Laplacian Support Vector Machines Trained in the Primal
1203.3468v1	Hierarchical structure is ubiquitous in data across many domains. There are many hierarchical clustering methods, frequently used by domain experts, which strive to discover this structure. However, most of these methods limit discoverable hierarchies to those with binary branching structure. This limitation, while computationally convenient, is often undesirable. In this paper we explore a Bayesian hierarchical clustering algorithm that can produce trees with arbitrary branching structure at each node, known as rose trees. We interpret these trees as mixtures over partitions of a data set, and use a computationally efficient, greedy agglomerative algorithm to find the rose trees which have high marginal likelihood given the data. Lastly, we perform experiments which demonstrate that rose trees are better models of data than the typical binary trees returned by other hierarchical clustering algorithms.	Bayesian Rose Trees
1611.04790v1	The ability to track a moving vehicle is of crucial importance in numerous applications. The task has often been approached by the importance sampling technique of particle filters due to its ability to model non-linear and non-Gaussian dynamics, of which a vehicle travelling on a road network is a good example. Particle filters perform poorly when observations are highly informative. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing particle filters that sample around the most recent observation. The proposal leads to an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy and efficiency over conventional particle filters, especially when observations are infrequent but low-noise.	Improved Particle Filters for Vehicle Localisation
1703.04455v5	Gaussian process for vector-valued function model has been shown to be a useful method for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to re-formulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, re-formulation is not always workable and difficult to extend because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to related multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student$-t$ distribution. In this paper, we propose a new derivation of multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR), where the model settings, derivations and computations are all directly performed in matrix form, rather than vectorizing the matrices as done in the existing methods. Furthermore, we introduce the multivariate Student$-t$ process and then derive a new method, multivariate Student$-t$ process regression (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets.	Multivariate Gaussian and Student$-t$ Process Regression for  Multi-output Prediction
0901.0026v1	There has been an explosion of interest in statistical models for analyzing network data, and considerable interest in the class of exponential random graph (ERG) models, especially in connection with difficulties in computing maximum likelihood estimates. The issues associated with these difficulties relate to the broader structure of discrete exponential families. This paper re-examines the issues in two parts. First we consider the closure of $k$-dimensional exponential families of distribution with discrete base measure and polyhedral convex support $\mathrm{P}$. We show that the normal fan of $\mathrm{P}$ is a geometric object that plays a fundamental role in deriving the statistical and geometric properties of the corresponding extended exponential families. We discuss its relevance to maximum likelihood estimation, both from a theoretical and computational standpoint. Second, we apply our results to the analysis of ERG models. In particular, by means of a detailed example, we provide some characterization of the properties of ERG models, and, in particular, of certain behaviors of ERG models known as degeneracy.

1203.3495v1	Due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, learning with unlabeled data is attracting increasing attention in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised kernel learning method which can seamlessly combine manifold structure of unlabeled data and Regularized Least-Squares (RLS) to learn a new kernel. Interestingly, the new kernel matrix can be obtained analytically with the use of spectral decomposition of graph Laplacian matrix. Hence, the proposed algorithm does not require any numerical optimization solvers. Moreover, by maximizing kernel target alignment on labeled data, we can also learn model parameters automatically with a closed-form solution. For a given graph Laplacian matrix, our proposed method does not need to tune any model parameter including the tradeoff parameter in RLS and the balance parameter for unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets show that our proposed two-stage parameter-free spectral kernel learning algorithm can obtain comparable performance with fine-tuned manifold regularization methods in transductive setting, and outperform multiple kernel learning in supervised setting.	Parameter-Free Spectral Kernel Learning
1505.00428v2	Infinite Hidden Markov Models (iHMM's) are an attractive, nonparametric generalization of the classical Hidden Markov Model which can automatically infer the number of hidden states in the system. However, due to the infinite-dimensional nature of transition dynamics performing inference in the iHMM is difficult. In this paper, we present an infinite-state Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm to resample state trajectories for the iHMM. The proposed algorithm uses an efficient proposal optimized for iHMMs and leverages ancestor sampling to suppress degeneracy of the standard PG algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates significant convergence improvements on synthetic and real world data sets. Additionally, the infinite-state PG algorithm has linear-time complexity in the number of states in the sampler, while competing methods scale quadratically.

1711.00882v1	Profiling cellular phenotypes from microscopic imaging can provide meaningful biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells. One motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be captured from images, from which similarities between different drugs applied at different dosages can be quantified. The general approach is to find a function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for cells from a different week, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases. In this case, the particular batch a set of experiments were conducted in constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects). We develop a method for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant biological information. To do this, we minimize a loss function based on the Wasserstein distance. We find for our transformed embeddings (1) the underlying geometric structure is preserved and (2) less domain-specific information is present.	Correcting Nuisance Variation using Wasserstein Distance
1607.02670v1	Additive nonparametric regression models provide an attractive tool for variable selection in high dimensions when the relationship between the response and predictors is complex. They offer greater flexibility compared to parametric non-linear regression models and better interpretability and scalability than the non-parametric regression models. However, achieving sparsity simultaneously in the number of nonparametric components as well as in the variables within each nonparametric component poses a stiff computational challenge. In this article, we develop a novel Bayesian additive regression model using a combination of hard and soft shrinkages to separately control the number of additive components and the variables within each component. An efficient algorithm is developed to select the importance variables and estimate the interaction network. Excellent performance is obtained in simulated and real data examples.	Sparse additive Gaussian process with soft interactions
1409.8630v1	Principal Components Analysis is a widely used technique for dimension reduction and characterization of variability in multivariate populations. Our interest lies in studying when and why the rotation to principal components can be used effectively within a response-predictor set relationship in the context of mode hunting. Specifically focusing on the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM), we first develop a fast version of this algorithm (fastPRIM) under normality which facilitates the theoretical studies to follow. Using basic geometrical arguments, we then demonstrate how the PC rotation of the predictor space alone can in fact generate improved mode estimators. Simulation results are used to illustrate our findings.	Unsupervised Bump Hunting Using Principal Components
1507.06683v1	Symbolic Data Analysis is based on special descriptions of data - symbolic objects (SO). Such descriptions preserve more detailed information about units and their clusters than the usual representations with mean values. A special kind of symbolic object is a representation with frequency or probability distributions (modal values). This representation enables us to consider in the clustering process the variables of all measurement types at the same time. In the paper a clustering criterion function for SOs is proposed such that the representative of each cluster is again composed of distributions of variables' values over the cluster. The corresponding leaders clustering method is based on this result. It is also shown that for the corresponding agglomerative hierarchical method a generalized Ward's formula holds. Both methods are compatible - they are solving the same clustering optimization problem. The leaders method efficiently solves clustering problems with large number of units; while the agglomerative method can be applied alone on the smaller data set, or it could be applied on leaders, obtained with compatible nonhierarchical clustering method. Such a combination of two compatible methods enables us to decide upon the right number of clusters on the basis of the corresponding dendrogram. The proposed methods were applied on different data sets. In the paper, some results of clustering of ESS data are presented.	Clustering of Modal Valued Symbolic Data
1508.03106v2	Most existing binary classification methods target on the optimization of the overall classification risk and may fail to serve some real-world applications such as cancer diagnosis, where users are more concerned with the risk of misclassifying one specific class than the other. Neyman-Pearson (NP) paradigm was introduced in this context as a novel statistical framework for handling asymmetric type I/II error priorities. It seeks classifiers with a minimal type II error and a constrained type I error under a user specified level. This article is the first attempt to construct classifiers with guaranteed theoretical performance under the NP paradigm in high-dimensional settings. Based on the fundamental Neyman-Pearson Lemma, we used a plug-in approach to construct NP-type classifiers for Naive Bayes models. The proposed classifiers satisfy the NP oracle inequalities, which are natural NP paradigm counterparts of the oracle inequalities in classical binary classification. Besides their desirable theoretical properties, we also demonstrated their numerical advantages in prioritized error control via both simulation and real data studies.	Neyman-Pearson Classification under High-Dimensional Settings
1407.5602v1	The use of machine-learning in neuroimaging offers new perspectives in early diagnosis and prognosis of brain diseases. Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (l2 penalty) or scattered (l1 penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of l1, l2, and TV penalties while preserving the exact l1 penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions.

0809.0492v1	We model anomaly and change in data by embedding the data in an ultrametric space. Taking our initial data as cross-tabulation counts (or other input data formats), Correspondence Analysis allows us to endow the information space with a Euclidean metric. We then model anomaly or change by an induced ultrametric. The induced ultrametric that we are particularly interested in takes a sequential - e.g. temporal - ordering of the data into account. We apply this work to the flow of narrative expressed in the film script of the Casablanca movie; and to the evolution between 1988 and 2004 of the Colombian social conflict and violence.	From Data to the p-Adic or Ultrametric Model
1404.7236v1	Graphical models are commonly used tools for modeling multivariate random variables. While there exist many convenient multivariate distributions such as Gaussian distribution for continuous data, mixed data with the presence of discrete variables or a combination of both continuous and discrete variables poses new challenges in statistical modeling. In this paper, we propose a semiparametric model named latent Gaussian copula model for binary and mixed data. The observed binary data are assumed to be obtained by dichotomizing a latent variable satisfying the Gaussian copula distribution or the nonparanormal distribution. The latent Gaussian model with the assumption that the latent variables are multivariate Gaussian is a special case of the proposed model. A novel rank-based approach is proposed for both latent graph estimation and latent principal component analysis. Theoretically, the proposed methods achieve the same rates of convergence for both precision matrix estimation and eigenvector estimation, as if the latent variables were observed. Under similar conditions, the consistency of graph structure recovery and feature selection for leading eigenvectors is established. The performance of the proposed methods is numerically assessed through simulation studies, and the usage of our methods is illustrated by a genetic dataset.	High Dimensional Semiparametric Latent Graphical Model for Mixed Data
1106.0730v2	We show how to control the generalization error of time series models wherein past values of the outcome are used to predict future values. The results are based on a generalization of standard i.i.d. concentration inequalities to dependent data without the mixing assumptions common in the time series setting. Our proof and the result are simpler than previous analyses with dependent data or stochastic adversaries which use sequential Rademacher complexities rather than the expected Rademacher complexity for i.i.d. processes. We also derive empirical Rademacher results without mixing assumptions resulting in fully calculable upper bounds.	Rademacher complexity of stationary sequences
1109.6804v1	Modelling the real world complexity of music is a challenge for machine learning. We address the task of modeling melodic sequences from the same music genre. We perform a comparative analysis of two probabilistic models; a Dirichlet Variable Length Markov Model (Dirichlet-VMM) and a Time Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TC-RBM). We show that the TC-RBM learns descriptive music features, such as underlying chords and typical melody transitions and dynamics. We assess the models for future prediction and compare their performance to a VMM, which is the current state of the art in melody generation. We show that both models perform significantly better than the VMM, with the Dirichlet-VMM marginally outperforming the TC-RBM. Finally, we evaluate the short order statistics of the models, using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between test sequences and model samples, and show that our proposed methods match the statistics of the music genre significantly better than the VMM.	Comparing Probabilistic Models for Melodic Sequences
1202.3779v1	We propose a method that infers whether linear relations between two high-dimensional variables X and Y are due to a causal influence from X to Y or from Y to X. The earlier proposed so-called Trace Method is extended to the regime where the dimension of the observed variables exceeds the sample size. Based on previous work, we postulate conditions that characterize a causal relation between X and Y. Moreover, we describe a statistical test and argue that both causal directions are typically rejected if there is a common cause. A full theoretical analysis is presented for the deterministic case but our approach seems to be valid for the noisy case, too, for which we additionally present an approach based on a sparsity constraint. The discussed method yields promising results for both simulated and real world data.	Testing whether linear equations are causal: A free probability theory  approach
1801.09367v1	The vanishing ideal is a set of polynomials that takes zero value on the given data points. Originally proposed in computer algebra, the vanishing ideal has been recently exploited for extracting the nonlinear structures of data in many applications. To avoid overfitting to noisy data, the polynomials are often designed to approximately rather than exactly equal zero on the designated data. Although such approximations empirically demonstrate high performance, the sound algebraic structure of the vanishing ideal is lost. The present paper proposes a vanishing ideal that is tolerant to noisy data and also pursued to have a better algebraic structure. As a new problem, we simultaneously find a set of polynomials and data points for which the polynomials approximately vanish on the input data points, and almost exactly vanish on the discovered data points. In experimental classification tests, our method discovered much fewer and lower-degree polynomials than an existing state-of-the-art method. Consequently, our method accelerated the runtime of the classification tasks without degrading the classification accuracy.	Approximate Vanishing Ideal via Data Knotting
1109.3248v1	We introduce the problem of reconstructing a sequence of multidimensional real vectors where some of the data are missing. This problem contains regression and mapping inversion as particular cases where the pattern of missing data is independent of the sequence index. The problem is hard because it involves possibly multivalued mappings at each vector in the sequence, where the missing variables can take more than one value given the present variables; and the set of missing variables can vary from one vector to the next. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm based on two redundancy assumptions: vector redundancy (the data live in a low-dimensional manifold), so that the present variables constrain the missing ones; and sequence redundancy (e.g. continuity), so that consecutive vectors constrain each other. We capture the low-dimensional nature of the data in a probabilistic way with a joint density model, here the generative topographic mapping, which results in a Gaussian mixture. Candidate reconstructions at each vector are obtained as all the modes of the conditional distribution of missing variables given present variables. The reconstructed sequence is obtained by minimising a global constraint, here the sequence length, by dynamic programming. We present experimental results for a toy problem and for inverse kinematics of a robot arm.	Reconstruction of sequential data with density models
1109.4389v1	We present a probabilistic model for natural images which is based on Gaussian scale mixtures and a simple multiscale representation. In contrast to the dominant approach to modeling whole images focusing on Markov random fields, we formulate our model in terms of a directed graphical model. We show that it is able to generate images with interesting higher-order correlations when trained on natural images or samples from an occlusion based model. More importantly, the directed model enables us to perform a principled evaluation. While it is easy to generate visually appealing images, we demonstrate that our model also yields the best performance reported to date when evaluated with respect to the cross-entropy rate, a measure tightly linked to the average log-likelihood.

1303.3265v2	The fundamental aim of clustering algorithms is to partition data points. We consider tasks where the discovered partition is allowed to vary with some covariate such as space or time. One approach would be to use fragmentation-coagulation processes, but these, being Markov processes, are restricted to linear or tree structured covariate spaces. We define a partition-valued process on an arbitrary covariate space using Gaussian processes. We use the process to construct a multitask clustering model which partitions datapoints in a similar way across multiple data sources, and a time series model of network data which allows cluster assignments to vary over time. We describe sampling algorithms for inference and apply our method to defining cancer subtypes based on different types of cellular characteristics, finding regulatory modules from gene expression data from multiple human populations, and discovering time varying community structure in a social network.

1502.00727v5	Laplacian mixture models identify overlapping regions of influence in unlabeled graph and network data in a scalable and computationally efficient way, yielding useful low-dimensional representations. By combining Laplacian eigenspace and finite mixture modeling methods, they provide probabilistic dimensionality reductions or domain decompositions for a variety of input data types, including mixture distributions, feature vectors, and graphs or networks. Heuristic approximations for scalable high-performance implementations are described and empirically tested. Connections to PageRank and community detection in network analysis demonstrate the wide applicability of this approach. The origins of Laplacian mixture models derive from partial differential equations in physics, which are reviewed and summarized. Comparisons to other dimensionality reduction and clustering methods for challenging unsupervised machine learning problems are also discussed.

1202.0825v1	"Many modern data mining applications are concerned with the analysis of datasets in which the observations are described by paired high-dimensional vectorial representations or ""views"". Some typical examples can be found in web mining and genomics applications. In this article we present an algorithm for data clustering with multiple views, Multi-View Predictive Partitioning (MVPP), which relies on a novel criterion of predictive similarity between data points. We assume that, within each cluster, the dependence between multivariate views can be modelled by using a two-block partial least squares (TB-PLS) regression model, which performs dimensionality reduction and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional settings. The proposed MVPP algorithm partitions the data such that the within-cluster predictive ability between views is maximised. The proposed objective function depends on a measure of predictive influence of points under the TB-PLS model which has been derived as an extension of the PRESS statistic commonly used in ordinary least squares regression. Using simulated data, we compare the performance of MVPP to that of competing multi-view clustering methods which rely upon geometric structures of points, but ignore the predictive relationship between the two views. State-of-art results are obtained on benchmark web mining datasets."	Multi-view predictive partitioning in high dimensions
1507.03285v1	Linear regression models depend directly on the design matrix and its properties. Techniques that efficiently estimate model coefficients by partitioning rows of the design matrix are increasingly popular for large-scale problems because they fit well with modern parallel computing architectures. We propose a simple measure of {\em concordance} between a design matrix and a subset of its rows that estimates how well a subset captures the variance-covariance structure of a larger data set. We illustrate the use of this measure in a heuristic method for selecting row partition sizes that balance statistical and computational efficiency goals in real-world problems.

1706.09985v1	A rising topic in computational journalism is how to enhance the diversity in news served to subscribers to foster exploration behavior in news reading. Despite the success of preference learning in personalized news recommendation, their over-exploitation causes filter bubble that isolates readers from opposing viewpoints and hurts long-term user experiences with lack of serendipity. Since news providers can recommend neither opposite nor diversified opinions if unpopularity of these articles is surely predicted, they can only bet on the articles whose forecasts of click-through rate involve high variability (risks) or high estimation errors (uncertainties). We propose a novel Bayesian model of uncertainty-aware scoring and ranking for news articles. The Bayesian binary classifier models probability of success (defined as a news click) as a Beta-distributed random variable conditional on a vector of the context (user features, article features, and other contextual features). The posterior of the contextual coefficients can be computed efficiently using a low-rank version of Laplace's method via thin Singular Value Decomposition. Efficiencies in personalized targeting of exceptional articles, which are chosen by each subscriber in test period, are evaluated on real-world news datasets. The proposed estimator slightly outperformed existing training and scoring algorithms, in terms of efficiency in identifying successful outliers.	Towards Bursting Filter Bubble via Contextual Risks and Uncertainties
1609.08235v1	With the scale of data growing every day, reducing the dimensionality (a.k.a. sketching) of high-dimensional data has emerged as a task of paramount importance. Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume of data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format of acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these challenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning approach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical (bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit and Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process lying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies on low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized maximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via alternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical data `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new incomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight first-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an extra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly along with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models. Performance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite data streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary point set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear regret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes for real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification.

1404.2124v1	Predicting an individual's risk of experiencing a future clinical outcome is a statistical task with important consequences for both practicing clinicians and public health experts. Modern observational databases such as electronic health records (EHRs) provide an alternative to the longitudinal cohort studies traditionally used to construct risk models, bringing with them both opportunities and challenges. Large sample sizes and detailed covariate histories enable the use of sophisticated machine learning techniques to uncover complex associations and interactions, but observational databases are often ``messy,'' with high levels of missing data and incomplete patient follow-up. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the well-known Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning approach for classification to time-to-event outcomes subject to censoring. We compare the predictive performance of our method to the Cox proportional hazards model which is commonly used for risk prediction in healthcare populations, and illustrate its application to prediction of cardiovascular risk using an EHR dataset from a large Midwest integrated healthcare system.	A Naive Bayes machine learning approach to risk prediction using  censored, time-to-event data
1303.2378v2	We introduce a new approach to variable selection, called Predictive Correlation Screening, for predictor design. Predictive Correlation Screening (PCS) implements false positive control on the selected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to high dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for Familywise Error Rate (FWER), and resultant mean square error of a linear predictor on the selected variables. We apply Predictive Correlation Screening to the following two-stage predictor design problem. An experimenter wants to learn a multivariate predictor of gene expressions based on successive biological samples assayed on mRNA arrays. She assays the whole genome on a few samples and from these assays she selects a small number of variables using Predictive Correlation Screening. To reduce assay cost, she subsequently assays only the selected variables on the remaining samples, to learn the predictor coefficients. We show superiority of Predictive Correlation Screening relative to LASSO and correlation learning (sometimes popularly referred to in the literature as marginal regression or simple thresholding) in terms of performance and computational complexity.	Predictive Correlation Screening: Application to Two-stage Predictor  Design in High Dimension
1611.06740v2	This work brings together two powerful concepts in Gaussian processes: the variational approach to sparse approximation and the spectral representation of Gaussian processes. This gives rise to an approximation that inherits the benefits of the variational approach but with the representational power and computational scalability of spectral representations. The work hinges on a key result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances. We derive these expressions for Matern kernels in one dimension, and generalize to more dimensions using kernels with specific structures. Under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise, our method requires only a single pass through the dataset, making for very fast and accurate computation. We fit a model to 4 million training points in just a few minutes on a standard laptop. With non-conjugate likelihoods, our MCMC scheme reduces the cost of computation from O(NM2) (for a sparse Gaussian process) to O(NM) per iteration, where N is the number of data and M is the number of features.

1401.2771v1	Recently, a number of mostly $\ell_1$-norm regularized least squares type deterministic algorithms have been proposed to address the problem of \emph{sparse} adaptive signal estimation and system identification. From a Bayesian perspective, this task is equivalent to maximum a posteriori probability estimation under a sparsity promoting heavy-tailed prior for the parameters of interest. Following a different approach, this paper develops a unifying framework of sparse \emph{variational Bayes} algorithms that employ heavy-tailed priors in conjugate hierarchical form to facilitate posterior inference. The resulting fully automated variational schemes are first presented in a batch iterative form. Then it is shown that by properly exploiting the structure of the batch estimation task, new sparse adaptive variational Bayes algorithms can be derived, which have the ability to impose and track sparsity during real-time processing in a time-varying environment. The most important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they completely eliminate the need for computationally costly parameter fine-tuning, a necessary ingredient of sparse adaptive deterministic algorithms. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new sparse variational Bayes algorithms against state-of-the-art deterministic techniques for adaptive channel estimation. The results show that the proposed algorithms are numerically robust and exhibit in general superior estimation performance compared to their deterministic counterparts.	A variational Bayes framework for sparse adaptive estimation
1703.08065v2	The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has recently been successfully applied in robust regression, classification and adaptive filtering, where the correntropy is maximized instead of minimizing the well-known mean square error (MSE) to improve the robustness with respect to outliers (or impulsive noises). Considerable efforts have been devoted to develop various robust adaptive algorithms under MCC, but so far little insight has been gained as to how the optimal solution will be affected by outliers. In this work, we study this problem in the context of parameter estimation for a simple linear errors-in-variables (EIV) model where all variables are scalar. Under certain conditions, we derive an upper bound on the absolute value of the estimation error and show that the optimal solution under MCC can be very close to the true value of the unknown parameter even with outliers (whose values can be arbitrarily large) in both input and output variables. Illustrative examples are presented to verify and clarify the theory.	Robustness of Maximum Correntropy Estimation Against Large Outliers
1610.09600v4	Exploiting the fact that most arrival processes exhibit cyclic behaviour, we propose a simple procedure for estimating the intensity of a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The estimator is the super-resolution analogue to Shao 2010 and Shao & Lii 2011, which is a sum of $p$ sinusoids where $p$ and the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each wave are not known and need to be estimated. This results in an interpretable yet flexible specification that is suitable for use in modelling as well as in high resolution simulations. Our estimation procedure sits in between classic periodogram methods and atomic/total variation norm thresholding. Through a novel use of window functions in the point process domain, our approach attains super-resolution without semidefinite programming. Under suitable conditions, finite sample guarantees can be derived for our procedure. These resolve some open questions and expand existing results in spectral estimation literature.

1501.03861v1	Using nonparametric methods has been increasingly explored in Bayesian hierarchical modeling as a way to increase model flexibility. Although the field shows a lot of promise, inference in many models, including Hierachical Dirichlet Processes (HDP), remain prohibitively slow. One promising path forward is to exploit the submodularity inherent in Indian Buffet Process (IBP) to derive near-optimal solutions in polynomial time. In this work, I will present a brief tutorial on Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially as they are applied to topic modeling. I will show a comparison between different non-parametric models and the current state-of-the-art parametric model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).	Bayesian Nonparametrics in Topic Modeling: A Brief Tutorial
0712.0248v1	This monograph deals with adaptive supervised classification, using tools borrowed from statistical mechanics and information theory, stemming from the PACBayesian approach pioneered by David McAllester and applied to a conception of statistical learning theory forged by Vladimir Vapnik. Using convex analysis on the set of posterior probability measures, we show how to get local measures of the complexity of the classification model involving the relative entropy of posterior distributions with respect to Gibbs posterior measures. We then discuss relative bounds, comparing the generalization error of two classification rules, showing how the margin assumption of Mammen and Tsybakov can be replaced with some empirical measure of the covariance structure of the classification model.We show how to associate to any posterior distribution an effective temperature relating it to the Gibbs prior distribution with the same level of expected error rate, and how to estimate this effective temperature from data, resulting in an estimator whose expected error rate converges according to the best possible power of the sample size adaptively under any margin and parametric complexity assumptions. We describe and study an alternative selection scheme based on relative bounds between estimators, and present a two step localization technique which can handle the selection of a parametric model from a family of those. We show how to extend systematically all the results obtained in the inductive setting to transductive learning, and use this to improve Vapnik's generalization bounds, extending them to the case when the sample is made of independent non-identically distributed pairs of patterns and labels. Finally we review briefly the construction of Support Vector Machines and show how to derive generalization bounds for them, measuring the complexity either through the number of support vectors or through the value of the transductive or inductive margin.

1112.4463v1	We propose a hybrid algorithmic strategy for complex stochastic optimization problems, which combines the use of scenario trees from multistage stochastic programming with machine learning techniques for learning a policy in the form of a statistical model, in the context of constrained vector-valued decisions. Such a policy allows one to run out-of-sample simulations over a large number of independent scenarios, and obtain a signal on the quality of the approximation scheme used to solve the multistage stochastic program. We propose to apply this fast simulation technique to choose the best tree from a set of scenario trees. A solution scheme is introduced, where several scenario trees with random branching structure are solved in parallel, and where the tree from which the best policy for the true problem could be learned is ultimately retained. Numerical tests show that excellent trade-offs can be achieved between run times and solution quality.

1007.1075v1	"A popular method for selecting the number of clusters is based on stability arguments: one chooses the number of clusters such that the corresponding clustering results are ""most stable"". In recent years, a series of papers has analyzed the behavior of this method from a theoretical point of view. However, the results are very technical and difficult to interpret for non-experts. In this paper we give a high-level overview about the existing literature on clustering stability. In addition to presenting the results in a slightly informal but accessible way, we relate them to each other and discuss their different implications."	Clustering Stability: An Overview
1111.6832v2	While Gaussian probability densities are omnipresent in applied mathematics, Gaussian cumulative probabilities are hard to calculate in any but the univariate case. We study the utility of Expectation Propagation (EP) as an approximate integration method for this problem. For rectangular integration regions, the approximation is highly accurate. We also extend the derivations to the more general case of polyhedral integration regions. However, we find that in this polyhedral case, EP's answer, though often accurate, can be almost arbitrarily wrong. We consider these unexpected results empirically and theoretically, both for the problem of Gaussian probabilities and for EP more generally. These results elucidate an interesting and non-obvious feature of EP not yet studied in detail.	Gaussian Probabilities and Expectation Propagation

We use this approximation to derive a finite sum-representation that converges almost surely to Ferguson's representation of the Dirichlet process based on arrivals of a homogeneous Poisson process. We compare the efficiency of our approximation to several other well known approximations of the Dirichlet process and demonstrate a substantial improvement.

1706.06150v2	The infinitesimal jackknife (IJ) has recently been applied to the random forest to estimate its prediction variance. These theorems were verified under a traditional random forest framework which uses classification and regression trees (CART) and bootstrap resampling. However, random forests using conditional inference (CI) trees and subsampling have been found to be not prone to variable selection bias. Here, we conduct simulation experiments using a novel approach to explore the applicability of the IJ to random forests using variations on the resampling method and base learner. Test data points were simulated and each trained using random forest on one hundred simulated training data sets using different combinations of resampling and base learners. Using CI trees instead of traditional CART trees as well as using subsampling instead of bootstrap sampling resulted in a much more accurate estimation of prediction variance when using the IJ. The random forest variations here have been incorporated into an open source software package for the R programming language.

1404.1425v3	Given iid samples from some unknown continuous density on hyper-rectangle $[0, 1]^d$, we attempt to learn a piecewise constant function that approximates this underlying density nonparametrically. Our density estimate is defined on a binary split of $[0, 1]^d$ and built up sequentially according to discrepancy criteria; the key ingredient is to control the discrepancy adaptively in each sub-rectangle to achieve overall bound. We prove that the estimate, even though simple as it appears, preserves most of the estimation power. By exploiting its structure, it can be directly applied to some important pattern recognition tasks such as mode seeking and density landscape exploration, we demonstrate its applicability through simulations and examples.

1711.08037v2	"Calls to arms to build interpretable models express a well-founded discomfort with machine learning. Should a software agent that does not even know what a loan is decide who qualifies for one? Indeed, we ought to be cautious about injecting machine learning (or anything else, for that matter) into applications where there may be a significant risk of causing social harm. However, claims that stakeholders ""just won't accept that!"" do not provide a sufficient foundation for a proposed field of study. For the field of interpretable machine learning to advance, we must ask the following questions: What precisely won't various stakeholders accept? What do they want? Are these desiderata reasonable? Are they feasible? In order to answer these questions, we'll have to give real-world problems and their respective stakeholders greater consideration."	The Doctor Just Won't Accept That!
0911.5107v1	Recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs. This has been motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the problem reduces to specifying an appropriate covariance function that, whilst being positive semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all the data points and across all the outputs. One approach to account for non-trivial correlations between outputs employs convolution processes. Under a latent function interpretation of the convolution transform we establish dependencies between output variables. The main drawbacks of this approach are the associated computational and storage demands. In this paper we address these issues. We present different sparse approximations for dependent output Gaussian processes constructed through the convolution formalism. We exploit the conditional independencies present naturally in the model. This leads to a form of the covariance similar in spirit to the so called PITC and FITC approximations for a single output. We show experimental results with synthetic and real data, in particular, we show results in pollution prediction, school exams score prediction and gene expression data.	Sparse Convolved Multiple Output Gaussian Processes
1205.2171v2	We study the problem of structured output learning from a regression perspective. We first provide a general formulation of the kernel dependency estimation (KDE) problem using operator-valued kernels. We show that some of the existing formulations of this problem are special cases of our framework. We then propose a covariance-based operator-valued kernel that allows us to take into account the structure of the kernel feature space. This kernel operates on the output space and encodes the interactions between the outputs without any reference to the input space. To address this issue, we introduce a variant of our KDE method based on the conditional covariance operator that in addition to the correlation between the outputs takes into account the effects of the input variables. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our KDE approach using both covariance and conditional covariance kernels on two structured output problems, and compare it to the state-of-the-art kernel-based structured output regression methods.

1007.0499v1	Components of biological systems interact with each other in order to carry out vital cell functions. Such information can be used to improve estimation and inference, and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular mechanisms. Discovering regulatory interactions among genes is therefore an important problem in systems biology. Whole-genome expression data over time provides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are affected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore be used to discover regulatory interactions among genes. In this paper, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating lasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression data. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying time series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators. Moreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between activation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We provide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show that the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the large $p$, small $n$ setting. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated favorably in simulated, as well as real, data examples. The proposed truncating lasso method is implemented in the R-package grangerTlasso and is available at this http URL	Discovering Graphical Granger Causality Using the Truncating Lasso  Penalty
1203.3491v1	Logitboost is an influential boosting algorithm for classification. In this paper, we develop robust logitboost to provide an explicit formulation of tree-split criterion for building weak learners (regression trees) for logitboost. This formulation leads to a numerically stable implementation of logitboost. We then propose abc-logitboost for multi-class classification, by combining robust logitboost with the prior work of abc-boost. Previously, abc-boost was implemented as abc-mart using the mart algorithm. Our extensive experiments on multi-class classification compare four algorithms: mart, abcmart, (robust) logitboost, and abc-logitboost, and demonstrate the superiority of abc-logitboost. Comparisons with other learning methods including SVM and deep learning are also available through prior publications.	Robust LogitBoost and Adaptive Base Class (ABC) LogitBoost
1705.07168v1	Data-driven Distributionally Robust Optimization (DD-DRO) via optimal transport has been shown to encompass a wide range of popular machine learning algorithms. The distributional uncertainty size is often shown to correspond to the regularization parameter. The type of regularization (e.g. the norm used to regularize) corresponds to the shape of the distributional uncertainty. We propose a data-driven robust optimization methodology to inform the transportation cost underlying the definition of the distributional uncertainty. We show empirically that this additional layer of robustification, which produces a method we called doubly robust data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DD-R-DRO), allows to enhance the generalization properties of regularized estimators while reducing testing error relative to state-of-the-art classifiers in a wide range of data sets.

1508.04319v1	We present a novel approach for fully non-stationary Gaussian process regression (GPR), where all three key parameters -- noise variance, signal variance and lengthscale -- can be simultaneously input-dependent. We develop gradient-based inference methods to learn the unknown function and the non-stationary model parameters, without requiring any model approximations. We propose to infer full parameter posterior with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which conveniently extends the analytical gradient-based GPR learning by guiding the sampling with model gradients. We also learn the MAP solution from the posterior by gradient ascent. In experiments on several synthetic datasets and in modelling of temporal gene expression, the nonstationary GPR is shown to be necessary for modeling realistic input-dependent dynamics, while it performs comparably to conventional stationary or previous non-stationary GPR models otherwise.

1203.5181v1	We describe $k$-MLE, a fast and efficient local search algorithm for learning finite statistical mixtures of exponential families such as Gaussian mixture models. Mixture models are traditionally learned using the expectation-maximization (EM) soft clustering technique that monotonically increases the incomplete (expected complete) likelihood. Given prescribed mixture weights, the hard clustering $k$-MLE algorithm iteratively assigns data to the most likely weighted component and update the component models using Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs). Using the duality between exponential families and Bregman divergences, we prove that the local convergence of the complete likelihood of $k$-MLE follows directly from the convergence of a dual additively weighted Bregman hard clustering. The inner loop of $k$-MLE can be implemented using any $k$-means heuristic like the celebrated Lloyd's batched or Hartigan's greedy swap updates. We then show how to update the mixture weights by minimizing a cross-entropy criterion that implies to update weights by taking the relative proportion of cluster points, and reiterate the mixture parameter update and mixture weight update processes until convergence. Hard EM is interpreted as a special case of $k$-MLE when both the component update and the weight update are performed successively in the inner loop. To initialize $k$-MLE, we propose $k$-MLE++, a careful initialization of $k$-MLE guaranteeing probabilistically a global bound on the best possible complete likelihood.	$k$-MLE: A fast algorithm for learning statistical mixture models

1603.03972v2	Manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are ubiquitous in science and engineering, but can be computationally expensive procedures when applied to large data sets or when similarities are expensive to compute. To date, little work has been done to investigate the tradeoff between computational resources and the quality of learned representations. We present both theoretical and experimental explorations of this question. In particular, we consider Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings based on a kernel matrix, and explore how the embeddings behave when this kernel matrix is corrupted by occlusion and noise. Our main theoretical result shows that under modest noise and occlusion assumptions, we can (with high probability) recover a good approximation to the Laplacian eigenmaps embedding based on the uncorrupted kernel matrix. Our results also show how regularization can aid this approximation. Experimentally, we explore the effects of noise and occlusion on Laplacian eigenmaps embeddings of two real-world data sets, one from speech processing and one from neuroscience, as well as a synthetic data set.

1202.2194v4	Supervised statistical classification is a vital tool for satellite image processing. It is useful not only when a discrete result, such as feature extraction or surface type, is required, but also for continuum retrievals by dividing the quantity of interest into discrete ranges. Because of the high resolution of modern satellite instruments and because of the requirement for real-time processing, any algorithm has to be fast to be useful. Here we describe an algorithm based on kernel estimation called Adaptive Gaussian Filtering that incorporates several innovations to produce superior efficiency as compared to three other popular methods: k-nearest-neighbour (KNN), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This efficiency is gained with no compromises: accuracy is maintained, while estimates of the conditional probabilities are returned. These are useful not only to gauge the accuracy of an estimate in the absence of its true value, but also to re-calibrate a retrieved image and as a proxy for a discretized continuum variable. The algorithm is demonstrated and compared with the other three on a pair of synthetic test classes and to map the waterways of the Netherlands.

1701.07920v1	Subset selection in multiple linear regression is to choose a subset of candidate explanatory variables that tradeoff error and the number of variables selected. We built mathematical programming models for subset selection and compare the performance of an LP-based branch-and-bound algorithm with tailored valid inequalities to known heuristics. We found that our models quickly find a quality solution while the rest of the time is spent to prove optimality. Our models are also applicable with slight modifications to the case with more candidate explanatory variables than observations. For this case, we provide mathematical programming models, propose new criteria, and develop heuristic algorithms based on mathematical programming.

1410.2653v1	"Distributed learning of probabilistic models from multiple data repositories with minimum communication is increasingly important. We study a simple communication-efficient learning framework that first calculates the local maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based on the data subsets, and then combines the local MLEs to achieve the best possible approximation to the global MLE given the whole dataset. We study this framework's statistical properties, showing that the efficiency loss compared to the global setting relates to how much the underlying distribution families deviate from full exponential families, drawing connection to the theory of information loss by Fisher, Rao and Efron. We show that the ""full-exponential-family-ness"" represents the lower bound of the error rate of arbitrary combinations of local MLEs, and is achieved by a KL-divergence-based combination method but not by a more common linear combination method. We also study the empirical properties of both methods, showing that the KL method significantly outperforms linear combination in practical settings with issues such as model misspecification, non-convexity, and heterogeneous data partitions."

1212.1666v2	There have lately been several suggestions for parametrized distances on a graph that generalize the shortest path distance and the commute time or resistance distance. The need for developing such distances has risen from the observation that the above-mentioned common distances in many situations fail to take into account the global structure of the graph. In this article, we develop the theory of one family of graph node distances, known as the randomized shortest path dissimilarity, which has its foundation in statistical physics. We show that the randomized shortest path dissimilarity can be easily computed in closed form for all pairs of nodes of a graph. Moreover, we come up with a new definition of a distance measure that we call the free energy distance. The free energy distance can be seen as an upgrade of the randomized shortest path dissimilarity as it defines a metric, in addition to which it satisfies the graph-geodetic property. The derivation and computation of the free energy distance are also straightforward. We then make a comparison between a set of generalized distances that interpolate between the shortest path distance and the commute time, or resistance distance. This comparison focuses on the applicability of the distances in graph node clustering and classification. The comparison, in general, shows that the parametrized distances perform well in the tasks. In particular, we see that the results obtained with the free energy distance are among the best in all the experiments.

1111.1915v1	"The popular cubic smoothing spline estimate of a regression function arises as the minimizer of the penalized sum of squares $\sum_j(Y_j - {\mu}(t_j))^2 + {\lambda}\int_a^b [{\mu}""(t)]^2 dt$, where the data are $t_j,Y_j$, $j=1,..., n$. The minimization is taken over an infinite-dimensional function space, the space of all functions with square integrable second derivatives. But the calculations can be carried out in a finite-dimensional space. The reduction from minimizing over an infinite dimensional space to minimizing over a finite dimensional space occurs for more general objective functions: the data may be related to the function ${\mu}$ in another way, the sum of squares may be replaced by a more suitable expression, or the penalty, $\int_a^b [{\mu}""(t)]^2 dt$, might take a different form. This paper reviews the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space structure that provides a finite-dimensional solution for a general minimization problem. Particular attention is paid to penalties based on linear differential operators. In this case, one can sometimes easily calculate the minimizer explicitly, using Green's functions."

1601.05285v3	We present a method of variable selection for the situation where some predictors are nonlinearly associated with a continuous outcome variable. The method doesn't assume any specific functional form, and can select from a large number of candidates. It takes the form of incremental forward stagewise regression, in which very small steps are taken to select the variables. Given no functional form is assumed, we devised an approach termed roughening to adjust the residuals in the iterations. In simulations, we show the new method is competitive against popular machine learning approaches. We also demonstrate its performance using some real datasets.

1605.09499v6	We propose extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), an asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference on massive real world datasets. Stochastic variational inference (SVI), the state-of-the-art algorithm for scaling variational inference to large-datasets, is inherently serial. Moreover, it requires the parameters to fit in the memory of a single processor; this is problematic when the number of parameters is in billions. ESVI overcomes these limitations by requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a subset of the parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESVI by running Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on UMBC-3B, a dataset that has a vocabulary of 3 million and a token size of 3 billion. To best of our knowledge, this is an order of magnitude larger than the largest dataset on which results using variational inference have been reported in literature. In our experiments, we found that ESVI outperforms VI and SVI, and also achieves a better quality solution. In addition, we propose a strategy to speed up computation and save memory when fitting large number of topics.	Extreme Stochastic Variational Inference: Distributed and Asynchronous
0910.1022v3	We develop the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (CRP), a flexible class of distributions over partitions that allows for non-exchangeability. This class can be used to model many kinds of dependencies between data in infinite clustering models, including dependencies across time or space. We examine the properties of the distance dependent CRP, discuss its connections to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, and derive a Gibbs sampler for both observed and mixture settings. We study its performance with three text corpora. We show that relaxing the assumption of exchangeability with distance dependent CRPs can provide a better fit to sequential data. We also show its alternative formulation of the traditional CRP leads to a faster-mixing Gibbs sampling algorithm than the one based on the original formulation.

1704.02828v2	Computing accurate estimates of the Fourier transform of analog signals from discrete data points is important in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional approach of performing the discrete Fourier transform of the data implicitly assumes periodicity and bandlimitedness of the signal. In this paper, we use Gaussian process regression to estimate the Fourier transform (or any other integral transform) without making these assumptions. This is possible because the posterior expectation of Gaussian process regression maps a finite set of samples to a function defined on the whole real line, expressed as a linear combination of covariance functions. We estimate the covariance function from the data using an appropriately designed gradient ascent method that constrains the solution to a linear combination of tractable kernel functions. This procedure results in a posterior expectation of the analog signal whose Fourier transform can be obtained analytically by exploiting linearity. Our simulations show that the new method leads to sharper and more precise estimation of the spectral density both in noise-free and noise-corrupted signals. We further validate the method in two real-world applications: the analysis of the yearly fluctuation in atmospheric CO2 level and the analysis of the spectral content of brain signals.

1706.09411v2	The restricted isometry property (RIP) is a universal tool for data recovery. We explore the implication of the RIP in the framework of generalized sparsity and group measurements introduced in the Part I paper. It turns out that for a given measurement instrument the number of measurements for RIP can be improved by optimizing over families of Banach spaces. Second, we investigate the preservation of difference of two sparse vectors, which is not trivial in generalized models. Third, we extend the RIP of partial Fourier measurements at optimal scaling of number of measurements with random sign to far more general group structured measurements. Lastly, we also obtain RIP in infinite dimension in the context of Fourier measurement concepts with sparsity naturally replaced by smoothness assumptions.

1410.7371v1	Advances of modern sensing and sequencing technologies generate a deluge of high dimensional space-temporal physiological and next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Physiological traits are observed either as continuous random functions, or on a dense grid and referred to as function-valued traits. Both physiological and NGS data are highly correlated data with their inherent order, spacing, and functional nature which are ignored by traditional summary-based univariate and multivariate regression methods designed for quantitative genetic analysis of scalar trait and common variants. To capture morphological and dynamic features of the data and utilize their dependent structure, we propose a functional linear model (FLM) in which a trait curve is modeled as a response function, the genetic variation in a genomic region or gene is modeled as a functional predictor, and the genetic effects are modeled as a function of both time and genomic position (FLMF) for genetic analysis of function-valued trait with both GWAS and NGS data. By extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the FLMF has the correct type 1 error rates and much higher power to detect association than the existing methods. The FLMF is applied to sleep data from Starr County health studies where oxygen saturation were measured in 22,670 seconds on average for 833 individuals. We found 65 genes that were significantly associated with oxygen saturation functional trait with P-values ranging from 2.40E-06 to 2.53E-21. The results clearly demonstrate that the FLMF substantially outperforms the traditional genetic models with scalar trait.	A General Statistic Framework for Genome-based Disease Risk Prediction
1607.03300v1	"Machine learning is the science of discovering statistical dependencies in data, and the use of those dependencies to perform predictions. During the last decade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human performance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and computer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning avoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way forward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human intelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms. Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships between the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide understanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen environments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer ""what if"" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under hypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and effect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine intelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in specific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in practice. This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways. First, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on copulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret the problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification, yielding a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover causal structures in convolutional neural network features using our algorithms. The algorithms presented in this thesis are scalable, exhibit strong theoretical guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a variety of real-world benchmarks."

1608.02280v1	Recently, a general method for analyzing the statistical accuracy of the EM algorithm has been developed and applied to some simple latent variable models [Balakrishnan et al. 2016]. In that method, the basin of attraction for valid initialization is required to be a ball around the truth. Using Stein's Lemma, we extend these results in the case of estimating the centers of a two-component Gaussian mixture in $d$ dimensions. In particular, we significantly expand the basin of attraction to be the intersection of a half space and a ball around the origin. If the signal-to-noise ratio is at least a constant multiple of $ \sqrt{d\log d} $, we show that a random initialization strategy is feasible.

1112.4607v1	The success of kernel-based learning methods depend on the choice of kernel. Recently, kernel learning methods have been proposed that use data to select the most appropriate kernel, usually by combining a set of base kernels. We introduce a new algorithm for kernel learning that combines a {\em continuous set of base kernels}, without the common step of discretizing the space of base kernels. We demonstrate that our new method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of real-world datasets. Furthermore, we explicitly demonstrate the importance of combining the right dictionary of kernels, which is problematic for methods based on a finite set of base kernels chosen a priori. Our method is not the first approach to work with continuously parameterized kernels. However, we show that our method requires substantially less computation than previous such approaches, and so is more amenable to multiple dimensional parameterizations of base kernels, which we demonstrate.

1006.1346v2	Sparse modeling is a powerful framework for data analysis and processing. Traditionally, encoding in this framework is performed by solving an L1-regularized linear regression problem, commonly referred to as Lasso or Basis Pursuit. In this work we combine the sparsity-inducing property of the Lasso model at the individual feature level, with the block-sparsity property of the Group Lasso model, where sparse groups of features are jointly encoded, obtaining a sparsity pattern hierarchically structured. This results in the Hierarchical Lasso (HiLasso), which shows important practical modeling advantages. We then extend this approach to the collaborative case, where a set of simultaneously coded signals share the same sparsity pattern at the higher (group) level, but not necessarily at the lower (inside the group) level, obtaining the collaborative HiLasso model (C-HiLasso). Such signals then share the same active groups, or classes, but not necessarily the same active set. This model is very well suited for applications such as source identification and separation. An efficient optimization procedure, which guarantees convergence to the global optimum, is developed for these new models. The underlying presentation of the new framework and optimization approach is complemented with experimental examples and theoretical results regarding recovery guarantees for the proposed models.

We also provide a mini-batch extension which enables to compute the matrix factorization on big datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on a real dataset and give comparisons with well-known algorithms such as stochastic gradient matrix factorization and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF).

Given a graph constructed from a random sample of a $d$-dimensional compact submanifold $M$ in $\mathbb{R}^D$, we establish the spectral convergence rate of the graph Laplacian. It implies the consistency of the spectral clustering algorithm via a standard perturbation argument. A simple numerical study indicates the necessity of a denoising step before applying spectral algorithms.	Spectral Convergence Rate of Graph Laplacian
1506.02699v2	In recent years there has been an increased interest in statistical analysis of data with multiple types of relations among a set of entities. Such multi-relational data can be represented as multi-layer graphs where the set of vertices represents the entities and multiple types of edges represent the different relations among them. For community detection in multi-layer graphs, we consider two random graph models, the multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (MLSBM) and a model with a restricted parameter space, the restricted multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (RMLSBM). We derive consistency results for community assignments of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) in both models where MLSBM is assumed to be the true model, and either the number of nodes or the number of types of edges or both grow. We compare MLEs in the two models with other baseline approaches, such as separate modeling of layers, aggregating the layers and majority voting. RMLSBM is shown to have advantage over MLSBM when either the growth rate of the number of communities is high or the growth rate of the average degree of the component graphs in the multi-graph is low. We also derive minimax rates of error and sharp thresholds for achieving consistency of community detection in both models, which are then used to compare the multi-layer models with a baseline model, the aggregate stochastic block model. The simulation studies and real data applications confirm the superior performance of the multi-layer approaches in comparison to the baseline procedures.

1111.6233v1	Gaussian process models -also called Kriging models- are often used as mathematical approximations of expensive experiments. However, the number of observation required for building an emulator becomes unrealistic when using classical covariance kernels when the dimension of input increases.

The ambition of the present work is to give an insight into covariance kernels that are well suited for building additive Kriging models and to describe some properties of the resulting models.

1203.3534v1	In nonlinear latent variable models or dynamic models, if we consider the latent variables as confounders (common causes), the noise dependencies imply further relations between the observed variables. Such models are then closely related to causal discovery in the presence of nonlinear confounders, which is a challenging problem. However, generally in such models the observation noise is assumed to be independent across data dimensions, and consequently the noise dependencies are ignored. In this paper we focus on the Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM), from which we develop an extended model called invariant GPLVM (IGPLVM), which can adapt to arbitrary noise covariances. With the Gaussian process prior put on a particular transformation of the latent nonlinear functions, instead of the original ones, the algorithm for IGPLVM involves almost the same computational loads as that for the original GPLVM. Besides its potential application in causal discovery, IGPLVM has the advantage that its estimated latent nonlinear manifold is invariant to any nonsingular linear transformation of the data. Experimental results on both synthetic and realworld data show its encouraging performance in nonlinear manifold learning and causal discovery.

1504.06701v1	The main contribution of this article is a new prior distribution over directed acyclic graphs, which gives larger weight to sparse graphs. This distribution is intended for structured Bayesian networks, where the structure is given by an ordered block model. That is, the nodes of the graph are objects which fall into categories (or blocks); the blocks have a natural ordering. The presence of a relationship between two objects is denoted by an arrow, from the object of lower category to the object of higher category. The models considered here were introduced in Kemp et al. (2004) for relational data and extended to multivariate data in Mansinghka et al. (2006). The prior over graph structures presented here has an explicit formula. The number of nodes in each layer of the graph follow a Hoppe Ewens urn model. We consider the situation where the nodes of the graph represent random variables, whose joint probability distribution factorises along the DAG. We describe Monte Carlo schemes for finding the optimal aposteriori structure given a data matrix and compare the performance with Mansinghka et al. (2006) and also with the uniform prior.

1204.1624v1	We introduce in this paper a new algorithm for Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems. A machine learning paradigm popular within Cognitive Network related topics (e.g., Spectrum Sensing and Allocation). We focus on the case where the rewards are exponentially distributed, which is common when dealing with Rayleigh fading channels. This strategy, named Multiplicative Upper Confidence Bound (MUCB), associates a utility index to every available arm, and then selects the arm with the highest index. For every arm, the associated index is equal to the product of a multiplicative factor by the sample mean of the rewards collected by this arm. We show that the MUCB policy has a low complexity and is order optimal.	UCB Algorithm for Exponential Distributions
1703.04864v2	We propose a data aggregation-based algorithm with monotonic convergence to a global optimum for a generalized version of the L1-norm error fitting model with an assumption of the fitting function. Any L1-norm model can be solved optimally using the proposed algorithm if it follows the form of the L1-norm error fitting problem and if the fitting function satisfies the assumption. The proposed algorithm can also solve multi-dimensional fitting problems with arbitrary constraints on the fitting coefficients matrix. The generalized problem includes popular models such as regression, principal component analysis, and the orthogonal Procrustes problem. The results of the computational experiment show that the proposed algorithms are up to 9,000 times faster than the state-of-the-art benchmarks for the problems and datasets studied.

1607.03842v1	An important problem in sequential decision-making under uncertainty is to use limited data to compute a safe policy, i.e., a policy that is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a given baseline strategy. In this paper, we develop and analyze a new model-based approach to compute a safe policy when we have access to an inaccurate dynamics model of the system with known accuracy guarantees. Our proposed robust method uses this (inaccurate) model to directly minimize the (negative) regret w.r.t. the baseline policy. Contrary to the existing approaches, minimizing the regret allows one to improve the baseline policy in states with accurate dynamics and seamlessly fall back to the baseline policy, otherwise. We show that our formulation is NP-hard and propose an approximate algorithm. Our empirical results on several domains show that even this relatively simple approximate algorithm can significantly outperform standard approaches.	Safe Policy Improvement by Minimizing Robust Baseline Regret
1709.05119v1	To model high dimensional data, Gaussian methods are widely used since they remain tractable and yield parsimonious models by imposing strong assumptions on the data. Vine copulas are more flexible by combining arbitrary marginal distributions and (conditional) bivariate copulas. Yet, this adaptability is accompanied by sharply increasing computational effort as the dimension increases. The approach proposed in this paper overcomes this burden and makes the first step into ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence modeling by using a divide-and-conquer approach. First, we apply Gaussian methods to split datasets into feasibly small subsets and second, apply parsimonious and flexible vine copulas thereon. Finally, we reconcile them into one joint model. We provide numerical results demonstrating the feasibility of our approach in moderate dimensions and showcase its ability to estimate ultra high dimensional non-Gaussian dependence models in thousands of dimensions.

1506.04088v2	Mean field variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation method due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, it is well known that a major failing of MFVB is that it underestimates the uncertainty of model variables (sometimes severely) and provides no information about model variable covariance. We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables---both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both simulated and real data.

1612.03409v2	This paper presents an algorithm for the unsupervised learning of latent variable models from unlabeled sets of data. We base our technique on spectral decomposition, providing a technique that proves to be robust both in theory and in practice. We also describe how to use this algorithm to learn the parameters of two well known text mining models: single topic model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, providing in both cases an efficient technique to retrieve the parameters to feed the algorithm. We compare the results of our algorithm with those of existing algorithms on synthetic data, and we provide examples of applications to real world text corpora for both single topic model and LDA, obtaining meaningful results.	A New Spectral Method for Latent Variable Models
1403.1481v1	The $k$-support norm is a regularizer which has been successfully applied to sparse vector prediction problems. We show that it belongs to a general class of norms which can be formulated as a parameterized infimum over quadratics. We further extend the $k$-support norm to matrices, and we observe that it is a special case of the matrix cluster norm. Using this formulation we derive an efficient algorithm to compute the proximity operator of both norms. This improves upon the standard algorithm for the $k$-support norm and allows us to apply proximal gradient methods to the cluster norm. We also describe how to solve regularization problems which employ centered versions of these norms. Finally, we apply the matrix regularizers to different matrix completion and multitask learning datasets. Our results indicate that the spectral $k$-support norm and the cluster norm give state of the art performance on these problems, significantly outperforming trace norm and elastic net penalties.	New Perspectives on k-Support and Cluster Norms
1309.6779v4	We consider the problem of learning causal directed acyclic graphs from an observational joint distribution. One can use these graphs to predict the outcome of interventional experiments, from which data are often not available. We show that if the observational distribution follows a structural equation model with an additive noise structure, the directed acyclic graph becomes identifiable from the distribution under mild conditions. This constitutes an interesting alternative to traditional methods that assume faithfulness and identify only the Markov equivalence class of the graph, thus leaving some edges undirected. We provide practical algorithms for finitely many samples, RESIT (Regression with Subsequent Independence Test) and two methods based on an independence score. We prove that RESIT is correct in the population setting and provide an empirical evaluation.	Causal Discovery with Continuous Additive Noise Models
1204.0991v2	Deregulation of energy markets, penetration of renewables, advanced metering capabilities, and the urge for situational awareness, all call for system-wide power system state estimation (PSSE). Implementing a centralized estimator though is practically infeasible due to the complexity scale of an interconnection, the communication bottleneck in real-time monitoring, regional disclosure policies, and reliability issues. In this context, distributed PSSE methods are treated here under a unified and systematic framework. A novel algorithm is developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It leverages existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies, exhibits low communication load, and its convergence to the centralized estimates is guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond the conventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodates a robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressive sampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the state and identifies corrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are numerically evaluated using the IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4,200-bus benchmarks. Simulations demonstrate that the attainable accuracy can be reached within a few inter-area exchanges, while largest residual tests are outperformed.	Distributed Robust Power System State Estimation
1703.01785v3	We study two procedures (reverse-mode and forward-mode) for computing the gradient of the validation error with respect to the hyperparameters of any iterative learning algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent. These procedures mirror two methods of computing gradients for recurrent neural networks and have different trade-offs in terms of running time and space requirements. Our formulation of the reverse-mode procedure is linked to previous work by Maclaurin et al. [2015] but does not require reversible dynamics. The forward-mode procedure is suitable for real-time hyperparameter updates, which may significantly speed up hyperparameter optimization on large datasets. We present experiments on data cleaning and on learning task interactions. We also present one large-scale experiment where the use of previous gradient-based methods would be prohibitive.	Forward and Reverse Gradient-Based Hyperparameter Optimization
1402.1412v2	In this tutorial we explain the inference procedures developed for the sparse Gaussian process (GP) regression and Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM). Due to page limit the derivation given in Titsias (2009) and Titsias & Lawrence (2010) is brief, hence getting a full picture of it requires collecting results from several different sources and a substantial amount of algebra to fill-in the gaps. Our main goal is thus to collect all the results and full derivations into one place to help speed up understanding this work. In doing so we present a re-parametrisation of the inference that allows it to be carried out in parallel. A secondary goal for this document is, therefore, to accompany our paper and open-source implementation of the parallel inference scheme for the models. We hope that this document will bridge the gap between the equations as implemented in code and those published in the original papers, in order to make it easier to extend existing work. We assume prior knowledge of Gaussian processes and variational inference, but we also include references for further reading where appropriate.

1610.03276v1	Extracting information from functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) images has been a major area of research for more than two decades. The goal of this work is to present a new method for the analysis of fMRI data sets, that is capable to incorporate a priori available information, via an efficient optimization framework. Tests on synthetic data sets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods of this kind.	Assisted Dictionary Learning for fMRI Data Analysis
1701.06508v2	Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified.	The Impact of Random Models on Clustering Similarity
1509.07497v2	"We briefly review recent progress in techniques for modeling and analyzing hyperspectral images and movies, in particular for detecting plumes of both known and unknown chemicals. For detecting chemicals of known spectrum, we extend the technique of using a single subspace for modeling the background to a ""mixture of subspaces"" model to tackle more complicated background. Furthermore, we use partial least squares regression on a resampled training set to boost performance. For the detection of unknown chemicals we view the problem as an anomaly detection problem, and use novel estimators with low-sampled complexity for intrinsically low-dimensional data in high-dimensions that enable us to model the ""normal"" spectra and detect anomalies. We apply these algorithms to benchmark data sets made available by the Automated Target Detection program co-funded by NSF, DTRA and NGA, and compare, when applicable, to current state-of-the-art algorithms, with favorable results."

1109.2397v2	Sparse estimation methods are aimed at using or obtaining parsimonious representations of data or models. While naturally cast as a combinatorial optimization problem, variable or feature selection admits a convex relaxation through the regularization by the $\ell_1$-norm. In this paper, we consider situations where we are not only interested in sparsity, but where some structural prior knowledge is available as well. We show that the $\ell_1$-norm can then be extended to structured norms built on either disjoint or overlapping groups of variables, leading to a flexible framework that can deal with various structures. We present applications to unsupervised learning, for structured sparse principal component analysis and hierarchical dictionary learning, and to supervised learning in the context of non-linear variable selection.	Structured sparsity through convex optimization
1305.1998v1	We propose an original model for inferring team strengths using a Markov Random Field, which can be used to generate historical estimates of the offensive and defensive strengths of a team over time. This model was designed to be applied to sports such as soccer or hockey, in which contest outcomes take value in a limited discrete space. We perform inference using a combination of Expectation Maximization and Loopy Belief Propagation. The challenges of working with a non-convex optimization problem and a high-dimensional parameter space are discussed. The performance of the model is demonstrated on professional soccer data from the English Premier League.	Inferring Team Strengths Using a Discrete Markov Random Field
1406.7130v4	In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy clustering algorithm based on the mode-seeking framework. Given a dataset in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we define regions of high density that we call cluster cores. We then consider a random walk on a neighborhood graph built on top of our data points which is designed to be attracted by high density regions. The strength of this attraction is controlled by a temperature parameter $\beta > 0$. The membership of a point to a given cluster is then the probability for the random walk to hit the corresponding cluster core before any other. While many properties of random walks (such as hitting times, commute distances, etc\dots) have been shown to enventually encode purely local information when the number of data points grows, we show that the regularization introduced by the use of cluster cores solves this issue. Empirically, we show how the choice of $\beta$ influences the behavior of our algorithm: for small values of $\beta$ the result is close to hard mode-seeking whereas when $\beta$ is close to $1$ the result is similar to the output of a (fuzzy) spectral clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by providing the fuzzy clustering of a protein configuration dataset containing a million data points in $30$ dimensions.	A Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm for the Mode Seeking Framework
1708.01529v1	We introduce a new algorithm for approximate inference that combines reparametrization, Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational methods. We construct a very flexible implicit variational distribution synthesized by an arbitrary Markov chain Monte Carlo operation and a deterministic transformation that can be optimized using the reparametrization trick. Unlike current methods for implicit variational inference, our method avoids the computation of log density ratios and therefore it is easily applicable to arbitrary continuous and differentiable models. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm for fitting banana-shaped distributions and for training variational autoencoders.	Learning Model Reparametrizations: Implicit Variational Inference by  Fitting MCMC distributions
1205.1240v1	In this paper, we propose an unifying view of several recently proposed structured sparsity-inducing norms. We consider the situation of a model simultaneously (a) penalized by a set- function de ned on the support of the unknown parameter vector which represents prior knowledge on supports, and (b) regularized in Lp-norm. We show that the natural combinatorial optimization problems obtained may be relaxed into convex optimization problems and introduce a notion, the lower combinatorial envelope of a set-function, that characterizes the tightness of our relaxations. We moreover establish links with norms based on latent representations including the latent group Lasso and block-coding, and with norms obtained from submodular functions.	Convex Relaxation for Combinatorial Penalties
1203.0786v1	Database theory and database practice are typically the domain of computer scientists who adopt what may be termed an algorithmic perspective on their data. This perspective is very different than the more statistical perspective adopted by statisticians, scientific computers, machine learners, and other who work on what may be broadly termed statistical data analysis. In this article, I will address fundamental aspects of this algorithmic-statistical disconnect, with an eye to bridging the gap between these two very different approaches. A concept that lies at the heart of this disconnect is that of statistical regularization, a notion that has to do with how robust is the output of an algorithm to the noise properties of the input data. Although it is nearly completely absent from computer science, which historically has taken the input data as given and modeled algorithms discretely, regularization in one form or another is central to nearly every application domain that applies algorithms to noisy data. By using several case studies, I will illustrate, both theoretically and empirically, the nonobvious fact that approximate computation, in and of itself, can implicitly lead to statistical regularization. This and other recent work suggests that, by exploiting in a more principled way the statistical properties implicit in worst-case algorithms, one can in many cases satisfy the bicriteria of having algorithms that are scalable to very large-scale databases and that also have good inferential or predictive properties.	Approximate Computation and Implicit Regularization for Very Large-scale  Data Analysis
1504.00722v2	We consider the problem of embedding unweighted, directed k-nearest neighbor graphs in low-dimensional Euclidean space. The k-nearest neighbors of each vertex provides ordinal information on the distances between points, but not the distances themselves. We use this ordinal information along with the low-dimensionality to recover the coordinates of the points up to arbitrary similarity transformations (rigid transformations and scaling). Furthermore, we also illustrate the possibility of robustly recovering the underlying density via the Total Variation Maximum Penalized Likelihood Estimation (TV-MPLE) method. We make existing approaches scalable by using an instance of a local-to-global algorithm based on group synchronization, recently proposed in the literature in the context of sensor network localization and structural biology, which we augment with a scaling synchronization step. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach on large graphs, and show how it compares to the Local Ordinal Embedding (LOE) algorithm, which was recently proposed for recovering the configuration of a cloud of points from pairwise ordinal comparisons between a sparse set of distances.

1602.05822v1	Sampling with replacement occurs in many settings in machine learning, notably in the bagging ensemble technique and the .632+ validation scheme. The number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample can have an important role in the behaviour of prediction models learned on it. Indeed, there are uncontrived examples where duplicate items have no effect. The purpose of this report is to present the distribution of the number of unique original items in a bootstrap sample clearly and concisely, with a view to enabling other machine learning researchers to understand and control this quantity in existing and future resampling techniques. We describe the key characteristics of this distribution along with the generalisation for the case where items come from distinct categories, as in classification. In both cases we discuss the normal limit, and conduct an empirical investigation to derive a heuristic for when a normal approximation is permissible.	What is the distribution of the number of unique original items in a  bootstrap sample?
1309.4859v1	We informally call a stochastic process learnable if it admits a generalization error approaching zero in probability for any concept class with finite VC-dimension (IID processes are the simplest example). A mixture of learnable processes need not be learnable itself, and certainly its generalization error need not decay at the same rate. In this paper, we argue that it is natural in predictive PAC to condition not on the past observations but on the mixture component of the sample path. This definition not only matches what a realistic learner might demand, but also allows us to sidestep several otherwise grave problems in learning from dependent data. In particular, we give a novel PAC generalization bound for mixtures of learnable processes with a generalization error that is not worse than that of each mixture component. We also provide a characterization of mixtures of absolutely regular ($\beta$-mixing) processes, of independent probability-theoretic interest.	Predictive PAC Learning and Process Decompositions
1711.10058v2	"In many problem settings, parameter vectors are not merely sparse, but dependent in such a way that non-zero coefficients tend to cluster together. We refer to this form of dependency as ""region sparsity"". Classical sparse regression methods, such as the lasso and automatic relevance determination (ARD), which model parameters as independent a priori, and therefore do not exploit such dependencies. Here we introduce a hierarchical model for smooth, region-sparse weight vectors and tensors in a linear regression setting. Our approach represents a hierarchical extension of the relevance determination framework, where we add a transformed Gaussian process to model the dependencies between the prior variances of regression weights. We combine this with a structured model of the prior variances of Fourier coefficients, which eliminates unnecessary high frequencies. The resulting prior encourages weights to be region-sparse in two different bases simultaneously. We develop Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to provide efficient inference for the posterior. Furthermore, a two-stage convex relaxation of the Laplace approximation approach is also provided to relax the inevitable non-convexity during the optimization. We finally show substantial improvements over comparable methods for both simulated and real datasets from brain imaging."

1604.03492v1	In recent years, structured matrix recovery problems have gained considerable attention for its real world applications, such as recommender systems and computer vision. Much of the existing work has focused on matrices with low-rank structure, and limited progress has been made matrices with other types of structure. In this paper we present non-asymptotic analysis for estimation of generally structured matrices via the generalized Dantzig selector under generic sub-Gaussian measurements. We show that the estimation error can always be succinctly expressed in terms of a few geometric measures of suitable sets which only depend on the structure of the underlying true matrix. In addition, we derive the general bounds on these geometric measures for structures characterized by unitarily invariant norms, which is a large family covering most matrix norms of practical interest. Examples are provided to illustrate the utility of our theoretical development.	Structured Matrix Recovery via the Generalized Dantzig Selector
1202.3725v1	Fisher score is one of the most widely used supervised feature selection methods. However, it selects each feature independently according to their scores under the Fisher criterion, which leads to a suboptimal subset of features. In this paper, we present a generalized Fisher score to jointly select features. It aims at finding an subset of features, which maximize the lower bound of traditional Fisher score. The resulting feature selection problem is a mixed integer programming, which can be reformulated as a quadratically constrained linear programming (QCLP). It is solved by cutting plane algorithm, in each iteration of which a multiple kernel learning problem is solved alternatively by multivariate ridge regression and projected gradient descent. Experiments on benchmark data sets indicate that the proposed method outperforms Fisher score as well as many other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.

1105.0760v1	We consider a binary unsupervised classification problem where each observation is associated with an unobserved label that we want to retrieve. More precisely, we assume that there are two groups of observation: normal and abnormal. The `normal' observations are coming from a known distribution whereas the distribution of the `abnormal' observations is unknown. Several models have been developed to fit this unknown distribution. In this paper, we propose an alternative based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The inference is done within a variational Bayesian framework and our aim is to infer the posterior probability of belonging to the class of interest. To this end, it makes no sense to estimate the mixture component number since each mixture model provides more or less relevant information to the posterior probability estimation. By computing a weighted average (named aggregated estimator) over the model collection, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is one way of combining models in order to account for information provided by each model. The aim is then the estimation of the weights and the posterior probability for one specific model. In this work, we derive optimal approximations of these quantities from the variational theory and propose other approximations of the weights. To perform our method, we consider that the data are dependent (Markovian dependency) and hence we consider a Hidden Markov Model. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the estimates in terms of classification. We also present an application to the analysis of public health surveillance systems.

1705.07857v1	In this work we develop a fast saliency detection method that can be applied to any differentiable image classifier. We train a masking model to manipulate the scores of the classifier by masking salient parts of the input image. Our model generalises well to unseen images and requires a single forward pass to perform saliency detection, therefore suitable for use in real-time systems. We test our approach on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets and show that the produced saliency maps are easily interpretable, sharp, and free of artifacts. We suggest a new metric for saliency and test our method on the ImageNet object localisation task. We achieve results outperforming other weakly supervised methods.

1703.04046v2	The present study proposes a deep learning model, named DeepSleepNet, for automatic sleep stage scoring based on raw single-channel EEG. Most of the existing methods rely on hand-engineered features which require prior knowledge of sleep analysis. Only a few of them encode the temporal information such as transition rules, which is important for identifying the next sleep stages, into the extracted features. In the proposed model, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks to extract time-invariant features, and bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory to learn transition rules among sleep stages automatically from EEG epochs. We implement a two-step training algorithm to train our model efficiently. We evaluated our model using different single-channel EEGs (F4-EOG(Left), Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz) from two public sleep datasets, that have different properties (e.g., sampling rate) and scoring standards (AASM and R&K). The results showed that our model achieved similar overall accuracy and macro F1-score (MASS: 86.2%-81.7, Sleep-EDF: 82.0%-76.9) compared to the state-of-the-art methods (MASS: 85.9%-80.5, Sleep-EDF: 78.9%-73.7) on both datasets. This demonstrated that, without changing the model architecture and the training algorithm, our model could automatically learn features for sleep stage scoring from different raw single-channel EEGs from different datasets without utilizing any hand-engineered features.

1610.09034v1	We propose a geometric algorithm for topic learning and inference that is built on the convex geometry of topics arising from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and its nonparametric extensions. To this end we study the optimization of a geometric loss function, which is a surrogate to the LDA's likelihood. Our method involves a fast optimization based weighted clustering procedure augmented with geometric corrections, which overcomes the computational and statistical inefficiencies encountered by other techniques based on Gibbs sampling and variational inference, while achieving the accuracy comparable to that of a Gibbs sampler. The topic estimates produced by our method are shown to be statistically consistent under some conditions. The algorithm is evaluated with extensive experiments on simulated and real data.

1105.0828v2	Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a nonparametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously. We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple data sets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in data sets including different types of variables. In our comparative study missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and nonlinear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data.	MissForest - nonparametric missing value imputation for mixed-type data
1210.5345v1	We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a differentiable function given a finite number of evaluations to the function. We construct a sampling scheme that samples more often in regions where the function oscillates more, while allocating the samples such that they are well spread on the domain (this notion shares similitude with low discrepancy). We prove that the estimate returned by the algorithm is almost similarly accurate as the estimate that an optimal oracle strategy (that would know the variations of the function everywhere) would return, and provide a finite-sample analysis.

1702.01145v1	A common problem in disciplines of applied Statistics research such as Astrostatistics is of estimating the posterior distribution of relevant parameters. Typically, the likelihoods for such models are computed via expensive experiments such as cosmological simulations of the universe. An urgent challenge in these research domains is to develop methods that can estimate the posterior with few likelihood evaluations. In this paper, we study active posterior estimation in a Bayesian setting when the likelihood is expensive to evaluate. Existing techniques for posterior estimation are based on generating samples representative of the posterior. Such methods do not consider efficiency in terms of likelihood evaluations. In order to be query efficient we treat posterior estimation in an active regression framework. We propose two myopic query strategies to choose where to evaluate the likelihood and implement them using Gaussian processes. Via experiments on a series of synthetic and real examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more query efficient than existing techniques and other heuristics for posterior estimation.

We show that for any continuous function $f$, consistent estimators of the mean embedding of a random variable $X$ lead to consistent estimators of the mean embedding of $f(X)$. For Mat\'ern kernels and sufficiently smooth functions we also provide rates of convergence. Our results extend to functions of multiple random variables. If the variables are dependent, we require an estimator of the mean embedding of their joint distribution as a starting point; if they are independent, it is sufficient to have separate estimators of the mean embeddings of their marginal distributions. In either case, our results cover both mean embeddings based on i.i.d. samples as well as ""reduced set"" expansions in terms of dependent expansion points. The latter serves as a justification for using such expansions to limit memory resources when applying the approach as a basis for probabilistic programming."

1610.03425v2	We study statistical inference and robust solution methods for stochastic optimization problems, focusing on giving calibrated and adaptive confidence intervals for optimal values and solutions for a range of stochastic problems. As part of this, we develop a generalized empirical likelihood framework---based on distributional uncertainty sets constructed from nonparametric $f$-divergence balls---for Hadamard differentiable functionals, and in particular, stochastic optimization problems. As consequences of this theory, we provide principled methods of choosing distributional uncertainty regions so as to provide calibrated one- and two-sided confidence intervals. We also give an asymptotic expansion for our distributionally robust formulation, showing how robustification regularizes problems by their variance. Finally, we show that optimizers of the distributionally robust formulations we study enjoy (essentially) the same consistency properties as those in classical sample average approximations.

1309.1233v2	This paper considers the problem of subspace clustering under noise. Specifically, we study the behavior of Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) when either adversarial or random noise is added to the unlabelled input data points, which are assumed to be in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. We show that a modified version of SSC is \emph{provably effective} in correctly identifying the underlying subspaces, even with noisy data. This extends theoretical guarantee of this algorithm to more practical settings and provides justification to the success of SSC in a class of real applications.	Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering
1312.7604v2	Archetypal analysis represents a set of observations as convex combinations of pure patterns, or archetypes. The original geometric formulation of finding archetypes by approximating the convex hull of the observations assumes them to be real valued. This, unfortunately, is not compatible with many practical situations. In this paper we revisit archetypal analysis from the basic principles, and propose a probabilistic framework that accommodates other observation types such as integers, binary, and probability vectors. We corroborate the proposed methodology with convincing real-world applications on finding archetypal winter tourists based on binary survey data, archetypal disaster-affected countries based on disaster count data, and document archetypes based on term-frequency data. We also present an appropriate visualization tool to summarize archetypal analysis solution better.	Probabilistic Archetypal Analysis
1702.08848v3	We propose a novel method for semi-supervised learning (SSL) based on data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DRO) using optimal transport metrics. Our proposed method enhances generalization error by using the unlabeled data to restrict the support of the worst case distribution in our DRO formulation. We enable the implementation of our DRO formulation by proposing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm which allows to easily implement the training procedure. We demonstrate that our Semi-supervised DRO method is able to improve the generalization error over natural supervised procedures and state-of-the-art SSL estimators. Finally, we include a discussion on the large sample behavior of the optimal uncertainty region in the DRO formulation. Our discussion exposes important aspects such as the role of dimension reduction in SSL.	Semi-supervised Learning based on Distributionally Robust Optimization
1501.00604v1	Big data comes in various ways, types, shapes, forms and sizes. Indeed, almost all areas of science, technology, medicine, public health, economics, business, linguistics and social science are bombarded by ever increasing flows of data begging to analyzed efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we propose a rough idea of a possible taxonomy of big data, along with some of the most commonly used tools for handling each particular category of bigness. The dimensionality p of the input space and the sample size n are usually the main ingredients in the characterization of data bigness. The specific statistical machine learning technique used to handle a particular big data set will depend on which category it falls in within the bigness taxonomy. Large p small n data sets for instance require a different set of tools from the large n small p variety. Among other tools, we discuss Preprocessing, Standardization, Imputation, Projection, Regularization, Penalization, Compression, Reduction, Selection, Kernelization, Hybridization, Parallelization, Aggregation, Randomization, Replication, Sequentialization. Indeed, it is important to emphasize right away that the so-called no free lunch theorem applies here, in the sense that there is no universally superior method that outperforms all other methods on all categories of bigness. It is also important to stress the fact that simplicity in the sense of Ockham's razor non plurality principle of parsimony tends to reign supreme when it comes to massive data. We conclude with a comparison of the predictive performance of some of the most commonly used methods on a few data sets.

1507.00543v1	This paper compares classical parametric methods with recently developed Bayesian methods for system identification. A Full Bayes solution is considered together with one of the standard approximations based on the Empirical Bayes paradigm. Results regarding point estimators for the impulse response as well as for confidence regions are reported.

1205.1496v2	Graph construction is a crucial step in spectral clustering (SC) and graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL). Spectral methods applied on standard graphs such as full-RBF, $\epsilon$-graphs and $k$-NN graphs can lead to poor performance in the presence of proximal and unbalanced data. This is because spectral methods based on minimizing RatioCut or normalized cut on these graphs tend to put more importance on balancing cluster sizes over reducing cut values. We propose a novel graph construction technique and show that the RatioCut solution on this new graph is able to handle proximal and unbalanced data. Our method is based on adaptively modulating the neighborhood degrees in a $k$-NN graph, which tends to sparsify neighborhoods in low density regions. Our method adapts to data with varying levels of unbalancedness and can be naturally used for small cluster detection. We justify our ideas through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method.	Graph-based Learning with Unbalanced Clusters
1604.02181v6	We study the sparse non-negative least squares (S-NNLS) problem. S-NNLS occurs naturally in a wide variety of applications where an unknown, non-negative quantity must be recovered from linear measurements. We present a unified framework for S-NNLS based on a rectified power exponential scale mixture prior on the sparse codes. We show that the proposed framework encompasses a large class of S-NNLS algorithms and provide a computationally efficient inference procedure based on multiplicative update rules. Such update rules are convenient for solving large sets of S-NNLS problems simultaneously, which is required in contexts like sparse non-negative matrix factorization (S-NMF). We provide theoretical justification for the proposed approach by showing that the local minima of the objective function being optimized are sparse and the S-NNLS algorithms presented are guaranteed to converge to a set of stationary points of the objective function. We then extend our framework to S-NMF, showing that our framework leads to many well known S-NMF algorithms under specific choices of prior and providing a guarantee that a popular subclass of the proposed algorithms converges to a set of stationary points of the objective function. Finally, we study the performance of the proposed approaches on synthetic and real-world data.

1311.0360v1	We propose a family of multivariate Gaussian process models for correlated outputs, based on assuming that the likelihood function takes the generic form of the multivariate exponential family distribution (EFD). We denote this model as a multivariate generalized Gaussian process model, and derive Taylor and Laplace algorithms for approximate inference on the generic model. By instantiating the EFD with specific parameter functions, we obtain two novel GP models (and corresponding inference algorithms) for correlated outputs: 1) a Von-Mises GP for angle regression; and 2) a Dirichlet GP for regressing on the multinomial simplex.

1502.03696v7	Reciprocating interactions represent a central feature of all human exchanges. They have been the target of various recent experiments, with healthy participants and psychiatric populations engaging as dyads in multi-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behaviour in such exchanges involves complexities related to each agent's preference for equity with their partner, beliefs about the partner's appetite for equity, beliefs about the partner's model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise account of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what underlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various complexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert observations of behavioural choices. We use generated behaviour to elucidate the richness and sophistication of interactive inference.	Monte Carlo Planning method estimates planning horizons during  interactive social exchange
1707.06792v2	In this study, we present a multi-class graphical Bayesian predictive classifier that incorporates the uncertainty in the model selection into the standard Bayesian formalism. For each class, the dependence structure underlying the observed features is represented by a set of decomposable Gaussian graphical models. Emphasis is then placed on the Bayesian model averaging which takes full account of the class-specific model uncertainty by averaging over the posterior graph model probabilities. Even though the decomposability assumption severely reduces the model space, the size of the class of decomposable models is still immense, rendering the explicit Bayesian averaging over all the models infeasible. To address this issue, we consider the particle Gibbs strategy of Olsson et al. (2016) for posterior sampling from decomposable graphical models which utilizes the Christmas tree algorithm of Rios et al. (2016) as proposal kernel. We also derive the a strong hyper Markov law which we call the hyper normal Wishart law that allow to perform the resultant Bayesian calculations locally. The proposed predictive graphical classifier reveals superior performance compared to the ordinary Bayesian predictive rule that does not account for the model uncertainty, as well as to a number of out-of-the-box classifiers.

1512.05469v2	"Causal inference deals with identifying which random variables ""cause"" or control other random variables. Recent advances on the topic of causal inference based on tools from statistical estimation and machine learning have resulted in practical algorithms for causal inference. Causal inference has the potential to have significant impact on medical research, prevention and control of diseases, and identifying factors that impact economic changes to name just a few. However, these promising applications for causal inference are often ones that involve sensitive or personal data of users that need to be kept private (e.g., medical records, personal finances, etc). Therefore, there is a need for the development of causal inference methods that preserve data privacy. We study the problem of inferring causality using the current, popular causal inference framework, the additive noise model (ANM) while simultaneously ensuring privacy of the users. Our framework provides differential privacy guarantees for a variety of ANM variants. We run extensive experiments, and demonstrate that our techniques are practical and easy to implement."

0804.2848v1	Flow cytometry is often used to characterize the malignant cells in leukemia and lymphoma patients, traced to the level of the individual cell. Typically, flow cytometric data analysis is performed through a series of 2-dimensional projections onto the axes of the data set. Through the years, clinicians have determined combinations of different fluorescent markers which generate relatively known expression patterns for specific subtypes of leukemia and lymphoma -- cancers of the hematopoietic system. By only viewing a series of 2-dimensional projections, the high-dimensional nature of the data is rarely exploited. In this paper we present a means of determining a low-dimensional projection which maintains the high-dimensional relationships (i.e. information) between differing oncological data sets. By using machine learning techniques, we allow clinicians to visualize data in a low dimension defined by a linear combination of all of the available markers, rather than just 2 at a time. This provides an aid in diagnosing similar forms of cancer, as well as a means for variable selection in exploratory flow cytometric research. We refer to our method as Information Preserving Component Analysis (IPCA).	Information Preserving Component Analysis: Data Projections for Flow  Cytometry Analysis
1703.01973v2	Optimization of high-dimensional black-box functions is an extremely challenging problem. While Bayesian optimization has emerged as a popular approach for optimizing black-box functions, its applicability has been limited to low-dimensional problems due to its computational and statistical challenges arising from high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose to tackle these challenges by (1) assuming a latent additive structure in the function and inferring it properly for more efficient and effective BO, and (2) performing multiple evaluations in parallel to reduce the number of iterations required by the method. Our novel approach learns the latent structure with Gibbs sampling and constructs batched queries using determinantal point processes. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world functions demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.

1408.5404v2	A wild bootstrap method for nonparametric hypothesis tests based on kernel distribution embeddings is proposed. This bootstrap method is used to construct provably consistent tests that apply to random processes, for which the naive permutation-based bootstrap fails. It applies to a large group of kernel tests based on V-statistics, which are degenerate under the null hypothesis, and non-degenerate elsewhere. To illustrate this approach, we construct a two-sample test, an instantaneous independence test and a multiple lag independence test for time series. In experiments, the wild bootstrap gives strong performance on synthetic examples, on audio data, and in performance benchmarking for the Gibbs sampler.	A Wild Bootstrap for Degenerate Kernel Tests
1608.08362v1	An incremental/online state dynamic learning method is proposed for identification of the nonlinear Gaussian state space models. The method embeds the stochastic variational sparse Gaussian process as the probabilistic state dynamic model inside a particle filter framework. Model updating is done at measurement sample rate using stochastic gradient descent based optimization implemented in the state estimation filtering loop. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian process based batch learning methods. Finally, it is shown that the state estimation performance significantly improves due to the online learning of state dynamics.

1205.2626v1	Recently it has become popular to learn sparse Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) by imposing l1 or group l1,2 penalties on the elements of the precision matrix. Thispenalized likelihood approach results in a tractable convex optimization problem. In this paper, we reinterpret these results as performing MAP estimation under a novel prior which we call the group l1 and l1,2 positivedefinite matrix distributions. This enables us to build a hierarchical model in which the l1 regularization terms vary depending on which group the entries are assigned to, which in turn allows us to learn block structured sparse GGMs with unknown group assignments. Exact inference in this hierarchical model is intractable, due to the need to compute the normalization constant of these matrix distributions. However, we derive upper bounds on the partition functions, which lets us use fast variational inference (optimizing a lower bound on the joint posterior). We show that on two real world data sets (motion capture and financial data), our method which infers the block structure outperforms a method that uses a fixed block structure, which in turn outperforms baseline methods that ignore block structure.	Group Sparse Priors for Covariance Estimation
1110.1880v1	In Bayesian statistics, many problems can be expressed as the evaluation of the expectation of a quantity of interest with respect to the posterior distribution. Standard Monte Carlo method is often not applicable because the encountered posterior distributions cannot be sampled directly. In this case, the most popular strategies are the importance sampling method, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and annealing. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for Bayesian inference, called Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling (AIMS), which is based on the above methods. We derive important ergodic properties of AIMS. In particular, it is shown that, under certain conditions, the AIMS algorithm produces a uniformly ergodic Markov chain. The choice of the free parameters of the algorithm is discussed and recommendations are provided for this choice, both theoretically and heuristically based. The efficiency of AIMS is demonstrated with three numerical examples, which include both multi-modal and higher-dimensional target posterior distributions.

1205.1181v1	Inferring the structure of gene regulatory networks (GRN) from gene expression data has many applications, from the elucidation of complex biological processes to the identification of potential drug targets. It is however a notoriously difficult problem, for which the many existing methods reach limited accuracy. In this paper, we formulate GRN inference as a sparse regression problem and investigate the performance of a popular feature selection method, least angle regression (LARS) combined with stability selection. We introduce a novel, robust and accurate scoring technique for stability selection, which improves the performance of feature selection with LARS. The resulting method, which we call TIGRESS (Trustful Inference of Gene REgulation using Stability Selection), was ranked among the top methods in the DREAM5 gene network reconstruction challenge. We investigate in depth the influence of the various parameters of the method and show that a fine parameter tuning can lead to significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance for GRN inference. TIGRESS reaches state-of-the-art performance on benchmark data. This study confirms the potential of feature selection techniques for GRN inference.

1001.0160v2	Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets.

1705.00461v1	The paper addresses the simultneous determination of goup-sparse loadings by block optimization, and the correlated problem of defining explained variance for a set of non orthogonal components. We give in both cases a comprehensive mathematical presentation of the problem, which leads to propose i) a new formulation/algorithm for group-sparse block PCA and ii) a framework for the definition of explained variance with the analysis of five definitions. The numerical results i) confirm the superiority of block optimization over deflation for the determination of group-sparse loadings, and the importance of group information when available, and ii) show that ranking of algorithms according to explained variance is essentially independant of the definition of explained variance. These results lead to propose a new optimal variance as the definition of choice for explained variance.	Group-sparse block PCA and explained variance
1502.02347v2	This paper proposes a unified framework to quantify local and global inferential uncertainty for high dimensional nonparanormal graphical models. In particular, we consider the problems of testing the presence of a single edge and constructing a uniform confidence subgraph. Due to the presence of unknown marginal transformations, we propose a pseudo likelihood based inferential approach. In sharp contrast to the existing high dimensional score test method, our method is free of tuning parameters given an initial estimator, and extends the scope of the existing likelihood based inferential framework. Furthermore, we propose a U-statistic multiplier bootstrap method to construct the confidence subgraph. We show that the constructed subgraph is contained in the true graph with probability greater than a given nominal level. Compared with existing methods for constructing confidence subgraphs, our method does not rely on Gaussian or sub-Gaussian assumptions. The theoretical properties of the proposed inferential methods are verified by thorough numerical experiments and real data analysis.

1711.11279v2	"Neural networks commonly offer high utility but remain difficult to interpret. Developing methods to explain their decisions is challenging due to their large size, complex structure, and inscrutable internal representations. This work argues that the language of explanations should be expanded from that of input features (e.g., assigning importance weightings to pixels) to include that of higher-level, human-friendly concepts. For example, an understandable explanation of why an image classifier outputs the label ""zebra"" would ideally relate to concepts such as ""stripes"" rather than a set of particular pixel values. This paper introduces the ""concept activation vector"" (CAV) which allows quantitative analysis of a concept's relative importance to classification, with a user-provided set of input data examples defining the concept. CAVs may be easily used by non-experts, who need only provide examples, and with CAVs the high-dimensional structure of neural networks turns into an aid to interpretation, rather than an obstacle. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to test hypotheses about classifiers and also generate insights into the deficiencies and correlations in training data. CAVs also provide us a directed approach to choose the combinations of neurons to visualize with the DeepDream technique, which traditionally has chosen neurons or linear combinations of neurons at random to visualize."

1203.3475v1	We consider two variables that are related to each other by an invertible function. While it has previously been shown that the dependence structure of the noise can provide hints to determine which of the two variables is the cause, we presently show that even in the deterministic (noise-free) case, there are asymmetries that can be exploited for causal inference. Our method is based on the idea that if the function and the probability density of the cause are chosen independently, then the distribution of the effect will, in a certain sense, depend on the function. We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, showing that it also works in the low noise regime, and link it to information geometry. We report strong empirical results on various real-world data sets from different domains.	Inferring deterministic causal relations
1203.1828v1	We present an alternating augmented Lagrangian method for convex optimization problems where the cost function is the sum of two terms, one that is separable in the variable blocks, and a second that is separable in the difference between consecutive variable blocks. Examples of such problems include Fused Lasso estimation, total variation denoising, and multi-period portfolio optimization with transaction costs. In each iteration of our method, the first step involves separately optimizing over each variable block, which can be carried out in parallel. The second step is not separable in the variables, but can be carried out very efficiently. We apply the algorithm to segmentation of data based on changes inmean (l_1 mean filtering) or changes in variance (l_1 variance filtering). In a numerical example, we show that our implementation is around 10000 times faster compared with the generic optimization solver SDPT3.

1003.3829v1	Many complex dynamical phenomena can be effectively modeled by a system that switches among a set of conditionally linear dynamical modes. We consider two such models: the switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and the switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Our Bayesian nonparametric approach utilizes a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn an unknown number of persistent, smooth dynamical modes. We additionally employ automatic relevance determination to infer a sparse set of dynamic dependencies allowing us to learn SLDS with varying state dimension or switching VAR processes with varying autoregressive order. We develop a sampling algorithm that combines a truncated approximation to the Dirichlet process with efficient joint sampling of the mode and state sequences. The utility and flexibility of our model are demonstrated on synthetic data, sequences of dancing honey bees, the IBOVESPA stock index, and a maneuvering target tracking application.

1802.08139v1	We consider the problem of learning fair decision systems in complex scenarios in which a sensitive attribute might affect the decision along both fair and unfair pathways. We introduce a causal approach to disregard effects along unfair pathways that simplifies and generalizes previous literature. Our method corrects observations adversely affected by the sensitive attribute, and uses these to form a decision. This avoids disregarding fair information, and does not require an often intractable computation of the path-specific effect. We leverage recent developments in deep learning and approximate inference to achieve a solution that is widely applicable to complex, non-linear scenarios.	Path-Specific Counterfactual Fairness
1605.00513v1	Distributional (or distribution-valued) data are a new type of data arising from several sources and are considered as realizations of distributional variables. A new set of fuzzy c-means algorithms for data described by distributional variables is proposed. The algorithms use the $L2$ Wasserstein distance between distributions as dissimilarity measures. Beside the extension of the fuzzy c-means algorithm for distributional data, and considering a decomposition of the squared $L2$ Wasserstein distance, we propose a set of algorithms using different automatic way to compute the weights associated with the variables as well as with their components, globally or cluster-wise. The relevance weights are computed in the clustering process introducing product-to-one constraints. The relevance weights induce adaptive distances expressing the importance of each variable or of each component in the clustering process, acting also as a variable selection method in clustering. We have tested the proposed algorithms on artificial and real-world data. Results confirm that the proposed methods are able to better take into account the cluster structure of the data with respect to the standard fuzzy c-means, with non-adaptive distances.

1711.11511v2	In this paper, we propose a new sampling method named as the thermostat-assisted continuous-tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for multimodal posterior sampling on large datasets. It simulates a noisy system, which is augmented by a coupling tempering variable as well as a set of Nos\'e-Hoover thermostats. This augmentation is devised to address two main issues of concern: the first is to effectively generate i.i.d. samples from complex multimodal posterior distributions; the second is to adaptively control the system dynamics in the presence of unknown noise that arises from the use of mini-batches. The experiment on synthetic distributions has been performed; the result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

1402.4507v1	We propose a new high dimensional semiparametric principal component analysis (PCA) method, named Copula Component Analysis (COCA). The semiparametric model assumes that, after unspecified marginally monotone transformations, the distributions are multivariate Gaussian. COCA improves upon PCA and sparse PCA in three aspects: (i) It is robust to modeling assumptions; (ii) It is robust to outliers and data contamination; (iii) It is scale-invariant and yields more interpretable results. We prove that the COCA estimators obtain fast estimation rates and are feature selection consistent when the dimension is nearly exponentially large relative to the sample size. Careful experiments confirm that COCA outperforms sparse PCA on both synthetic and real-world datasets.	High Dimensional Semiparametric Scale-Invariant Principal Component  Analysis

1011.1373v1	Lasso and other regularization procedures are attractive methods for variable selection, subject to a proper choice of shrinkage parameter. Given a set of potential subsets produced by a regularization algorithm, a consistent model selection criterion is proposed to select the best one among this preselected set. The approach leads to a fast and efficient procedure for variable selection, especially in high-dimensional settings. Model selection consistency of the suggested criterion is proven when the number of covariates d is fixed. Simulation studies suggest that the criterion still enjoys model selection consistency when d is much larger than the sample size. The simulations also show that our approach for variable selection works surprisingly well in comparison with existing competitors. The method is also applied to a real data set.

1704.04812v2	We show that k-means (Lloyd's algorithm) is equivalent to a variational EM approximation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with isotropic Gaussians. The k-means algorithm is obtained if truncated posteriors are used as variational distributions. In contrast to the standard way to relate k-means and GMMs, we show that it is not required to consider the limit case of Gaussians with zero variance. There are a number of consequences following from our observation: (A) k-means can be shown to monotonously increase the free-energy associated with truncated distributions; (B) Using the free-energy, we can derive an explicit and compact formula of a lower GMM likelihood bound which uses the k-means objective as argument; (C) We can generalize k-means using truncated variational EM, and relate such generalizations to other k-means-like algorithms. In general, truncated variational EM provides a natural and quantitative link between k-means-like clustering and GMM clustering algorithms which may be very relevant for future theoretical as well as empirical studies.	k-Means is a Variational EM Approximation of Gaussian Mixture Models

Observed pairs are assumed to be generated by a simple popularity based selection process followed by censoring using a preference function. By basing inference on the well-founded principle of variational bounding, and using new site-independent bounds, we show how a scalable inference procedure can be obtained for large data sets. State of the art results are presented on real-world movie viewing data.	Scalable Bayesian Modelling of Paired Symbols
1602.06235v1	Many machine learning problems can be characterized by mutual contamination models. In these problems, one observes several random samples from different convex combinations of a set of unknown base distributions. It is of interest to decontaminate mutual contamination models, i.e., to recover the base distributions either exactly or up to a permutation. This paper considers the general setting where the base distributions are defined on arbitrary probability spaces. We examine the decontamination problem in two mutual contamination models that describe popular machine learning tasks: recovering the base distributions up to a permutation in a mixed membership model, and recovering the base distributions exactly in a partial label model for classification. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability of both mutual contamination models, algorithms for both problems in the infinite and finite sample cases, and introduce novel proof techniques based on affine geometry.

This series expansion is shown to be useful for numerical calculations of the JSD, when the probability distributions are nearly equal, and for which, consequently, small numerical errors dominate evaluation.

0910.4135v1	The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle states that the optimal model for a given data set is that which compresses it best. Due to practial limitations the model can be restricted to a class such as linear regression models, which we address in this study. As in other formulations such as the LASSO and forward step-wise regression we are interested in sparsifying the feature set while preserving generalization ability. We derive a well-principled set of codes for both parameters and error residuals along with smooth approximations to lengths of these codes as to allow gradient descent optimization of description length, and go on to show that sparsification and feature selection using our approach is faster than the LASSO on several datasets from the UCI and StatLib repositories, with favorable generalization accuracy, while being fully automatic, requiring neither cross-validation nor tuning of regularization hyper-parameters, allowing even for a nonlinear expansion of the feature set followed by sparsification.

1707.06611v3	The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has delivered valuable sensing of surface soil moisture since 2015. However, it has a short time span and irregular revisit schedule. Utilizing a state-of-the-art time-series deep learning neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), we created a system that predicts SMAP level-3 soil moisture data with atmospheric forcing, model-simulated moisture, and static physiographic attributes as inputs. The system removes most of the bias with model simulations and improves predicted moisture climatology, achieving small test root-mean-squared error (<0.035) and high correlation coefficient >0.87 for over 75\% of Continental United States, including the forested Southeast. As the first application of LSTM in hydrology, we show the proposed network avoids overfitting and is robust for both temporal and spatial extrapolation tests. LSTM generalizes well across regions with distinct climates and physiography. With high fidelity to SMAP, LSTM shows great potential for hindcasting, data assimilation, and weather forecasting.

1201.3382v2	We consider the problem of using a factor model we call {\em spike-and-slab sparse coding} (S3C) to learn features for a classification task. The S3C model resembles both the spike-and-slab RBM and sparse coding. Since exact inference in this model is intractable, we derive a structured variational inference procedure and employ a variational EM training algorithm. Prior work on approximate inference for this model has not prioritized the ability to exploit parallel architectures and scale to enormous problem sizes. We present an inference procedure appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent factors. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning capabilities of both sparse coding and the ssRBM on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We evaluate our approach's potential for semi-supervised learning on subsets of CIFAR-10. We demonstrate state-of-the art self-taught learning performance on the STL-10 dataset and use our method to win the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Challenges In Learning Hierarchical Models' Transfer Learning Challenge.

1509.02116v3	Large sample size brings the computation bottleneck for modern data analysis. Subsampling is one of efficient strategies to handle this problem. In previous studies, researchers make more fo- cus on subsampling with replacement (SSR) than on subsampling without replacement (SSWR). In this paper we investigate a kind of SSWR, poisson subsampling (PSS), for fast algorithm in ordinary least-square problem. We establish non-asymptotic property, i.e, the error bound of the correspond- ing subsample estimator, which provide a tradeoff between computation cost and approximation efficiency. Besides the non-asymptotic result, we provide asymptotic consistency and normality of the subsample estimator. Methodologically, we propose a two-step subsampling algorithm, which is efficient with respect to a statistical objective and independent on the linear model assumption.. Synthetic and real data are used to empirically study our proposed subsampling strategies. We argue by these empirical studies that, (1) our proposed two-step algorithm has obvious advantage when the assumed linear model does not accurate, and (2) the PSS strategy performs obviously better than SSR when the subsampling ratio increases.	Poisson Subsampling Algorithms for Large Sample Linear Regression in  Massive Data
1501.02218v1	"In certain situations that shall be undoubtedly more and more common in the Big Data era, the datasets available are so massive that computing statistics over the full sample is hardly feasible, if not unfeasible. A natural approach in this context consists in using survey schemes and substituting the ""full data"" statistics with their counterparts based on the resulting random samples, of manageable size. It is the main purpose of this paper to investigate the impact of survey sampling with unequal inclusion probabilities on stochastic gradient descent-based M-estimation methods in large-scale statistical and machine-learning problems. Precisely, we prove that, in presence of some a priori information, one may significantly increase asymptotic accuracy when choosing appropriate first order inclusion probabilities, without affecting complexity. These striking results are described here by limit theorems and are also illustrated by numerical experiments."	Survey schemes for stochastic gradient descent with applications to  M-estimation
1709.07175v1	Stochastic principal component analysis (SPCA) has become a popular dimensionality reduction strategy for large, high-dimensional datasets. We derive a simplified algorithm, called Lazy SPCA, which has reduced computational complexity and is better suited for large-scale distributed computation. We prove that SPCA and Lazy SPCA find the same approximations to the principal subspace, and that the pairwise distances between samples in the lower-dimensional space is invariant to whether SPCA is executed lazily or not. Empirical studies find downstream predictive performance to be identical for both methods, and superior to random projections, across a range of predictive models (linear regression, logistic lasso, and random forests). In our largest experiment with 4.6 million samples, Lazy SPCA reduced 43.7 hours of computation to 9.9 hours. Overall, Lazy SPCA relies exclusively on matrix multiplications, besides an operation on a small square matrix whose size depends only on the target dimensionality.

1602.05221v2	Datasets are growing not just in size but in complexity, creating a demand for rich models and quantification of uncertainty. Bayesian methods are an excellent fit for this demand, but scaling Bayesian inference is a challenge. In response to this challenge, there has been considerable recent work based on varying assumptions about model structure, underlying computational resources, and the importance of asymptotic correctness. As a result, there is a zoo of ideas with few clear overarching principles. In this paper, we seek to identify unifying principles, patterns, and intuitions for scaling Bayesian inference. We review existing work on utilizing modern computing resources with both MCMC and variational approximation techniques. From this taxonomy of ideas, we characterize the general principles that have proven successful for designing scalable inference procedures and comment on the path forward.	Patterns of Scalable Bayesian Inference
1106.0474v1	We propose a restricted collapsed draw (RCD) sampler, a general Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler of simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Chinese restaurant process (HCRP) with restriction. Models that require simultaneous draws from a hierarchical Dirichlet process with restriction, such as infinite Hidden markov models (iHMM), were difficult to enjoy benefits of \markerg{the} HCRP due to combinatorial explosion in calculating distributions of coupled draws. By constructing a proposal of seating arrangements (partitioning) and stochastically accepts the proposal by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the RCD sampler makes accurate sampling for complex combination of draws while retaining efficiency of HCRP representation. Based on the RCD sampler, we developed a series of sophisticated sampling algorithms for iHMMs, including blocked Gibbs sampling, beam sampling, and split-merge sampling, that outperformed conventional iHMM samplers in experiments	Restricted Collapsed Draw: Accurate Sampling for Hierarchical Chinese  Restaurant Process Hidden Markov Models
0803.1628v1	Being among the easiest ways to find meaningful structure from discrete data, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and related component models have been applied widely. They are simple, computationally fast and scalable, interpretable, and admit nonparametric priors. In the currently popular field of network modeling, relatively little work has taken uncertainty of data seriously in the Bayesian sense, and component models have been introduced to the field only recently, by treating each node as a bag of out-going links. We introduce an alternative, interaction component model for communities (ICMc), where the whole network is a bag of links, stemming from different components. The former finds both disassortative and assortative structure, while the alternative assumes assortativity and finds community-like structures like the earlier methods motivated by physics. With Dirichlet Process priors and an efficient implementation the models are highly scalable, as demonstrated with a social network from the Last.fm web site, with 670,000 nodes and 1.89 million links.	Component models for large networks
1703.10935v1	Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.	The Risk of Machine Learning
1610.04811v2	Density matrices are positively semi-definite Hermitian matrices with unit trace that describe the states of quantum systems. Many quantum systems of physical interest can be represented as high-dimensional low rank density matrices. A popular problem in {\it quantum state tomography} (QST) is to estimate the unknown low rank density matrix of a quantum system by conducting Pauli measurements. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we establish the minimax lower bounds in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\leq p\leq +\infty$ for low rank density matrices estimation by Pauli measurements. In our previous paper, these minimax lower bounds are proved under the trace regression model with Gaussian noise and the noise is assumed to have common variance. In this paper, we prove these bounds under the Binomial observation model which meets the actual model in QST. Second, we study the Dantzig estimator (DE) for estimating the unknown low rank density matrix under the Binomial observation model by using Pauli measurements. In our previous papers, we studied the least squares estimator and the projection estimator, where we proved the optimal convergence rates for the least squares estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\leq p\leq 2$ and, under a stronger condition, the optimal convergence rates for the projection estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\leq p\leq +\infty$. In this paper, we show that the results of these two distinct estimators can be simultaneously obtained by the Dantzig estimator. Moreover, better convergence rates in Schatten norm distances can be proved for Dantzig estimator under conditions weaker than those needed in previous papers. When the objective function of DE is replaced by the negative von Neumann entropy, we obtain sharp convergence rate in Kullback-Leibler divergence.	Estimation of low rank density matrices by Pauli measurements
1604.01955v1	Population migration is valuable information which leads to proper decision in urban-planning strategy, massive investment, and many other fields. For instance, inter-city migration is a posterior evidence to see if the government's constrain of population works, and inter-community immigration might be a prior evidence of real estate price hike. With timely data, it is also impossible to compare which city is more favorable for the people, suppose the cities release different new regulations, we could also compare the customers of different real estate development groups, where they come from, where they probably will go. Unfortunately these data was not available. In this paper, leveraging the data generated by positioning team in Didi, we propose a novel approach that timely monitoring population migration from community scale to provincial scale. Migration can be detected as soon as in a week. It could be faster, the setting of a week is for statistical purpose. A monitoring system is developed, then applied nation wide in China, some observations derived from the system will be presented in this paper. This new method of migration perception is origin from the insight that nowadays people mostly moving with their personal Access Point (AP), also known as WiFi hotspot. Assume that the ratio of AP moving to the migration of population is constant, analysis of comparative population migration would be feasible. More exact quantitative research would also be done with few sample research and model regression. The procedures of processing data includes many steps: eliminating the impact of pseudo-migration AP, for instance pocket WiFi, and second-hand traded router; distinguishing moving of population with moving of companies; identifying shifting of AP by the finger print clusters, etc..

1604.08634v2	We present a methodology for clustering N objects which are described by multivariate time series, i.e. several sequences of real-valued random variables. This clustering methodology leverages copulas which are distributions encoding the dependence structure between several random variables. To take fully into account the dependence information while clustering, we need a distance between copulas. In this work, we compare renowned distances between distributions: the Fisher-Rao geodesic distance, related divergences and optimal transport, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Applications of such methodology can be found in the clustering of financial assets. A tutorial, experiments and implementation for reproducible research can be found at www.datagrapple.com/Tech.	Optimal Transport vs. Fisher-Rao distance between Copulas for Clustering  Multivariate Time Series
0903.5328v1	We study the regret of optimal strategies for online convex optimization games. Using von Neumann's minimax theorem, we show that the optimal regret in this adversarial setting is closely related to the behavior of the empirical minimization algorithm in a stochastic process setting: it is equal to the maximum, over joint distributions of the adversary's action sequence, of the difference between a sum of minimal expected losses and the minimal empirical loss. We show that the optimal regret has a natural geometric interpretation, since it can be viewed as the gap in Jensen's inequality for a concave functional--the minimizer over the player's actions of expected loss--defined on a set of probability distributions. We use this expression to obtain upper and lower bounds on the regret of an optimal strategy for a variety of online learning problems. Our method provides upper bounds without the need to construct a learning algorithm; the lower bounds provide explicit optimal strategies for the adversary.	A Stochastic View of Optimal Regret through Minimax Duality
1005.0928v2	We introduce an efficient method for training the linear ranking support vector machine. The method combines cutting plane optimization with red-black tree based approach to subgradient calculations, and has O(m*s+m*log(m)) time complexity, where m is the number of training examples, and s the average number of non-zero features per example. Best previously known training algorithms achieve the same efficiency only for restricted special cases, whereas the proposed approach allows any real valued utility scores in the training data. Experiments demonstrate the superior scalability of the proposed approach, when compared to the fastest existing RankSVM implementations.

1705.00956v3	We consider a class of misspecified dynamical models where the governing term is only approximately known. Under the assumption that observations of the system's evolution are accessible for various initial conditions, our goal is to infer a non-parametric correction to the misspecified driving term such as to faithfully represent the system dynamics and devise system evolution predictions for unobserved initial conditions. We model the unknown correction term as a Gaussian Process and analyze the problem of efficient experimental design to find an optimal correction term under constraints such as a limited experimental budget. We suggest a novel formulation for experimental design for this Gaussian Process and show that approximately optimal (up to a constant factor) designs may be efficiently derived by utilizing results from the literature on submodular optimization. Our numerical experiments exemplify the effectiveness of these techniques.	Experimental Design for Non-Parametric Correction of Misspecified  Dynamical Models
0910.0610v2	There is growing body of learning problems for which it is natural to organize the parameters into matrix, so as to appropriately regularize the parameters under some matrix norm (in order to impose some more sophisticated prior knowledge). This work describes and analyzes a systematic method for constructing such matrix-based, regularization methods. In particular, we focus on how the underlying statistical properties of a given problem can help us decide which regularization function is appropriate. Our methodology is based on the known duality fact: that a function is strongly convex with respect to some norm if and only if its conjugate function is strongly smooth with respect to the dual norm. This result has already been found to be a key component in deriving and analyzing several learning algorithms. We demonstrate the potential of this framework by deriving novel generalization and regret bounds for multi-task learning, multi-class learning, and kernel learning.	Regularization Techniques for Learning with Matrices
1110.3076v1	We consider the problem of covariance matrix estimation in the presence of latent variables. Under suitable conditions, it is possible to learn the marginal covariance matrix of the observed variables via a tractable convex program, where the concentration matrix of the observed variables is decomposed into a sparse matrix (representing the graphical structure of the observed variables) and a low rank matrix (representing the marginalization effect of latent variables). We present an efficient first-order method based on split Bregman to solve the convex problem. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge under mild conditions. We show that our algorithm is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm on both artificial and real-world data. Applying the algorithm to a gene expression data involving thousands of genes, we show that most of the correlation between observed variables can be explained by only a few dozen latent factors.

1412.3432v4	Community detection is a fundamental problem in network analysis which is made more challenging by overlaps between communities which often occur in practice. Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative model for overlapping communities, which can be thought of as a generalization of the degree-corrected stochastic block model. We develop an efficient spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with the overlaps by employing the K-medians algorithm rather than the usual K-means for clustering in the spectral domain. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when networks are not too sparse and the overlaps between communities not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs very well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection.

0806.2831v1	"The problem of supervised classification (or discrimination) with functional data is considered, with a special interest on the popular k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier. First, relying on a recent result by Cerou and Guyader (2006), we prove the consistency of the k-NN classifier for functional data whose distribution belongs to a broad family of Gaussian processes with triangular covariance functions. Second, on a more practical side, we check the behavior of the k-NN method when compared with a few other functional classifiers. This is carried out through a small simulation study and the analysis of several real functional data sets. While no global ""uniform"" winner emerges from such comparisons, the overall performance of the k-NN method, together with its sound intuitive motivation and relative simplicity, suggests that it could represent a reasonable benchmark for the classification problem with functional data."

1711.07104v2	Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a technique for finding latent representations of data. The method has been applied to corpora to construct topic models. However, NMF has likelihood assumptions which are often violated by real document corpora. We present a double parametric bootstrap test for evaluating the fit of an NMF-based topic model based on the duality of the KL divergence and Poisson maximum likelihood estimation. The test correctly identifies whether a topic model based on an NMF approach yields reliable results in simulated and real data.	A Double Parametric Bootstrap Test for Topic Models
0909.4395v1	This paper proposes an original approach to cluster multi-component data sets, including an estimation of the number of clusters. From the construction of a minimal spanning tree with Prim's algorithm, and the assumption that the vertices are approximately distributed according to a Poisson distribution, the number of clusters is estimated by thresholding the Prim's trajectory. The corresponding cluster centroids are then computed in order to initialize the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, also known as $K$-means, which allows to circumvent initialization problems. Some results are derived for evaluating the false positive rate of our cluster detection algorithm, with the help of approximations relevant in Euclidean spaces. Metrics used for measuring similarity between multi-dimensional data points are based on symmetrical divergences. The use of these informational divergences together with the proposed method leads to better results, compared to other clustering methods for the problem of astrophysical data processing. Some applications of this method in the multi/hyper-spectral imagery domain to a satellite view of Paris and to an image of the Mars planet are also presented. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of divergences in our problem, the method with informational divergence as similarity measure is compared with the same method using classical metrics. In the astrophysics application, we also compare the method with the spectral clustering algorithms.	Initialization Free Graph Based Clustering
1708.01206v1	Recurrent major mood episodes and subsyndromal mood instability cause substantial disability in patients with bipolar disorder. Early identification of mood episodes enabling timely mood stabilisation is an important clinical goal. Recent technological advances allow the prospective reporting of mood in real time enabling more accurate, efficient data capture. The complex nature of these data streams in combination with challenge of deriving meaning from missing data mean pose a significant analytic challenge. The signature method is derived from stochastic analysis and has the ability to capture important properties of complex ordered time series data. To explore whether the onset of episodes of mania and depression can be identified using self-reported mood data.

1704.01430v1	We study a model where one target variable Y is correlated with a vector X:=(X_1,...,X_d) of predictor variables being potential causes of Y. We describe a method that infers to what extent the statistical dependences between X and Y are due to the influence of X on Y and to what extent due to a hidden common cause (confounder) of X and Y. The method relies on concentration of measure results for large dimensions d and an independence assumption stating that, in the absence of confounding, the vector of regression coefficients describing the influence of each X on Y typically has `generic orientation' relative to the eigenspaces of the covariance matrix of X. For the special case of a scalar confounder we show that confounding typically spoils this generic orientation in a characteristic way that can be used to quantitatively estimate the amount of confounding.

1710.05552v1	We propose the first fully-adaptive algorithm for pure exploration in linear bandits---the task to find the arm with the largest expected reward, which depends on an unknown parameter linearly. While existing methods partially or entirely fix sequences of arm selections before observing rewards, our method adaptively changes the arm selection strategy based on past observations at each round. We show our sample complexity matches the achievable lower bound up to a constant factor in an extreme case. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the methods by simulations based on both synthetic setting and real-world data, in which our method shows vast improvement over existing methods.

1604.08697v1	Sparse generalized eigenvalue problem plays a pivotal role in a large family of high-dimensional learning tasks, including sparse Fisher's discriminant analysis, canonical correlation analysis, and sufficient dimension reduction. However, the theory of sparse generalized eigenvalue problem remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we exploit a non-convex optimization perspective to study this problem. In particular, we propose the truncated Rayleigh flow method (Rifle) to estimate the leading generalized eigenvector and show that it converges linearly to a solution with the optimal statistical rate of convergence. Our theory involves two key ingredients: (i) a new analysis of the gradient descent method on non-convex objective functions, as well as (ii) a fine-grained characterization of the evolution of sparsity patterns along the solution path. Thorough numerical studies are provided to back up our theory. Finally, we apply our proposed method in the context of sparse sufficient dimension reduction to two gene expression data sets.

1703.01968v3	Entropy Search (ES) and Predictive Entropy Search (PES) are popular and empirically successful Bayesian Optimization techniques. Both rely on a compelling information-theoretic motivation, and maximize the information gained about the $\arg\max$ of the unknown function; yet, both are plagued by the expensive computation for estimating entropies. We propose a new criterion, Max-value Entropy Search (MES), that instead uses the information about the maximum function value. We show relations of MES to other Bayesian optimization methods, and establish a regret bound. We observe that MES maintains or improves the good empirical performance of ES/PES, while tremendously lightening the computational burden. In particular, MES is much more robust to the number of samples used for computing the entropy, and hence more efficient for higher dimensional problems.	Max-value Entropy Search for Efficient Bayesian Optimization
1602.00229v1	Most signal processing problems involve the challenging task of multidimensional probability density function (PDF) estimation. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a family of Rotation-based Iterative Gaussianization (RBIG) transforms. The general framework consists of the sequential application of a univariate marginal Gaussianization transform followed by an orthonormal transform. The proposed procedure looks for differentiable transforms to a known PDF so that the unknown PDF can be estimated at any point of the original domain. In particular, we aim at a zero mean unit covariance Gaussian for convenience. RBIG is formally similar to classical iterative Projection Pursuit (PP) algorithms. However, we show that, unlike in PP methods, the particular class of rotations used has no special qualitative relevance in this context, since looking for interestingness is not a critical issue for PDF estimation. The key difference is that our approach focuses on the univariate part (marginal Gaussianization) of the problem rather than on the multivariate part (rotation). This difference implies that one may select the most convenient rotation suited to each practical application. The differentiability, invertibility and convergence of RBIG are theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Relation to other methods, such as Radial Gaussianization (RG), one-class support vector domain description (SVDD), and deep neural networks (DNN) is also pointed out. The practical performance of RBIG is successfully illustrated in a number of multidimensional problems such as image synthesis, classification, denoising, and multi-information estimation.	Iterative Gaussianization: from ICA to Random Rotations
1510.04850v3	We address the problem of detecting changes in multivariate datastreams, and we investigate the intrinsic difficulty that change-detection methods have to face when the data dimension scales. In particular, we consider a general approach where changes are detected by comparing the distribution of the log-likelihood of the datastream over different time windows. Despite the fact that this approach constitutes the frame of several change-detection methods, its effectiveness when data dimension scales has never been investigated, which is indeed the goal of our paper. We show that the magnitude of the change can be naturally measured by the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions, and that the detectability of a change of a given magnitude worsens when the data dimension increases. This problem, which we refer to as \emph{detectability loss}, is due to the linear relationship between the variance of the log-likelihood and the data dimension. We analytically derive the detectability loss on Gaussian-distributed datastreams, and empirically demonstrate that this problem holds also on real-world datasets and that can be harmful even at low data-dimensions (say, 10).	Change Detection in Multivariate Datastreams: Likelihood and  Detectability Loss
1410.3517v2	We consider the task of fitting a regression model involving interactions among a potentially large set of covariates, in which we wish to enforce strong heredity. We propose FAMILY, a very general framework for this task. Our proposal is a generalization of several existing methods, such as VANISH [Radchenko and James, 2010], hierNet [Bien et al., 2013], the all-pairs lasso, and the lasso using only main effects. It can be formulated as the solution to a convex optimization problem, which we solve using an efficient alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This algorithm has guaranteed convergence to the global optimum, can be easily specialized to any convex penalty function of interest, and allows for a straightforward extension to the setting of generalized linear models. We derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom of FAMILY, and explore its performance in a simulation study and on an HIV sequence data set.	Convex Modeling of Interactions with Strong Heredity
1703.00787v2	We consider a modification of the covariance function in Gaussian processes to correctly account for known linear constraints. By modelling the target function as a transformation of an underlying function, the constraints are explicitly incorporated in the model such that they are guaranteed to be fulfilled by any sample drawn or prediction made. We also propose a constructive procedure for designing the transformation operator and illustrate the result on both simulated and real-data examples.	Linearly constrained Gaussian processes
1709.08770v1	The edge partition model (EPM) is a fundamental Bayesian nonparametric model for extracting an overlapping structure from binary matrix. The EPM adopts a gamma process ($\Gamma$P) prior to automatically shrink the number of active atoms. However, we empirically found that the model shrinkage of the EPM does not typically work appropriately and leads to an overfitted solution. An analysis of the expectation of the EPM's intensity function suggested that the gamma priors for the EPM hyperparameters disturb the model shrinkage effect of the internal $\Gamma$P. In order to ensure that the model shrinkage effect of the EPM works in an appropriate manner, we proposed two novel generative constructions of the EPM: CEPM incorporating constrained gamma priors, and DEPM incorporating Dirichlet priors instead of the gamma priors. Furthermore, all DEPM's model parameters including the infinite atoms of the $\Gamma$P prior could be marginalized out, and thus it was possible to derive a truly infinite DEPM (IDEPM) that can be efficiently inferred using a collapsed Gibbs sampler. We experimentally confirmed that the model shrinkage of the proposed models works well and that the IDEPM indicated state-of-the-art performance in generalization ability, link prediction accuracy, mixing efficiency, and convergence speed.	On the Model Shrinkage Effect of Gamma Process Edge Partition Models
1204.1276v4	We obtain a tight distribution-specific characterization of the sample complexity of large-margin classification with L2 regularization: We introduce the margin-adapted dimension, which is a simple function of the second order statistics of the data distribution, and show distribution-specific upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity, both governed by the margin-adapted dimension of the data distribution. The upper bounds are universal, and the lower bounds hold for the rich family of sub-Gaussian distributions with independent features. We conclude that this new quantity tightly characterizes the true sample complexity of large-margin classification. To prove the lower bound, we develop several new tools of independent interest. These include new connections between shattering and hardness of learning, new properties of shattering with linear classifiers, and a new lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of a random Gram matrix generated by sub-Gaussian variables. Our results can be used to quantitatively compare large margin learning to other learning rules, and to improve the effectiveness of methods that use sample complexity bounds, such as active learning.	Distribution-Dependent Sample Complexity of Large Margin Learning
1101.2017v2	Although there is a rich literature on methods for allowing the variance in a univariate regression model to vary with predictors, time and other factors, relatively little has been done in the multivariate case. Our focus is on developing a class of nonparametric covariance regression models, which allow an unknown p x p covariance matrix to change flexibly with predictors. The proposed modeling framework induces a prior on a collection of covariance matrices indexed by predictors through priors for predictor-dependent loadings matrices in a factor model. In particular, the predictor-dependent loadings are characterized as a sparse combination of a collection of unknown dictionary functions (e.g, Gaussian process random functions). The induced covariance is then a regularized quadratic function of these dictionary elements. Our proposed framework leads to a highly-flexible, but computationally tractable formulation with simple conjugate posterior updates that can readily handle missing data. Theoretical properties are discussed and the methods are illustrated through simulations studies and an application to the Google Flu Trends data.	Bayesian Nonparametric Covariance Regression
1705.10888v2	The Gaussian process state space model (GPSSM) is a non-linear dynamical system, where unknown transition and/or measurement mappings are described by GPs. Most research in GPSSMs has focussed on the state estimation problem, i.e., computing a posterior of the latent state given the model. However, the key challenge in GPSSMs has not been satisfactorily addressed yet: system identification, i.e., learning the model. To address this challenge, we impose a structured Gaussian variational posterior distribution over the latent states, which is parameterised by a recognition model in the form of a bi-directional recurrent neural network. Inference with this structure allows us to recover a posterior smoothed over sequences of data. We provide a practical algorithm for efficiently computing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using the reparameterisation trick. This further allows for the use of arbitrary kernels within the GPSSM. We demonstrate that the learnt GPSSM can efficiently generate plausible future trajectories of the identified system after only observing a small number of episodes from the true system.	Identification of Gaussian Process State Space Models
1707.04368v1	In this study, we tested the interaction effect of multimodal datasets using a novel method called the kernel method for detecting higher order interactions among biologically relevant mulit-view data. Using a semiparametric method on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we used a standard mixed-effects linear model and derived a score-based variance component statistic that tests for higher order interactions between multi-view data. The proposed method offers an intangible framework for the identification of higher order interaction effects (e.g., three way interaction) between genetics, brain imaging, and epigenetic data. Extensive numerical simulation studies were first conducted to evaluate the performance of this method. Finally, this method was evaluated using data from the Mind Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation data, respectfully, in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. We treated each gene-derived SNPs, region of interest (ROI) and gene-derived DNA methylation as a single testing unit, which are combined into triplets for evaluation. In addition, cardiovascular disease risk factors such as age, gender, and body mass index were assessed as covariates on hippocampal volume and compared between triplets. Our method identified $13$-triplets ($p$-values $\leq 0.001$) that included $6$ gene-derived SNPs, $10$ ROIs, and $6$ gene-derived DNA methylations that correlated with changes in hippocampal volume, suggesting that these triplets may be important in explaining schizophrenia-related neurodegeneration. With strong evidence ($p$-values $\leq 0.000001$), the triplet ({\bf MAGI2, CRBLCrus1.L, FBXO28}) has the potential to distinguish schizophrenia patients from the healthy control variations.

0910.5561v1	We propose a method to infer causal structures containing both discrete and continuous variables. The idea is to select causal hypotheses for which the conditional density of every variable, given its causes, becomes smooth. We define a family of smooth densities and conditional densities by second order exponential models, i.e., by maximizing conditional entropy subject to first and second statistical moments. If some of the variables take only values in proper subsets of R^n, these conditionals can induce different families of joint distributions even for Markov-equivalent graphs. We consider the case of one binary and one real-valued variable where the method can distinguish between cause and effect. Using this example, we describe that sometimes a causal hypothesis must be rejected because P(effect|cause) and P(cause) share algorithmic information (which is untypical if they are chosen independently). This way, our method is in the same spirit as faithfulness-based causal inference because it also rejects non-generic mutual adjustments among DAG-parameters.

1506.02520v1	The subdifferential of convex functions of the singular spectrum of real matrices has been widely studied in matrix analysis, optimization and automatic control theory. Convex analysis and optimization over spaces of tensors is now gaining much interest due to its potential applications to signal processing, statistics and engineering. The goal of this paper is to present an applications to the problem of low rank tensor recovery based on linear random measurement by extending the results of Tropp to the tensors setting.

1401.6623v3	"In a recent paper, it is shown that the LASSO algorithm exhibits ""near-ideal behavior,"" in the following sense: Suppose $y = Az + \eta$ where $A$ satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP) with a sufficiently small constant, and $\Vert \eta \Vert_2 \leq \epsilon$. Then minimizing $\Vert z \Vert_1$ subject to $\Vert y - Az \Vert_2 \leq \epsilon$ leads to an estimate $\hat{x}$ whose error $\Vert \hat{x} - x \Vert_2$ is bounded by a universal constant times the error achieved by an ""oracle"" that knows the location of the nonzero components of $x$. In the world of optimization, the LASSO algorithm has been generalized in several directions such as the group LASSO, the sparse group LASSO, either without or with tree-structured overlapping groups, and most recently, the sorted LASSO. In this paper, it is shown that {\it any algorithm\/} exhibits near-ideal behavior in the above sense, provided only that (i) the norm used to define the sparsity index is ""decomposable,"" (ii) the penalty norm that is minimized in an effort to enforce sparsity is ""$\gamma$-decomposable,"" and (iii) a ""compressibility condition"" in terms of a group restricted isometry property is satisfied. Specifically, the group LASSO, and the sparse group LASSO (with some permissible overlap in the groups), as well as the sorted $\ell_1$-norm minimization all exhibit near-ideal behavior. Explicit bounds on the residual error are derived that contain previously known results as special cases."	Near-Ideal Behavior of Compressed Sensing Algorithms
1410.7291v2	"In this paper, we focus on developing efficient sensitivity analysis methods for a computationally expensive objective function $f(x)$ in the case that the minimization of it has just been performed. Here ""computationally expensive"" means that each of its evaluation takes significant amount of time, and therefore our main goal to use a small number of function evaluations of $f(x)$ to further infer the sensitivity information of these different parameters. Correspondingly, we consider the optimization procedure as an adaptive experimental design and re-use its available function evaluations as the initial design points to establish a surrogate model $s(x)$ (or called response surface). The sensitivity analysis is performed on $s(x)$, which is an lieu of $f(x)$. Furthermore, we propose a new local multivariate sensitivity measure, for example, around the optimal solution, for high dimensional problems. Then a corresponding ""objective-oriented experimental design"" is proposed in order to make the generated surrogate $s(x)$ better suitable for the accurate calculation of the proposed specific local sensitivity quantities. In addition, we demonstrate the better performance of the Gaussian radial basis function interpolator over Kriging in our cases, which are of relatively high dimensionality and few experimental design points. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the optimization procedure and the ""objective-oriented experimental design"" behavior much better than the classical Latin Hypercube Design. In addition, the performance of Kriging is not as good as Gaussian RBF, especially in the case of high dimensional problems."

1306.3862v1	The problem of low-rank matrix estimation recently received a lot of attention due to challenging applications. A lot of work has been done on rank-penalized methods and convex relaxation, both on the theoretical and applied sides. However, only a few papers considered Bayesian estimation. In this paper, we review the different type of priors considered on matrices to favour low-rank. We also prove that the obtained Bayesian estimators, under suitable assumptions, enjoys the same optimality properties as the ones based on penalization.

1501.02102v2	A measure of dependence is said to be equitable if it gives similar scores to equally noisy relationship of different types. In practice, we do not know what kind of functional relationship is underlying two given observations, Hence the equitability of dependence measure is critical in analysis and by scoring relationships according to an equitable measure one hopes to find important patterns of any type of further examination. In this paper, we introduce our definition of equitability of a dependence measure, which is naturally from this initial description, and Further more power-equitable(weak-equitable) is introduced which is of the most practical meaning in evaluating the equitablity of a dependence measure.

1202.3727v1	We show that the Bregman divergence provides a rich framework to estimate unnormalized statistical models for continuous or discrete random variables, that is, models which do not integrate or sum to one, respectively. We prove that recent estimation methods such as noise-contrastive estimation, ratio matching, and score matching belong to the proposed framework, and explain their interconnection based on supervised learning. Further, we discuss the role of boosting in unsupervised learning.	Bregman divergence as general framework to estimate unnormalized  statistical models
1801.09144v1	For large scale on-line inference problems the update strategy is critical for performance. We derive an adaptive scan Gibbs sampler that optimizes the update frequency by selecting an optimum mini-batch size. We demonstrate performance of our adaptive batch-size Gibbs sampler by comparing it against the collapsed Gibbs sampler for Bayesian Lasso, Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) graphical models.

1307.3400v1	Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (and thus Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a finite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families.	Thompson Sampling for 1-Dimensional Exponential Family Bandits
1001.1557v2	We study graph estimation and density estimation in high dimensions, using a family of density estimators based on forest structured undirected graphical models. For density estimation, we do not assume the true distribution corresponds to a forest; rather, we form kernel density estimates of the bivariate and univariate marginals, and apply Kruskal's algorithm to estimate the optimal forest on held out data. We prove an oracle inequality on the excess risk of the resulting estimator relative to the risk of the best forest. For graph estimation, we consider the problem of estimating forests with restricted tree sizes. We prove that finding a maximum weight spanning forest with restricted tree size is NP-hard, and develop an approximation algorithm for this problem. Viewing the tree size as a complexity parameter, we then select a forest using data splitting, and prove bounds on excess risk and structure selection consistency of the procedure. Experiments with simulated data and microarray data indicate that the methods are a practical alternative to Gaussian graphical models.	Forest Density Estimation
1509.08582v1	We consider the problem of transforming samples from one continuous source distribution into samples from another target distribution. We demonstrate with optimal transport theory that when the source distribution can be easily sampled from and the target distribution is log-concave, this can be tractably solved with convex optimization. We show that a special case of this, when the source is the prior and the target is the posterior, is Bayesian inference. Here, we can tractably calculate the normalization constant and draw posterior i.i.d. samples. Remarkably, our Bayesian tractability criterion is simply log concavity of the prior and likelihood: the same criterion for tractable calculation of the maximum a posteriori point estimate. With simulated data, we demonstrate how we can attain the Bayes risk in simulations. With physiologic data, we demonstrate improvements over point estimation in intensive care unit outcome prediction and electroencephalography-based sleep staging.	Tractable Fully Bayesian Inference via Convex Optimization and Optimal  Transport Theory
1104.5525v1	We analyze the convergence of gradient-based optimization algorithms that base their updates on delayed stochastic gradient information. The main application of our results is to the development of gradient-based distributed optimization algorithms where a master node performs parameter updates while worker nodes compute stochastic gradients based on local information in parallel, which may give rise to delays due to asynchrony. We take motivation from statistical problems where the size of the data is so large that it cannot fit on one computer; with the advent of huge datasets in biology, astronomy, and the internet, such problems are now common. Our main contribution is to show that for smooth stochastic problems, the delays are asymptotically negligible and we can achieve order-optimal convergence results. In application to distributed optimization, we develop procedures that overcome communication bottlenecks and synchronization requirements. We show $n$-node architectures whose optimization error in stochastic problems---in spite of asynchronous delays---scales asymptotically as $\order(1 / \sqrt{nT})$ after $T$ iterations. This rate is known to be optimal for a distributed system with $n$ nodes even in the absence of delays. We additionally complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments on a statistical machine learning task.	Distributed Delayed Stochastic Optimization
1709.05321v2	We introduce a new approach to functional causal modeling from observational data. The approach, called Causal Generative Neural Networks (CGNN), leverages the power of neural networks to learn a generative model of the joint distribution of the observed variables, by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between generated and observed data. An approximate learning criterion is proposed to scale the computational cost of the approach to linear complexity in the number of observations. The performance of CGNN is studied throughout three experiments. First, we apply CGNN to the problem of cause-effect inference, where two CGNNs model $P(Y|X,\textrm{noise})$ and $P(X|Y,\textrm{noise})$ identify the best causal hypothesis out of $X\rightarrow Y$ and $Y\rightarrow X$. Second, CGNN is applied to the problem of identifying v-structures and conditional independences. Third, we apply CGNN to problem of multivariate functional causal modeling: given a skeleton describing the dependences in a set of random variables $\{X_1, \ldots, X_d\}$, CGNN orients the edges in the skeleton to uncover the directed acyclic causal graph describing the causal structure of the random variables. On all three tasks, CGNN is extensively assessed on both artificial and real-world data, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art. Finally, we extend CGNN to handle the case of confounders, where latent variables are involved in the overall causal model.	Learning Functional Causal Models with Generative Neural Networks
1602.03670v2	Extracting the underlying low-dimensional space where high-dimensional signals often reside has long been at the center of numerous algorithms in the signal processing and machine learning literature during the past few decades. At the same time, working with incomplete (partly observed) large scale datasets has recently been commonplace for diverse reasons. This so called {\it big data era} we are currently living calls for devising online subspace learning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data. Their envisaged objective is to {\it recursively} estimate the unknown subspace by processing streaming data sequentially, thus reducing computational complexity, while obviating the need for storing the whole dataset in memory. In this paper, an online variational Bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations is presented. To account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace, commonly met in practice, low-rankness is explicitly imposed on the sought subspace data matrix by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning principles. Moreover, sparsity, {\it simultaneously} to low-rankness, is favored on the subspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian scheme that is adopted. In doing so, the proposed algorithm becomes adept in dealing with applications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse, as, e.g., in sparse dictionary learning problems. As shown, the new subspace tracking scheme outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy, in a variety of experiments conducted on simulated and real data.

1802.08167v1	We present the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model (CGPCM), a doubly nonparametric model for causal, spectrally complex dynamical phenomena. The CGPCM is a generative model in which white noise is passed through a causal, nonparametric-window moving-average filter, a construction that we show to be equivalent to a Gaussian process with a nonparametric kernel that is biased towards causally-generated signals. We develop enhanced variational inference and learning schemes for the CGPCM and its previous acausal variant, the GPCM (Tobar et al., 2015b), that significantly improve statistical accuracy. These modelling and inferential contributions are demonstrated on a range of synthetic and real-world signals.	Learning Causally-Generated Stationary Time Series
1401.8078v1	An inductive probabilistic classification rule must generally obey the principles of Bayesian predictive inference, such that all observed and unobserved stochastic quantities are jointly modeled and the parameter uncertainty is fully acknowledged through the posterior predictive distribution. Several such rules have been recently considered and their asymptotic behavior has been characterized under the assumption that the observed features or variables used for building a classifier are conditionally independent given a simultaneous labeling of both the training samples and those from an unknown origin. Here we extend the theoretical results to predictive classifiers acknowledging feature dependencies either through graphical models or sparser alternatives defined as stratified graphical models. We also show through experimentation with both synthetic and real data that the predictive classifiers based on stratified graphical models have consistently best accuracy compared with the predictive classifiers based on either conditionally independent features or on ordinary graphical models.

1106.0800v3	The exploration-exploitation trade-off is among the central challenges of reinforcement learning. The optimal Bayesian solution is intractable in general. This paper studies to what extent analytic statements about optimal learning are possible if all beliefs are Gaussian processes. A first order approximation of learning of both loss and dynamics, for nonlinear, time-varying systems in continuous time and space, subject to a relatively weak restriction on the dynamics, is described by an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation. An approximate finite-dimensional projection gives an impression for how this result may be helpful.	Optimal Reinforcement Learning for Gaussian Systems
1202.6078v1	We consider the problem of learning classifiers for labeled data that has been distributed across several nodes. Our goal is to find a single classifier, with small approximation error, across all datasets while minimizing the communication between nodes. This setting models real-world communication bottlenecks in the processing of massive distributed datasets. We present several very general sampling-based solutions as well as some two-way protocols which have a provable exponential speed-up over any one-way protocol. We focus on core problems for noiseless data distributed across two or more nodes. The techniques we introduce are reminiscent of active learning, but rather than actively probing labels, nodes actively communicate with each other, each node simultaneously learning the important data from another node.

1607.02676v1	Ensemble of regression trees have become popular statistical tools for the estimation of conditional mean given a set of predictors. However, quantile regression trees and their ensembles have not yet garnered much attention despite the increasing popularity of the linear quantile regression model. This work proposes a Bayesian quantile additive regression trees model that shows very good predictive performance illustrated using simulation studies and real data applications. Further extension to tackle binary classification problems is also considered.	Bayesian quantile additive regression trees
1802.04846v1	We provide a comprehensive overview and tooling for GP modeling with non-Gaussian likelihoods using state space methods. The state space formulation allows for solving one-dimensional GP models in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and memory complexity. While existing literature has focused on the connection between GP regression and state space methods, the computational primitives allowing for inference using general likelihoods in combination with the Laplace approximation (LA), variational Bayes (VB), and assumed density filtering (ADF) / expectation propagation (EP) schemes has been largely overlooked. We present means of combining the efficient $\mathcal{O}(n)$ state space methodology with existing inference methods. We also further extend existing methods, and provide unifying code implementing all approaches.	State Space Gaussian Processes with Non-Gaussian Likelihood
0912.1064v1	Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying features from a quickly varying multidimensional signal. An open source Matlab-implementation sfa-tk makes SFA easily useable. We show here that under certain circumstances, namely when the covariance matrix of the nonlinearly expanded data does not have full rank, this implementation runs into numerical instabilities. We propse a modified algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD) which is free of those instabilities even in the case where the rank of the matrix is only less than 10% of its size. Furthermore we show that an alternative way of handling the numerical problems is to inject a small amount of noise into the multidimensional input signal which can restore a rank-deficient covariance matrix to full rank, however at the price of modifying the original data and the need for noise parameter tuning.

1506.03850v2	We introduce GAMSEL (Generalized Additive Model Selection), a penalized likelihood approach for fitting sparse generalized additive models in high dimension. Our method interpolates between null, linear and additive models by allowing the effect of each variable to be estimated as being either zero, linear, or a low-complexity curve, as determined by the data. We present a blockwise coordinate descent procedure for efficiently optimizing the penalized likelihood objective over a dense grid of the tuning parameter, producing a regularization path of additive models. We demonstrate the performance of our method on both real and simulated data examples, and compare it with existing techniques for additive model selection.	Generalized Additive Model Selection
1011.0096v1	In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for empirical risk minimizers. In the general setting, we prove sanity-check bounds in the spirit of \cite{KR99} \textquotedblleft\textit{bounds showing that the worst-case error of this estimate is not much worse that of training error estimate} \textquotedblright . General loss functions and class of predictors with finite VC-dimension are considered. We closely follow the formalism introduced by \cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$% -fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\upsilon$-out cross-validation. In particular, we focus on proving the consistency of the various cross-validation procedures. We point out the interest of each cross-validation procedure in terms of rate of convergence. An estimation curve with transition phases depending on the cross-validation procedure and not only on the percentage of observations in the test sample gives a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation. An interesting consequence is that the size of the test sample is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the cross-validation procedure.

0706.3434v2	In this paper, we consider the problem of partitioning a small data sample drawn from a mixture of $k$ product distributions. We are interested in the case that individual features are of low average quality $\gamma$, and we want to use as few of them as possible to correctly partition the sample. We analyze a spectral technique that is able to approximately optimize the total data size--the product of number of data points $n$ and the number of features $K$--needed to correctly perform this partitioning as a function of $1/\gamma$ for $K>n$. Our goal is motivated by an application in clustering individuals according to their population of origin using markers, when the divergence between any two of the populations is small.

1105.2416v2	We present two alternative ways to apply PAC-Bayesian analysis to sequences of dependent random variables. The first is based on a new lemma that enables to bound expectations of convex functions of certain dependent random variables by expectations of the same functions of independent Bernoulli random variables. This lemma provides an alternative tool to Hoeffding-Azuma inequality to bound concentration of martingale values. Our second approach is based on integration of Hoeffding-Azuma inequality with PAC-Bayesian analysis. We also introduce a way to apply PAC-Bayesian analysis in situation of limited feedback. We combine the new tools to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization and regret bounds for the multiarmed bandit problem. Although our regret bound is not yet as tight as state-of-the-art regret bounds based on other well-established techniques, our results significantly expand the range of potential applications of PAC-Bayesian analysis and introduce a new analysis tool to reinforcement learning and many other fields, where martingales and limited feedback are encountered.

1311.5954v2	For random graphs distributed according to stochastic blockmodels, a special case of latent position graphs, adjacency spectral embedding followed by appropriate vertex classification is asymptotically Bayes optimal; but this approach requires knowledge of and critically depends on the model dimension. In this paper, we propose a sparse representation vertex classifier which does not require information about the model dimension. This classifier represents a test vertex as a sparse combination of the vertices in the training set and uses the recovered coefficients to classify the test vertex. We prove consistency of our proposed classifier for stochastic blockmodels, and demonstrate that the sparse representation classifier can predict vertex labels with higher accuracy than adjacency spectral embedding approaches via both simulation studies and real data experiments. Our results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed vertex classifier when the model dimension is unknown.	Robust Vertex Classification
1202.3746v1	Standard maximum likelihood estimation cannot be applied to discrete energy-based models in the general case because the computation of exact model probabilities is intractable. Recent research has seen the proposal of several new estimators designed specifically to overcome this intractability, but virtually nothing is known about their theoretical properties. In this paper, we present a generalized estimator that unifies many of the classical and recently proposed estimators. We use results from the standard asymptotic theory for M-estimators to derive a generic expression for the asymptotic covariance matrix of our generalized estimator. We apply these results to study the relative statistical efficiency of classical pseudolikelihood and the recently-proposed ratio matching estimator.

1610.10025v5	We consider the problem of constructing diffusion operators high dimensional data $X$ to address counterfactual functions $F$, such as individualized treatment effectiveness. We propose and construct a new diffusion metric $K_F$ that captures both the local geometry of $X$ and the directions of variance of $F$. The resulting diffusion metric is then used to define a localized filtration of $F$ and answer counterfactual questions pointwise, particularly in situations such as drug trials where an individual patient's outcomes cannot be studied long term both taking and not taking a medication. We validate the model on synthetic and real world clinical trials, and create individualized notions of benefit from treatment.	Function Driven Diffusion for Personalized Counterfactual Inference
1009.1690v2	This paper addresses the general problem of modelling and learning rank data with ties. We propose a probabilistic generative model, that models the process as permutations over partitions. This results in super-exponential combinatorial state space with unknown numbers of partitions and unknown ordering among them. We approach the problem from the discrete choice theory, where subsets are chosen in a stagewise manner, reducing the state space per each stage significantly. Further, we show that with suitable parameterisation, we can still learn the models in linear time. We evaluate the proposed models on the problem of learning to rank with the data from the recently held Yahoo! challenge, and demonstrate that the models are competitive against well-known rivals.

1705.03536v2	"A semi-parametric, non-linear regression model in the presence of latent variables is introduced. These latent variables can correspond to unmodeled phenomena or unmeasured agents in a complex networked system. This new formulation allows joint estimation of certain non-linearities in the system, the direct interactions between measured variables, and the effects of unmodeled elements on the observed system. The particular form of the model adopted is justified, and learning is posed as a regularized maximum likelihood estimation. This leads to classes of structured convex optimization problems with a ""sparse plus low-rank"" flavor. Relations between the proposed model and several common model paradigms, such as those of Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Vector Autoregression (VAR), are established. Particularly in the VAR setting, the low-rank contributions can come from broad trends exhibited in the time series. Details of the algorithm for learning the model are presented. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the model and the estimation algorithm on simulated and real data."	SILVar: Single Index Latent Variable Models
1106.5236v1	We study a generalized framework for structured sparsity. It extends the well-known methods of Lasso and Group Lasso by incorporating additional constraints on the variables as part of a convex optimization problem. This framework provides a straightforward way of favouring prescribed sparsity patterns, such as orderings, contiguous regions and overlapping groups, among others. Existing optimization methods are limited to specific constraint sets and tend to not scale well with sample size and dimensionality. We propose a novel first order proximal method, which builds upon results on fixed points and successive approximations. The algorithm can be applied to a general class of conic and norm constraints sets and relies on a proximity operator subproblem which can be computed explicitly. Experiments on different regression problems demonstrate the efficiency of the optimization algorithm and its scalability with the size of the problem. They also demonstrate state of the art statistical performance, which improves over Lasso and StructOMP.	A General Framework for Structured Sparsity via Proximal Optimization
1512.01666v1	Stochastic variational inference for collapsed models has recently been successfully applied to large scale topic modelling. In this paper, we propose a stochastic collapsed variational inference algorithm in the sequential data setting. Our algorithm is applicable to both finite hidden Markov models and hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov models, and to any datasets generated by emission distributions in the exponential family. Our experiment results on two discrete datasets show that our inference is both more efficient and more accurate than its uncollapsed version, stochastic variational inference.

1712.09988v2	There has been growing interest in how economists can import machine learning tools designed for prediction to accelerate and automate the model selection process, while still retaining desirable inference properties for causal parameters. Focusing on partially linear models, we extend the Double ML framework to allow for (1) a number of treatments that may grow with the sample size and (2) the analysis of panel data under sequentially exogenous errors. Our low-dimensional treatment (LD) regime directly extends the work in [Chernozhukov et al., 2016], by showing that the coefficients from a second stage, ordinary least squares estimator attain root-n convergence and desired coverage even if the dimensionality of treatment is allowed to grow. In a high-dimensional sparse (HDS) regime, we show that second stage LASSO and debiased LASSO have asymptotic properties equivalent to oracle estimators with no upstream error. We argue that these advances make Double ML methods a desirable alternative for practitioners estimating short-term demand elasticities in non-contractual settings.

1408.0145v2	This contribution deals with the generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm in the domain of Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The generalized symmetric version of FastICA has been shown to have the potential to achieve the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) by allowing the usage of different nonlinearity functions in its parallel implementations of one-unit FastICA. In spite of this appealing property, a rigorous study of the asymptotic error of the generalized symmetric FastICA algorithm is still missing in the community. In fact, all the existing results exhibit certain limitations, such as ignoring the impact of data standardization on the asymptotic statistics or being based on a heuristic approach. In this work, we aim at filling this blank. The first result of this contribution is the characterization of the limits of the generalized symmetric FastICA. It is shown that the algorithm optimizes a function that is a sum of the contrast functions used by traditional one-unit FastICA with a correction of the sign. Based on this characterization, we derive a closed-form analytic expression of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the generalized symmetric FastICA estimator using the method of estimating equation and M-estimator.

1610.01492v1	Motivated by electricity consumption metering, we extend existing nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms to use linear measurements as observations, instead of matrix entries. The objective is to estimate multiple time series at a fine temporal scale from temporal aggregates measured on each individual series. Furthermore, our algorithm is extended to take into account individual autocorrelation to provide better estimation, using a recent convex relaxation of quadratically constrained quadratic program. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world electricity consumption datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our matrix recovery algorithms.

1605.09459v4	Generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) aims at finding latent low-dimensional common structure from multiple views (feature vectors in different domains) of the same entities. Unlike principal component analysis (PCA) that handles a single view, (G)CCA is able to integrate information from different feature spaces. Here we focus on MAX-VAR GCCA, a popular formulation which has recently gained renewed interest in multilingual processing and speech modeling. The classic MAX-VAR GCCA problem can be solved optimally via eigen-decomposition of a matrix that compounds the (whitened) correlation matrices of the views; but this solution has serious scalability issues, and is not directly amenable to incorporating pertinent structural constraints such as non-negativity and sparsity on the canonical components. We posit regularized MAX-VAR GCCA as a non-convex optimization problem and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to handle it. Our algorithm alternates between {\em inexact} solutions of a regularized least squares subproblem and a manifold-constrained non-convex subproblem, thereby achieving substantial memory and computational savings. An important benefit of our design is that it can easily handle structure-promoting regularization. We show that the algorithm globally converges to a critical point at a sublinear rate, and approaches a global optimal solution at a linear rate when no regularization is considered. Judiciously designed simulations and large-scale word embedding tasks are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

1711.06494v2	Compression of Neural Networks (NN) has become a highly studied topic in recent years. The main reason for this is the demand for industrial scale usage of NNs such as deploying them on mobile devices, storing them efficiently, transmitting them via band-limited channels and most importantly doing inference at scale. In this work, we propose to join the Soft-Weight Sharing and Variational Dropout approaches that show strong results to define a new state-of-the-art in terms of model compression.	Improved Bayesian Compression
1712.04543v1	Subset selection for multiple linear regression aims to construct a regression model that minimizes errors by selecting a small number of explanatory variables. Once a model is built, various statistical tests and diagnostics are conducted to validate the model and to determine whether regression assumptions are met. Most traditional approaches require human decisions at this step, for example, the user adding or removing a variable until a satisfactory model is obtained. However, this trial-and-error strategy cannot guarantee that a subset that minimizes the errors while satisfying all regression assumptions will be found. In this paper, we propose a fully automated model building procedure for multiple linear regression subset selection that integrates model building and validation based on mathematical programming. The proposed model minimizes mean squared errors while ensuring that the majority of the important regression assumptions are met. When no subset satisfies all of the considered regression assumptions, our model provides an alternative subset that satisfies most of these assumptions. Computational results show that our model yields better solutions (i.e., satisfying more regression assumptions) compared to benchmark models while maintaining similar explanatory power.

1204.6583v1	In binary classification problems, mainly two approaches have been proposed; one is loss function approach and the other is uncertainty set approach. The loss function approach is applied to major learning algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and boosting methods. The loss function represents the penalty of the decision function on the training samples. In the learning algorithm, the empirical mean of the loss function is minimized to obtain the classifier. Against a backdrop of the development of mathematical programming, nowadays learning algorithms based on loss functions are widely applied to real-world data analysis. In addition, statistical properties of such learning algorithms are well-understood based on a lots of theoretical works. On the other hand, the learning method using the so-called uncertainty set is used in hard-margin SVM, mini-max probability machine (MPM) and maximum margin MPM. In the learning algorithm, firstly, the uncertainty set is defined for each binary label based on the training samples. Then, the best separating hyperplane between the two uncertainty sets is employed as the decision function. This is regarded as an extension of the maximum-margin approach. The uncertainty set approach has been studied as an application of robust optimization in the field of mathematical programming. The statistical properties of learning algorithms with uncertainty sets have not been intensively studied. In this paper, we consider the relation between the above two approaches. We point out that the uncertainty set is described by using the level set of the conjugate of the loss function. Based on such relation, we study statistical properties of learning algorithms using uncertainty sets.	A Conjugate Property between Loss Functions and Uncertainty Sets in  Classification Problems
1402.6863v3	We provide a correction to the expression for scoring Gaussian directed acyclic graphical models derived in Geiger and Heckerman [Ann. Statist. 30 (2002) 1414-1440] and discuss how to evaluate the score efficiently.	Addendum on the scoring of Gaussian directed acyclic graphical models
1106.0967v1	In this paper, we first demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing, whose estimators are positive definite kernels, can be naturally integrated with learning algorithms such as SVM and logistic regression. We adopt a simple scheme to transform the nonlinear (resemblance) kernel into linear (inner product) kernel; and hence large-scale problems can be solved extremely efficiently. Our method provides a simple effective solution to large-scale learning in massive and extremely high-dimensional datasets, especially when data do not fit in memory. We then compare b-bit minwise hashing with the Vowpal Wabbit (VW) algorithm (which is related the Count-Min (CM) sketch). Interestingly, VW has the same variances as random projections. Our theoretical and empirical comparisons illustrate that usually $b$-bit minwise hashing is significantly more accurate (at the same storage) than VW (and random projections) in binary data. Furthermore, $b$-bit minwise hashing can be combined with VW to achieve further improvements in terms of training speed, especially when $b$ is large.	Hashing Algorithms for Large-Scale Learning
1010.0789v2	In this paper, we propose three approaches for the estimation of the Tucker decomposition of multi-way arrays (tensors) from partial observations. All approaches are formulated as convex minimization problems. Therefore, the minimum is guaranteed to be unique. The proposed approaches can automatically estimate the number of factors (rank) through the optimization. Thus, there is no need to specify the rank beforehand. The key technique we employ is the trace norm regularization, which is a popular approach for the estimation of low-rank matrices. In addition, we propose a simple heuristic to improve the interpretability of the obtained factorization. The advantages and disadvantages of three proposed approaches are demonstrated through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets. We show that the proposed convex optimization based approaches are more accurate in predictive performance, faster, and more reliable in recovering a known multilinear structure than conventional approaches.	Estimation of low-rank tensors via convex optimization
1602.06349v1	We propose the segmented iHMM (siHMM), a hierarchical infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that supports a simple, efficient inference scheme. The siHMM is well suited to segmentation problems, where the goal is to identify points at which a time series transitions from one relatively stable regime to a new regime. Conventional iHMMs often struggle with such problems, since they have no mechanism for distinguishing between high- and low-level dynamics. Hierarchical HMMs (HHMMs) can do better, but they require much more complex and expensive inference algorithms. The siHMM retains the simplicity and efficiency of the iHMM, but outperforms it on a variety of segmentation problems, achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of a more complicated HHMM.

1203.0117v3	Properties of data are frequently seen to vary depending on the sampled situations, which usually changes along a time evolution or owing to environmental effects. One way to analyze such data is to find invariances, or representative features kept constant over changes. The aim of this paper is to identify one such feature, namely interactions or dependencies among variables that are common across multiple datasets collected under different conditions. To that end, we propose a common substructure learning (CSSL) framework based on a graphical Gaussian model. We further present a simple learning algorithm based on the Dual Augmented Lagrangian and the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. We confirm the performance of CSSL over other existing techniques in finding unchanging dependency structures in multiple datasets through numerical simulations on synthetic data and through a real world application to anomaly detection in automobile sensors.

1209.0016v2	Maximum Variance Unfolding is one of the main methods for (nonlinear) dimensionality reduction. We study its large sample limit, providing specific rates of convergence under standard assumptions. We find that it is consistent when the underlying submanifold is isometric to a convex subset, and we provide some simple examples where it fails to be consistent.	On the convergence of maximum variance unfolding
1104.5687v2	We state the problem of inverse reinforcement learning in terms of preference elicitation, resulting in a principled (Bayesian) statistical formulation. This generalises previous work on Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning and allows us to obtain a posterior distribution on the agent's preferences, policy and optionally, the obtained reward sequence, from observations. We examine the relation of the resulting approach to other statistical methods for inverse reinforcement learning via analysis and experimental results. We show that preferences can be determined accurately, even if the observed agent's policy is sub-optimal with respect to its own preferences. In that case, significantly improved policies with respect to the agent's preferences are obtained, compared to both other methods and to the performance of the demonstrated policy.

1305.4152v5	Spatio-temporal point process models play a central role in the analysis of spatially distributed systems in several disciplines. Yet, scalable inference remains computa- tionally challenging both due to the high resolution modelling generally required and the analytically intractable likelihood function. Here, we exploit the sparsity structure typical of (spatially) discretised log-Gaussian Cox process models by using approximate message-passing algorithms. The proposed algorithms scale well with the state dimension and the length of the temporal horizon with moderate loss in distributional accuracy. They hence provide a flexible and faster alternative to both non-linear filtering-smoothing type algorithms and to approaches that implement the Laplace method or expectation propagation on (block) sparse latent Gaussian models. We infer the parameters of the latent Gaussian model using a structured variational Bayes approach. We demonstrate the proposed framework on simulation studies with both Gaussian and point-process observations and use it to reconstruct the conflict intensity and dynamics in Afghanistan from the WikiLeaks Afghan War Diary.

1703.01444v1	This paper studies a new Bayesian algorithm for the joint reconstruction and classification of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) images, with application to the identification of human skin lentigo. The proposed Bayesian approach takes advantage of the distribution of the multiplicative speckle noise affecting the true reflectivity of these images and of appropriate priors for the unknown model parameters. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the model parameters and the image of true reflectivity while classifying images according to the distribution of their reflectivity. Precisely, a Metropolis-whitin-Gibbs sampler is investigated to sample the posterior distribution of the Bayesian model associated with RCM images and to build estimators of its parameters, including labels indicating the class of each RCM image. The resulting algorithm is applied to synthetic data and to real images from a clinical study containing healthy and lentigo patients.

1505.05117v1	We present Vector-Space Markov Random Fields (VS-MRFs), a novel class of undirected graphical models where each variable can belong to an arbitrary vector space. VS-MRFs generalize a recent line of work on scalar-valued, uni-parameter exponential family and mixed graphical models, thereby greatly broadening the class of exponential families available (e.g., allowing multinomial and Dirichlet distributions). Specifically, VS-MRFs are the joint graphical model distributions where the node-conditional distributions belong to generic exponential families with general vector space domains. We also present a sparsistent $M$-estimator for learning our class of MRFs that recovers the correct set of edges with high probability. We validate our approach via a set of synthetic data experiments as well as a real-world case study of over four million foods from the popular diet tracking app MyFitnessPal. Our results demonstrate that our algorithm performs well empirically and that VS-MRFs are capable of capturing and highlighting interesting structure in complex, real-world data. All code for our algorithm is open source and publicly available.	Vector-Space Markov Random Fields via Exponential Families
1402.4884v2	"""Deep Learning"" methods attempt to learn generic features in an unsupervised fashion from a large unlabelled data set. These generic features should perform as well as the best hand crafted features for any learning problem that makes use of this data. We provide a definition of generic features, characterize when it is possible to learn them and provide methods closely related to the autoencoder and deep belief network of deep learning. In order to do so we use the notion of deficiency and illustrate its value in studying certain general learning problems."	Le Cam meets LeCun: Deficiency and Generic Feature Learning
1101.0317v1	In the applications related to airborne radars, simulation has always played an important role. This is mainly because of the two fold reason of the unavailability of desired data and the difficulty associated with the collection of data under controlled environment. A simple example will be regarding the collection of pure multipolar radar data. Even after phenomenal development in the field of radar hardware design and signal processing, till now the collection of pure multipolar data is a challenge for the radar system designers. Till very recently, the power of computer simulation of radar signal return was available to a very selected few. This was because of the heavy cost associated with some of the main line electro magnetic (EM) simulators for radar signal simulation, and secondly because many such EM simulators are for restricted marketting. However, because of the fast progress made in the field of EM simulation, many of the current generic EM simulators can be used to simulate radar returns from realistic targets. The current article expounds the steps towards generating a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image database of ground targets, using a eneric EM g simulator. It also demonstrates by the help of some example images, the quality of the SAR mage generated i using a general purpose EM simulator.	Generation of SAR Image for Real-life Objects using General Purpose EM  Simulators
1709.02855v1	We propose a new framework for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) on truncated probability distributions with smooth underlying density functions. Traditional HMC requires computing the gradient of potential function associated with the target distribution, and therefore does not perform its full power on truncated distributions due to lack of continuity and differentiability. In our framework, we introduce a sharp sigmoid factor in the density function to approximate the probability drop at the truncation boundary. The target potential function is approximated by a new potential which smoothly extends to the entire sample space. HMC is then performed on the approximate potential. While our method is easy to implement and applies to a wide range of problems, it also achieves comparable computational efficiency on various sampling tasks compared to other baseline methods. RBHMC also gives rise to a new approach for Bayesian inference on constrained spaces.	Roll-back Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
1403.7304v3	We connect shift-invariant characteristic kernels to infinitely divisible distributions on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Characteristic kernels play an important role in machine learning applications with their kernel means to distinguish any two probability measures. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we show, using the L\'evy-Khintchine formula, that any shift-invariant kernel given by a bounded, continuous and symmetric probability density function (pdf) of an infinitely divisible distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is characteristic. We also present some closure property of such characteristic kernels under addition, pointwise product, and convolution. Second, in developing various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to compute the following values: (i) kernel mean values $m_P(x)$, $x \in \mathcal{X}$, and (ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products ${\left\langle m_P, m_Q \right\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}}$, for probability measures $P, Q$. If $P, Q$, and kernel $k$ are Gaussians, then computation (i) and (ii) results in Gaussian pdfs that is tractable. We generalize this Gaussian combination to more general cases in the class of infinitely divisible distributions. We then introduce a {\it conjugate} kernel and {\it convolution trick}, so that the above (i) and (ii) have the same pdf form, expecting tractable computation at least in some cases. As specific instances, we explore $\alpha$-stable distributions and a rich class of generalized hyperbolic distributions, where the Laplace, Cauchy and Student-t distributions are included.

0905.2236v1	Percolation on complex networks has been used to study computer viruses, epidemics, and other casual processes. Here, we present conditions for the existence of a network specific, observation dependent, phase transition in the updated posterior of node states resulting from actively monitoring the network. Since traditional percolation thresholds are derived using observation independent Markov chains, the threshold of the posterior should more accurately model the true phase transition of a network, as the updated posterior more accurately tracks the process. These conditions should provide insight into modeling the dynamic response of the updated posterior to active intervention and control policies while monitoring large complex networks.

1203.3507v1	Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation of functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately, exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large dataset into a small set of basis points. Among them, two state-of-the-art methods are sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) (Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006) and variablesigma GP (VSGP) Walder et al. (2008), which generalizes SPGP and allows each basis point to have its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. In this paper, we propose a new sparse GP framework that uses expectation propagation to directly approximate general GP likelihoods using a sparse and smooth basis. It includes both SPGP and VSGP for regression as special cases. Plus as an EP algorithm, it inherits the ability to process data online. As a particular choice of approximating family, we blur each basis point with a Gaussian distribution that has a full covariance matrix representing the data distribution around that basis point; as a result, we can summarize local data manifold information with a small set of basis points. Our experiments demonstrate that this framework outperforms previous GP classification methods on benchmark datasets in terms of minimizing divergence to the non-sparse GP solution as well as lower misclassification rate.	Sparse-posterior Gaussian Processes for general likelihoods
1202.2476v1	High-dimensional tensors or multi-way data are becoming prevalent in areas such as biomedical imaging, chemometrics, networking and bibliometrics. Traditional approaches to finding lower dimensional representations of tensor data include flattening the data and applying matrix factorizations such as principal components analysis (PCA) or employing tensor decompositions such as the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker decompositions. The former can lose important structure in the data, while the latter Higher-Order PCA (HOPCA) methods can be problematic in high-dimensions with many irrelevant features. We introduce frameworks for sparse tensor factorizations or Sparse HOPCA based on heuristic algorithmic approaches and by solving penalized optimization problems related to the CP decomposition. Extensions of these approaches lead to methods for general regularized tensor factorizations, multi-way Functional HOPCA and generalizations of HOPCA for structured data. We illustrate the utility of our methods for dimension reduction, feature selection, and signal recovery on simulated data and multi-dimensional microarrays and functional MRIs.

0910.3099v1	We consider Bayesian analysis of a class of multiple changepoint models. While there are a variety of efficient ways to analyse these models if the parameters associated with each segment are independent, there are few general approaches for models where the parameters are dependent. Under the assumption that the dependence is Markov, we propose an efficient online algorithm for sampling from an approximation to the posterior distribution of the number and position of the changepoints. In a simulation study, we show that the approximation introduced is negligible. We illustrate the power of our approach through fitting piecewise polynomial models to data, under a model which allows for either continuity or discontinuity of the underlying curve at each changepoint. This method is competitive with, or out-performs, other methods for inferring curves from noisy data; and uniquely it allows for inference of the locations of discontinuities in the underlying curve.

1708.06935v1	We present a novel approach for estimating conditional probability tables, based on a joint, rather than independent, estimate of the conditional distributions belonging to the same table. We derive exact analytical expressions for the estimators and we analyse their properties both analytically and via simulation. We then apply this method to the estimation of parameters in a Bayesian network. Given the structure of the network, the proposed approach better estimates the joint distribution and significantly improves the classification performance with respect to traditional approaches.	Hierarchical Multinomial-Dirichlet model for the estimation of  conditional probability tables
1108.2228v3	We present a method to estimate block membership of nodes in a random graph generated by a stochastic blockmodel. We use an embedding procedure motivated by the random dot product graph model, a particular example of the latent position model. The embedding associates each node with a vector; these vectors are clustered via minimization of a square error criterion. We prove that this method is consistent for assigning nodes to blocks, as only a negligible number of nodes will be mis-assigned. We prove consistency of the method for directed and undirected graphs. The consistent block assignment makes possible consistent parameter estimation for a stochastic blockmodel. We extend the result in the setting where the number of blocks grows slowly with the number of nodes. Our method is also computationally feasible even for very large graphs. We compare our method to Laplacian spectral clustering through analysis of simulated data and a graph derived from Wikipedia documents.

1708.05200v1	Malaria is a serious infectious disease that is responsible for over half million deaths yearly worldwide. The major cause of these mortalities is late or inaccurate diagnosis. Manual microscopy is currently considered as the dominant diagnostic method for malaria. However, it is time consuming and prone to human errors. The aim of this paper is to automate the diagnosis process and minimize the human intervention. We have developed the hardware and software for a cost-efficient malaria diagnostic system. This paper describes the manufactured hardware and also proposes novel software to handle parasite detection and life-stage identification. A motorized microscope is developed to take images from Giemsa-stained blood smears. A patch-based unsupervised statistical clustering algorithm is proposed which offers a novel method for classification of different regions within blood images. The proposed method provides better robustness against different imaging settings. The core of the proposed algorithm is a model called Mixture of Independent Component Analysis. A manifold based optimization method is proposed that facilitates the application of the model for high dimensional data usually acquired in medical microscopy. The method was tested on 600 blood slides with various imaging conditions. The speed of the method is higher than current supervised systems while its accuracy is comparable to or better than them.

1603.01912v3	Partition functions of probability distributions are important quantities for model evaluation and comparisons. We present a new method to compute partition functions of complex and multimodal distributions. Such distributions are often sampled using simulated tempering, which augments the target space with an auxiliary inverse temperature variable. Our method exploits the multinomial probability law of the inverse temperatures, and provides estimates of the partition function in terms of a simple quotient of Rao-Blackwellized marginal inverse temperature probability estimates, which are updated while sampling. We show that the method has interesting connections with several alternative popular methods, and offers some significant advantages. In particular, we empirically find that the new method provides more accurate estimates than Annealed Importance Sampling when calculating partition functions of large Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM); moreover, the method is sufficiently accurate to track training and validation log-likelihoods during learning of RBMs, at minimal computational cost.	Partition Functions from Rao-Blackwellized Tempered Sampling
1703.08251v1	There is growing interest in applying machine learning methods to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Across different institutions, however, EMR quality can vary widely. This work investigated the impact of this disparity on the performance of three advanced machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and recurrent neural network. The EMR disparity was emulated using different permutations of the EMR collected at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU). The algorithms were trained using patients from the PICU to predict in-ICU mortality for patients in a held out set of PICU and CTICU patients. The disparate patient populations between the PICU and CTICU provide an estimate of generalization errors across different ICUs. We quantified and evaluated the generalization of these algorithms on varying EMR size, input types, and fidelity of data.	The Dependence of Machine Learning on Electronic Medical Record Quality
0910.1013v1	"This paper reviews the functional aspects of statistical learning theory. The main point under consideration is the nature of the hypothesis set when no prior information is available but data. Within this framework we first discuss about the hypothesis set: it is a vectorial space, it is a set of pointwise defined functions, and the evaluation functional on this set is a continuous mapping. Based on these principles an original theory is developed generalizing the notion of reproduction kernel Hilbert space to non hilbertian sets. Then it is shown that the hypothesis set of any learning machine has to be a generalized reproducing set. Therefore, thanks to a general ""representer theorem"", the solution of the learning problem is still a linear combination of a kernel. Furthermore, a way to design these kernels is given. To illustrate this framework some examples of such reproducing sets and kernels are given."	Functional learning through kernels
1105.4585v1	We develop a coherent framework for integrative simultaneous analysis of the exploration-exploitation and model order selection trade-offs. We improve over our preceding results on the same subject (Seldin et al., 2011) by combining PAC-Bayesian analysis with Bernstein-type inequality for martingales. Such a combination is also of independent interest for studies of multiple simultaneously evolving martingales.	PAC-Bayesian Analysis of the Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off
1711.08861v1	A modern aircraft may require on the order of thousands of custom shims to fill gaps between structural components in the airframe that arise due to manufacturing tolerances adding up across large structures. These shims are necessary to eliminate gaps, maintain structural performance, and minimize pull-down forces required to bring the aircraft into engineering nominal configuration for peak aerodynamic efficiency. Gap filling is a time-consuming process, involving either expensive by-hand inspection or computations on vast quantities of measurement data from increasingly sophisticated metrology equipment. Either case amounts to significant delays in production, with much of the time spent in the critical path of aircraft assembly. This work presents an alternative strategy for predictive shimming, based on machine learning and sparse sensing to first learn gap distributions from historical data, and then design optimized sparse sensing strategies to streamline data collection and processing. This new approach is based on the assumption that patterns exist in shim distributions across aircraft, which may be mined and used to reduce the burden of data collection and processing in future aircraft. Specifically, robust principal component analysis is used to extract low-dimensional patterns in the gap measurements while rejecting outliers. Next, optimized sparse sensors are obtained that are most informative about the dimensions of a new aircraft in these low-dimensional principal components. We demonstrate the success of the proposed approach, called PIXel Identification Despite Uncertainty in Sensor Technology (PIXI-DUST), on historical production data from 54 representative Boeing commercial aircraft. Our algorithm successfully predicts $99\%$ of shim gaps within the desired measurement tolerance using $3\%$ of the laser scan points typically required; all results are cross-validated.

1302.0256v1	Identifying homogeneous subgroups of variables can be challenging in high dimensional data analysis with highly correlated predictors. We propose a new method called Hexagonal Operator for Regression with Shrinkage and Equality Selection, HORSES for short, that simultaneously selects positively correlated variables and identifies them as predictive clusters. This is achieved via a constrained least-squares problem with regularization that consists of a linear combination of an L_1 penalty for the coefficients and another L_1 penalty for pairwise differences of the coefficients. This specification of the penalty function encourages grouping of positively correlated predictors combined with a sparsity solution. We construct an efficient algorithm to implement the HORSES procedure. We show via simulation that the proposed method outperforms other variable selection methods in terms of prediction error and parsimony. The technique is demonstrated on two data sets, a small data set from analysis of soil in Appalachia, and a high dimensional data set from a near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy study, showing the flexibility of the methodology.

1512.07960v1	The histogram method is a powerful non-parametric approach for estimating the probability density function of a continuous variable. But the construction of a histogram, compared to the parametric approaches, demands a large number of observations to capture the underlying density function. Thus it is not suitable for analyzing a sparse data set, a collection of units with a small size of data. In this paper, by employing the probabilistic topic model, we develop a novel Bayesian approach to alleviating the sparsity problem in the conventional histogram estimation. Our method estimates a unit's density function as a mixture of basis histograms, in which the number of bins for each basis, as well as their heights, is determined automatically. The estimation procedure is performed by using the fast and easy-to-implement collapsed Gibbs sampling. We apply the proposed method to synthetic data, showing that it performs well.

1707.05922v1	We propose a simple method that combines neural networks and Gaussian processes. The proposed method can estimate the uncertainty of outputs and flexibly adjust target functions where training data exist, which are advantages of Gaussian processes. The proposed method can also achieve high generalization performance for unseen input configurations, which is an advantage of neural networks. With the proposed method, neural networks are used for the mean functions of Gaussian processes. We present a scalable stochastic inference procedure, where sparse Gaussian processes are inferred by stochastic variational inference, and the parameters of neural networks and kernels are estimated by stochastic gradient descent methods, simultaneously. We use two real-world spatio-temporal data sets to demonstrate experimentally that the proposed method achieves better uncertainty estimation and generalization performance than neural networks and Gaussian processes.

1705.04194v1	Many unsupervised kernel methods rely on the estimation of the kernel covariance operator (kernel CO) or kernel cross-covariance operator (kernel CCO). Both kernel CO and kernel CCO are sensitive to contaminated data, even when bounded positive definite kernels are used. To the best of our knowledge, there are few well-founded robust kernel methods for statistical unsupervised learning. In addition, while the influence function (IF) of an estimator can characterize its robustness, asymptotic properties and standard error, the IF of a standard kernel canonical correlation analysis (standard kernel CCA) has not been derived yet. To fill this gap, we first propose a robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and a robust kernel cross-covariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we derive the IF for robust kernel CCO and standard kernel CCA. Using the IF of the standard kernel CCA, we can detect influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method based on the robust kernel CO and the robust kernel CCO, called {\bf robust kernel CCA}, which is less sensitive to noise than the standard kernel CCA. The introduced principles can also be applied to many other kernel methods involving kernel CO or kernel CCO. Our experiments on synthesized data and imaging genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed IF of standard kernel CCA can identify outliers. It is also seen that the proposed robust kernel CCA method performs better for ideal and contaminated data than the standard kernel CCA.

1802.06307v1	Many popular dimensionality reduction procedures have out-of-sample extensions, which allow a practitioner to apply a learned embedding to observations not seen in the initial training sample. In this work, we consider the problem of obtaining an out-of-sample extension for the adjacency spectral embedding, a procedure for embedding the vertices of a graph into Euclidean space. We present two different approaches to this problem, one based on a least-squares objective and the other based on a maximum-likelihood formulation. We show that if the graph of interest is drawn according to a certain latent position model called a random dot product graph, then both of these out-of-sample extensions estimate the true latent position of the out-of-sample vertex with the same error rate. Further, we prove a central limit theorem for the least-squares-based extension, showing that the estimate is asymptotically normal about the truth in the large-graph limit.

1706.06178v1	We propose a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model for prediction- and information extraction tasks with an efficient inference scheme. It models categorical-valued time series that exhibit dynamics from multiple underlying patterns (e.g. user behavior traces). We simplify the idea of capturing these patterns by hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs) - and extend the existing approaches by the additional representation of structural information. Our empirical results are based on both synthetic- and real world data. They indicate that the results are easily interpretable, and that the model excels at segmentation and prediction performance: it successfully identifies the generating patterns and can be used for effective prediction of future observations.

1011.6086v1	Statistical models of natural stimuli provide an important tool for researchers in the fields of machine learning and computational neuroscience. A canonical way to quantitatively assess and compare the performance of statistical models is given by the likelihood. One class of statistical models which has recently gained increasing popularity and has been applied to a variety of complex data are deep belief networks. Analyses of these models, however, have been typically limited to qualitative analyses based on samples due to the computationally intractable nature of the model likelihood. Motivated by these circumstances, the present article provides a consistent estimator for the likelihood that is both computationally tractable and simple to apply in practice. Using this estimator, a deep belief network which has been suggested for the modeling of natural image patches is quantitatively investigated and compared to other models of natural image patches. Contrary to earlier claims based on qualitative results, the results presented in this article provide evidence that the model under investigation is not a particularly good model for natural images	In All Likelihood, Deep Belief Is Not Enough

1502.03466v1	For the challenging task of modeling multivariate time series, we propose a new class of models that use dependent Mat\'ern processes to capture the underlying structure of data, explain their interdependencies, and predict their unknown values. Although similar models have been proposed in the econometric, statistics, and machine learning literature, our approach has several advantages that distinguish it from existing methods: 1) it is flexible to provide high prediction accuracy, yet its complexity is controlled to avoid overfitting; 2) its interpretability separates it from black-box methods; 3) finally, its computational efficiency makes it scalable for high-dimensional time series. In this paper, we use several simulated and real data sets to illustrate these advantages. We will also briefly discuss some extensions of our model.

1201.0959v1	Functional data analysis involves data described by regular functions rather than by a finite number of real valued variables. While some robust data analysis methods can be applied directly to the very high dimensional vectors obtained from a fine grid sampling of functional data, all methods benefit from a prior simplification of the functions that reduces the redundancy induced by the regularity. In this paper we propose to use a clustering approach that targets variables rather than individual to design a piecewise constant representation of a set of functions. The contiguity constraint induced by the functional nature of the variables allows a polynomial complexity algorithm to give the optimal solution.

This paper provides a gentle introduction to non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks: Using an infinite mixture model as running example we go through the steps of deriving the model as an infinite limit of a finite parametric model, inferring the model parameters by Markov chain Monte Carlo, and checking the model's fit and predictive performance. We explain how advanced non-parametric models for complex networks can be derived and point out relevant literature.	Non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks
1512.03444v1	Recursive partitioning approaches producing tree-like models are a long standing staple of predictive modeling, in the last decade mostly as ``sub-learners'' within state of the art ensemble methods like Boosting and Random Forest. However, a fundamental flaw in the partitioning (or splitting) rule of commonly used tree building methods precludes them from treating different types of variables equally. This most clearly manifests in these methods' inability to properly utilize categorical variables with a large number of categories, which are ubiquitous in the new age of big data. Such variables can often be very informative, but current tree methods essentially leave us a choice of either not using them, or exposing our models to severe overfitting. We propose a conceptual framework to splitting using leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation for selecting the splitting variable, then performing a regular split (in our case, following CART's approach) for the selected variable. The most important consequence of our approach is that categorical variables with many categories can be safely used in tree building and are only chosen if they contribute to predictive power. We demonstrate in extensive simulation and real data analysis that our novel splitting approach significantly improves the performance of both single tree models and ensemble methods that utilize trees. Importantly, we design an algorithm for LOO splitting variable selection which under reasonable assumptions does not increase the overall computational complexity compared to CART for two-class classification. For regression tasks, our approach carries an increased computational burden, replacing a O(log(n)) factor in CART splitting rule search with an O(n) term.

1111.1802v5	We develop a Bayesian nonparametric approach to a general family of latent class problems in which individuals can belong simultaneously to multiple classes and where each class can be exhibited multiple times by an individual. We introduce a combinatorial stochastic process known as the negative binomial process (NBP) as an infinite-dimensional prior appropriate for such problems. We show that the NBP is conjugate to the beta process, and we characterize the posterior distribution under the beta-negative binomial process (BNBP) and hierarchical models based on the BNBP (the HBNBP). We study the asymptotic properties of the BNBP and develop a three-parameter extension of the BNBP that exhibits power-law behavior. We derive MCMC algorithms for posterior inference under the HBNBP, and we present experiments using these algorithms in the domains of image segmentation, object recognition, and document analysis.	Combinatorial clustering and the beta negative binomial process
1506.04138v1	The latent block model (LBM) is a flexible probabilistic tool to describe interactions between node sets in bipartite networks, but it does not account for interactions of time varying intensity between nodes in unknown classes. In this paper we propose a non stationary temporal extension of the LBM that clusters simultaneously the two node sets of a bipartite network and constructs classes of time intervals on which interactions are stationary. The number of clusters as well as the membership to classes are obtained by maximizing the exact complete-data integrated likelihood relying on a greedy search approach. Experiments on simulated and real data are carried out in order to assess the proposed methodology.	Exact ICL maximization in a non-stationary time extension of the latent  block model for dynamic networks
1110.4304v3	Echo state network (ESN) is viewed as a temporal non-orthogonal expansion with pseudo-random parameters. Such expansions naturally give rise to regressors of various relevance to a teacher output. We illustrate that often only a certain amount of the generated echo-regressors effectively explain the variance of the teacher output and also that sole local regularization is not able to provide in-depth information concerning the importance of the generated regressors. The importance is therefore determined by a joint calculation of the individual variance contributions and Bayesian relevance using locally regularized orthogonal forward regression (LROFR) algorithm. This information can be advantageously used in a variety of ways for an in-depth analysis of an ESN structure and its state-space parameters in relation to the unknown dynamics of the underlying problem. We present locally regularized linear readout built using LROFR. The readout may have a different dimensionality than an ESN model itself, and besides improving robustness and accuracy of an ESN it relates the echo-regressors to different features of the training data and may determine what type of an additional readout is suitable for a task at hand. Moreover, as flexibility of the linear readout has limitations and might sometimes be insufficient for certain tasks, we also present a radial basis function (RBF) readout built using LROFR. It is a flexible and parsimonious readout with excellent generalization abilities and is a viable alternative to readouts based on a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) or an RBF net built using relevance vector machine (RVM).

1711.02887v1	We establish the consistency of an algorithm of Mondrian Forests, a randomized classification algorithm that can be implemented online. First, we amend the original Mondrian Forest algorithm, that considers a fixed lifetime parameter. Indeed, the fact that this parameter is fixed hinders the statistical consistency of the original procedure. Our modified Mondrian Forest algorithm grows trees with increasing lifetime parameters $\lambda_n$, and uses an alternative updating rule, allowing to work also in an online fashion. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis establishing simple conditions for consistency. Our theoretical analysis also exhibits a surprising fact: our algorithm achieves the minimax rate (optimal rate) for the estimation of a Lipschitz regression function, which is a strong extension of previous results to an arbitrary dimension.	Universal consistency and minimax rates for online Mondrian Forests
1611.00555v1	Kernel dependence measures yield accurate estimates of nonlinear relations between random variables, and they are also endorsed with solid theoretical properties and convergence rates. Besides, the empirical estimates are easy to compute in closed form just involving linear algebra operations. However, they are hampered by two important problems: the high computational cost involved, as two kernel matrices of the sample size have to be computed and stored, and the interpretability of the measure, which remains hidden behind the implicit feature map. We here address these two issues. We introduce the Sensitivity Maps (SMs) for the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Sensitivity maps allow us to explicitly analyze and visualize the relative relevance of both examples and features on the dependence measure. We also present the randomized HSIC (RHSIC) and its corresponding sensitivity maps to cope with large scale problems. We build upon the framework of random features and the Bochner's theorem to approximate the involved kernels in the canonical HSIC. The power of the RHSIC measure scales favourably with the number of samples, and it approximates HSIC and the sensitivity maps efficiently. Convergence bounds of both the measure and the sensitivity map are also provided. Our proposal is illustrated in synthetic examples, and challenging real problems of dependence estimation, feature selection, and causal inference from empirical data.	Sensitivity Maps of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
1802.05370v1	The paper presents a novel approach to direct covariance function learning for Bayesian optimisation, with particular emphasis on experimental design problems where an existing corpus of condensed knowledge is present. The method presented borrows techniques from reproducing kernel Banach space theory (specifically m-kernels) and leverages them to convert (or re-weight) existing covariance functions into new, problem-specific covariance functions. The key advantage of this approach is that rather than relying on the user to manually select (with some hyperparameter tuning and experimentation) an appropriate covariance function it constructs the covariance function to specifically match the problem at hand. The technique is demonstrated on two real-world problems - specifically alloy design and carbon-fibre manufacturing - as well as a selected test function.

1603.05060v1	Linear autoregressive models serve as basic representations of discrete time stochastic processes. Different attempts have been made to provide non-linear versions of the basic autoregressive process, including different versions based on kernel methods. Motivated by the powerful framework of Hilbert space embeddings of distributions, in this paper we apply this methodology for the kernel embedding of an autoregressive process of order $p$. By doing so, we provide a non-linear version of an autoregressive process, that shows increased performance over the linear model in highly complex time series. We use the method proposed for one-step ahead forecasting of different time-series, and compare its performance against other non-linear methods.	Short-term time series prediction using Hilbert space embeddings of  autoregressive processes
1701.02301v2	We propose a generic framework based on a new stochastic variance-reduced gradient descent algorithm for accelerating nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery. Starting from an appropriate initial estimator, our proposed algorithm performs projected gradient descent based on a novel semi-stochastic gradient specifically designed for low-rank matrix recovery. Based upon the mild restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions, we derive a projected notion of the restricted Lipschitz continuous gradient property, and prove that our algorithm enjoys linear convergence rate to the unknown low-rank matrix with an improved computational complexity. Moreover, our algorithm can be employed to both noiseless and noisy observations, where the optimal sample complexity and the minimax optimal statistical rate can be attained respectively. We further illustrate the superiority of our generic framework through several specific examples, both theoretically and experimentally.

1312.7750v1	Multi-task learning has shown to significantly enhance the performance of multiple related learning tasks in a variety of situations. We present the fused logistic regression, a sparse multi-task learning approach for binary classification. Specifically, we introduce sparsity inducing penalties over parameter differences of related logistic regression models to encode similarity across related tasks. The resulting joint learning task is cast into a form that lends itself to be efficiently optimized with a recursive variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers. We show results on synthetic data and describe the regime of settings where our multi-task approach achieves significant improvements over the single task learning approach and discuss the implications on applying the fused logistic regression in different real world settings.	A Fused Elastic Net Logistic Regression Model for Multi-Task Binary  Classification
1711.05615v1	The use of covariance kernels is ubiquitous in the field of spatial statistics. Kernels allow data to be mapped into high-dimensional feature spaces and can thus extend simple linear additive methods to nonlinear methods with higher order interactions. However, until recently, there has been a strong reliance on a limited class of stationary kernels such as the Matern or squared exponential, limiting the expressiveness of these modelling approaches. Recent machine learning research has focused on spectral representations to model arbitrary stationary kernels and introduced more general representations that include classes of nonstationary kernels. In this paper, we exploit the connections between Fourier feature representations, Gaussian processes and neural networks to generalise previous approaches and develop a simple and efficient framework to learn arbitrarily complex nonstationary kernel functions directly from the data, while taking care to avoid overfitting using state-of-the-art methods from deep learning. We highlight the very broad array of kernel classes that could be created within this framework. We apply this to a time series dataset and a remote sensing problem involving land surface temperature in Eastern Africa. We show that without increasing the computational or storage complexity, nonstationary kernels can be used to improve generalisation performance and provide more interpretable results.	Spatial Mapping with Gaussian Processes and Nonstationary Fourier  Features
1802.00243v1	We study a logistic model-based active learning procedure for binary classification problems, in which we adopt a batch subject selection strategy with a modified sequential experimental design method. Moreover, accompanying the proposed subject selection scheme, we simultaneously conduct a greedy variable selection procedure such that we can update the classification model with all labeled training subjects. The proposed algorithm repeatedly performs both subject and variable selection steps until a prefixed stopping criterion is reached. Our numerical results show that the proposed procedure has competitive performance, with smaller training size and a more compact model, comparing with that of the classifier trained with all variables and a full data set. We also apply the proposed procedure to a well-known wave data set (Breiman et al., 1984) to confirm the performance of our method.	Greedy Active Learning Algorithm for Logistic Regression Models
1406.4519v1	We present a technique for significantly speeding up Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Gradient Descent (GD), two widely used algorithms for tensor factorization. By exploiting properties of the Khatri-Rao product, we show how to efficiently address a computationally challenging sub-step of both algorithms. Our algorithm, DFacTo, only requires two sparse matrix-vector products and is easy to parallelize. DFacTo is not only scalable but also on average 4 to 10 times faster than competing algorithms on a variety of datasets. For instance, DFacTo only takes 480 seconds on 4 machines to perform one iteration of the ALS algorithm and 1,143 seconds to perform one iteration of the GD algorithm on a 6.5 million x 2.5 million x 1.5 million dimensional tensor with 1.2 billion non-zero entries.

1701.05672v1	Stability is an important aspect of a classification procedure because unstable predictions can potentially reduce users' trust in a classification system and also harm the reproducibility of scientific conclusions. The major goal of our work is to introduce a novel concept of classification instability, i.e., decision boundary instability (DBI), and incorporate it with the generalization error (GE) as a standard for selecting the most accurate and stable classifier. Specifically, we implement a two-stage algorithm: (i) initially select a subset of classifiers whose estimated GEs are not significantly different from the minimal estimated GE among all the candidate classifiers; (ii) the optimal classifier is chosen as the one achieving the minimal DBI among the subset selected in stage (i). This general selection principle applies to both linear and nonlinear classifiers. Large-margin classifiers are used as a prototypical example to illustrate the above idea. Our selection method is shown to be consistent in the sense that the optimal classifier simultaneously achieves the minimal GE and the minimal DBI. Various simulations and real examples further demonstrate the advantage of our method over several alternative approaches.	Stability Enhanced Large-Margin Classifier Selection
1603.06277v5	We propose a general modeling and inference framework that composes probabilistic graphical models with deep learning methods and combines their respective strengths. Our model family augments graphical structure in latent variables with neural network observation models. For inference, we extend variational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributions with recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components of these models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving a scalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, natural gradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick. We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application to mouse behavioral phenotyping.

1103.4998v1	The purpose of sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is to find the low-dimensional subspace of input features that is sufficient for predicting output values. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-free SDR method called sufficient component analysis (SCA), which is computationally more efficient than existing methods. In our method, a solution is computed by iteratively performing dependence estimation and maximization: Dependence estimation is analytically carried out by recently-proposed least-squares mutual information (LSMI), and dependence maximization is also analytically carried out by utilizing the Epanechnikov kernel. Through large-scale experiments on real-world image classification and audio tagging problems, the proposed method is shown to compare favorably with existing dimension reduction approaches.	Sufficient Component Analysis for Supervised Dimension Reduction
1710.01788v1	Inferring predictive maps between multiple input and multiple output variables or tasks has innumerable applications in data science. Multi-task learning attempts to learn the maps to several output tasks simultaneously with information sharing between them. We propose a novel multi-task learning framework for sparse linear regression, where a full task hierarchy is automatically inferred from the data, with the assumption that the task parameters follow a hierarchical tree structure. The leaves of the tree are the parameters for individual tasks, and the root is the global model that approximates all the tasks. We apply the proposed approach to develop and evaluate: (a) predictive models of plant traits using large-scale and automated remote sensing data, and (b) GWAS methodologies mapping such derived phenotypes in lieu of hand-measured traits. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to other methods, as well as the usefulness of discovering hierarchical groupings between tasks. Our results suggest that richer genetic mapping can indeed be obtained from the remote sensing data. In addition, our discovered groupings reveal interesting insights from a plant science perspective.

1406.6319v3	"A natural approach to analyze interaction data of form ""what-connects-to-what-when"" is to create a time-series (or rather a sequence) of graphs through temporal discretization (bandwidth selection) and spatial discretization (vertex contraction). Such discretization together with non-negative factorization techniques can be useful for obtaining clustering of graphs. Motivating application of performing clustering of graphs (as opposed to vertex clustering) can be found in neuroscience and in social network analysis, and it can also be used to enhance community detection (i.e., vertex clustering) by way of conditioning on the cluster labels. In this paper, we formulate a problem of clustering of graphs as a model selection problem. Our approach involves information criteria, non-negative matrix factorization and singular value thresholding, and we illustrate our techniques using real and simulated data."

1712.00481v1	In order to submit a claim to insurance companies, a doctor needs to code a patient encounter with both the diagnosis (ICDs) and procedures performed (CPTs) in an Electronic Health Record (EHR). Identifying and applying relevant procedures code is a cumbersome and time-consuming task as a doctor has to choose from around 13,000 procedure codes with no predefined one-to-one mapping. In this paper, we propose a state-of-the-art deep learning method for automatic and intelligent coding of procedures (CPTs) from the diagnosis codes (ICDs) entered by the doctor. Precisely, we cast the learning problem as a multi-label classification problem and use distributed representation to learn the input mapping of high-dimensional sparse ICDs codes. Our final model trained on 2.3 million claims is able to outperform existing rule-based probabilistic and association-rule mining based methods and has a recall of 90@3.

1203.3462v1	We introduce Gaussian Process Topic Models (GPTMs), a new family of topic models which can leverage a kernel among documents while extracting correlated topics. GPTMs can be considered a systematic generalization of the Correlated Topic Models (CTMs) using ideas from Gaussian Process (GP) based embedding. Since GPTMs work with both a topic covariance matrix and a document kernel matrix, learning GPTMs involves a novel component-solving a suitable Sylvester equation capturing both topic and document dependencies. The efficacy of GPTMs is demonstrated with experiments evaluating the quality of both topic modeling and embedding.	Gaussian Process Topic Models
1401.0086v2	We consider forward-backward greedy algorithms for solving sparse feature selection problems with general convex smooth functions. A state-of-the-art greedy method, the Forward-Backward greedy algorithm (FoBa-obj) requires to solve a large number of optimization problems, thus it is not scalable for large-size problems. The FoBa-gdt algorithm, which uses the gradient information for feature selection at each forward iteration, significantly improves the efficiency of FoBa-obj. In this paper, we systematically analyze the theoretical properties of both forward-backward greedy algorithms. Our main contributions are: 1) We derive better theoretical bounds than existing analyses regarding FoBa-obj for general smooth convex functions; 2) We show that FoBa-gdt achieves the same theoretical performance as FoBa-obj under the same condition: restricted strong convexity condition. Our new bounds are consistent with the bounds of a special case (least squares) and fills a previously existing theoretical gap for general convex smooth functions; 3) We show that the restricted strong convexity condition is satisfied if the number of independent samples is more than $\bar{k}\log d$ where $\bar{k}$ is the sparsity number and $d$ is the dimension of the variable; 4) We apply FoBa-gdt (with the conditional random field objective) to the sensor selection problem for human indoor activity recognition and our results show that FoBa-gdt outperforms other methods (including the ones based on forward greedy selection and L1-regularization).	Forward-Backward Greedy Algorithms for General Convex Smooth Functions  over A Cardinality Constraint
1511.09422v2	We present an information-theoretic framework for solving global black-box optimization problems that also have black-box constraints. Of particular interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the constraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic and real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require balancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of PESC and in the actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality approach and develop partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization.

1103.5201v2	We theoretically investigate the convergence rate and support consistency (i.e., correctly identifying the subset of non-zero coefficients in the large sample limit) of multiple kernel learning (MKL). We focus on MKL with block-l1 regularization (inducing sparse kernel combination), block-l2 regularization (inducing uniform kernel combination), and elastic-net regularization (including both block-l1 and block-l2 regularization). For the case where the true kernel combination is sparse, we show a sharper convergence rate of the block-l1 and elastic-net MKL methods than the existing rate for block-l1 MKL. We further show that elastic-net MKL requires a milder condition for being consistent than block-l1 MKL. For the case where the optimal kernel combination is not exactly sparse, we prove that elastic-net MKL can achieve a faster convergence rate than the block-l1 and block-l2 MKL methods by carefully controlling the balance between the block-l1and block-l2 regularizers. Thus, our theoretical results overall suggest the use of elastic-net regularization in MKL.

1606.03865v3	This paper considers the quantification of the prediction performance in Gaussian process regression. The standard approach is to base the prediction error bars on the theoretical predictive variance, which is a lower bound on the mean square-error (MSE). This approach, however, does not take into account that the statistical model is learned from the data. We show that this omission leads to a systematic underestimation of the prediction errors. Starting from a generalization of the Cram\'er-Rao bound, we derive a more accurate MSE bound which provides a measure of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes. The improved bound is easily computed and we illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples. of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes and illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples.

1102.3074v3	Variables in many massive high-dimensional data sets are structured, arising for example from measurements on a regular grid as in imaging and time series or from spatial-temporal measurements as in climate studies. Classical multivariate techniques ignore these structural relationships often resulting in poor performance. We propose a generalization of the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal components analysis (PCA) that is appropriate for massive data sets with structured variables or known two-way dependencies. By finding the best low rank approximation of the data with respect to a transposable quadratic norm, our decomposition, entitled the Generalized least squares Matrix Decomposition (GMD), directly accounts for structural relationships. As many variables in high-dimensional settings are often irrelevant or noisy, we also regularize our matrix decomposition by adding two-way penalties to encourage sparsity or smoothness. We develop fast computational algorithms using our methods to perform generalized PCA (GPCA), sparse GPCA, and functional GPCA on massive data sets. Through simulations and a whole brain functional MRI example we demonstrate the utility of our methodology for dimension reduction, signal recovery, and feature selection with high-dimensional structured data.	A Generalized Least Squares Matrix Decomposition
1703.01488v1	Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.	Autoencoding Variational Inference For Topic Models
1705.07220v3	The present work deals with active sampling of graph nodes representing training data for binary classification. The graph may be given or constructed using similarity measures among nodal features. Leveraging the graph for classification builds on the premise that labels across neighboring nodes are correlated according to a categorical Markov random field (MRF). This model is further relaxed to a Gaussian (G)MRF with labels taking continuous values - an approximation that not only mitigates the combinatorial complexity of the categorical model, but also offers optimal unbiased soft predictors of the unlabeled nodes. The proposed sampling strategy is based on querying the node whose label disclosure is expected to inflict the largest change on the GMRF, and in this sense it is the most informative on average. Such a strategy subsumes several measures of expected model change, including uncertainty sampling, variance minimization, and sampling based on the $\Sigma-$optimality criterion. A simple yet effective heuristic is also introduced for increasing the exploration capabilities of the sampler, and reducing bias of the resultant classifier, by taking into account the confidence on the model label predictions. The novel sampling strategies are based on quantities that are readily available without the need for model retraining, rendering them computationally efficient and scalable to large graphs. Numerical tests using synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve accuracy that is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art even at reduced runtime.

1309.3699v1	We provide a formulation for Local Support Vector Machines (LSVMs) that generalizes previous formulations, and brings out the explicit connections to local polynomial learning used in nonparametric estimation literature. We investigate the simplest type of LSVMs called Local Linear Support Vector Machines (LLSVMs). For the first time we establish conditions under which LLSVMs make Bayes consistent predictions at each test point $x_0$. We also establish rates at which the local risk of LLSVMs converges to the minimum value of expected local risk at each point $x_0$. Using stability arguments we establish generalization error bounds for LLSVMs.	Local Support Vector Machines:Formulation and Analysis
1710.03276v1	Identifying changes in the generative process of sequential data, known as changepoint detection, has become an increasingly important topic for a wide variety of fields. A recently developed approach, which we call EXact Online Bayesian Changepoint Detection (EXO), has shown reasonable results with efficient computation for real time updates. However, when the changes are relatively small, EXO starts to have difficulty in detecting changepoints accurately. We propose a new algorithm called $\ell$-Lag EXact Online Bayesian Changepoint Detection (LEXO-$\ell$), which improves the accuracy of the detection by incorporating $\ell$ time lags in the inference. We prove that LEXO-1 finds the exact posterior distribution for the current run length and can be computed efficiently, with extension to arbitrary lag. Additionally, we show that LEXO-1 performs better than EXO in an extensive simulation study; this study is extended to higher order lags to illustrate the performance of the generalized methodology. Lastly, we illustrate applicability with two real world data examples comparing EXO and LEXO-1.	Lagged Exact Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection
1202.5514v2	This paper deals with the binary classification task when the target class has the lower probability of occurrence. In such situation, it is not possible to build a powerful classifier by using standard methods such as logistic regression, classification tree, discriminant analysis, etc. To overcome this short-coming of these methods which yield classifiers with low sensibility, we tackled the classification problem here through an approach based on the association rules learning. This approach has the advantage of allowing the identification of the patterns that are well correlated with the target class. Association rules learning is a well known method in the area of data-mining. It is used when dealing with large database for unsupervised discovery of local patterns that expresses hidden relationships between input variables. In considering association rules from a supervised learning point of view, a relevant set of weak classifiers is obtained from which one derives a classifier that performs well.	Classification approach based on association rules mining for unbalanced  data
1602.08418v1	In this paper, we present a framework for fitting multivariate Hawkes processes for large-scale problems both in the number of events in the observed history $n$ and the number of event types $d$ (i.e. dimensions). The proposed Low-Rank Hawkes Process (LRHP) framework introduces a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix that allows to perform the nonparametric learning of the $d^2$ triggering kernels using at most $O(ndr^2)$ operations, where $r$ is the rank of the approximation ($r \ll d,n$). This comes as a major improvement to the existing state-of-the-art inference algorithms that are in $O(nd^2)$. Furthermore, the low-rank approximation allows LRHP to learn representative patterns of interaction between event types, which may be valuable for the analysis of such complex processes in real world datasets. The efficiency and scalability of our approach is illustrated with numerical experiments on simulated as well as real datasets.	Multivariate Hawkes Processes for Large-scale Inference
1702.06525v3	We propose a unified framework to solve general low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery problems based on matrix factorization, which covers a broad family of objective functions satisfying the restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions. Based on projected gradient descent and the double thresholding operator, our proposed generic algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unknown low-rank and sparse matrices at a locally linear rate, while matching the best-known robustness guarantee (i.e., tolerance for sparsity). At the core of our theory is a novel structural Lipschitz gradient condition for low-rank plus sparse matrices, which is essential for proving the linear convergence rate of our algorithm, and we believe is of independent interest to prove fast rates for general superposition-structured models. We illustrate the application of our framework through two concrete examples: robust matrix sensing and robust PCA. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory.

1105.5332v3	Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a class of projective algorithms traditionally used in Euclidean space to produce two- or three-dimensional visualizations of datasets of multidimensional points or point distances. More recently however, several authors have pointed out that for certain datasets, hyperbolic target space may provide a better fit than Euclidean space. In this paper we develop PD-MDS, a metric MDS algorithm designed specifically for the Poincare disk (PD) model of the hyperbolic plane. Emphasizing the importance of proceeding from first principles in spite of the availability of various black box optimizers, our construction is based on an elementary hyperbolic line search and reveals numerous particulars that need to be carefully addressed when implementing this as well as more sophisticated iterative optimization methods in a hyperbolic space model.

1112.2319v1	Unbalanced data arises in many learning tasks such as clustering of multi-class data, hierarchical divisive clustering and semisupervised learning. Graph-based approaches are popular tools for these problems. Graph construction is an important aspect of graph-based learning. We show that graph-based algorithms can fail for unbalanced data for many popular graphs such as k-NN, \epsilon-neighborhood and full-RBF graphs. We propose a novel graph construction technique that encodes global statistical information into node degrees through a ranking scheme. The rank of a data sample is an estimate of its p-value and is proportional to the total number of data samples with smaller density. This ranking scheme serves as a surrogate for density; can be reliably estimated; and indicates whether a data sample is close to valleys/modes. This rank-modulated degree(RMD) scheme is able to significantly sparsify the graph near valleys and provides an adaptive way to cope with unbalanced data. We then theoretically justify our method through limit cut analysis. Unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

0803.0392v2	This paper proposes a novel multiscale estimator for the integrated volatility of an Ito process, in the presence of market microstructure noise (observation error). The multiscale structure of the observed process is represented frequency-by-frequency and the concept of the multiscale ratio is introduced to quantify the bias in the realized integrated volatility due to the observation error. The multiscale ratio is estimated from a single sample path, and a frequency-by-frequency bias correction procedure is proposed, which simultaneously reduces variance. We extend the method to include correlated observation errors and provide the implied time domain form of the estimation procedure. The new method is implemented to estimate the integrated volatility for the Heston and other models, and the improved performance of our method over existing methods is illustrated by simulation studies.

0902.3619v4	"The starting point of this article is the question ""How to retrieve fingerprints of rhythm in written texts?"" We address this problem in the case of Brazilian and European Portuguese. These two dialects of Modern Portuguese share the same lexicon and most of the sentences they produce are superficially identical. Yet they are conjectured, on linguistic grounds, to implement different rhythms. We show that this linguistic question can be formulated as a problem of model selection in the class of variable length Markov chains. To carry on this approach, we compare texts from European and Brazilian Portuguese. These texts are previously encoded according to some basic rhythmic features of the sentences which can be automatically retrieved. This is an entirely new approach from the linguistic point of view. Our statistical contribution is the introduction of the smallest maximizer criterion which is a constant free procedure for model selection. As a by-product, this provides a solution for the problem of optimal choice of the penalty constant when using the BIC to select a variable length Markov chain. Besides proving the consistency of the smallest maximizer criterion when the sample size diverges, we also make a simulation study comparing our approach with both the standard BIC selection and the Peres-Shields order estimation. Applied to the linguistic sample constituted for our case study, the smallest maximizer criterion assigns different context-tree models to the two dialects of Portuguese. The features of the selected models are compatible with current conjectures discussed in the linguistic literature."	Context tree selection and linguistic rhythm retrieval from written  texts
1512.01286v1	Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters.	Adjusting for Chance Clustering Comparison Measures
1709.05216v1	"We consider the problem of sequentially making decisions that are rewarded by ""successes"" and ""failures"" which can be predicted through an unknown relationship that depends on a partially controllable vector of attributes for each instance. The learner takes an active role in selecting samples from the instance pool. The goal is to maximize the probability of success in either offline (training) or online (testing) phases. Our problem is motivated by real-world applications where observations are time-consuming and/or expensive. We develop a knowledge gradient policy using an online Bayesian linear classifier to guide the experiment by maximizing the expected value of information of labeling each alternative. We provide a finite-time analysis of the estimated error and show that the maximum likelihood estimator based produced by the KG policy is consistent and asymptotically normal. We also show that the knowledge gradient policy is asymptotically optimal in an offline setting. This work further extends the knowledge gradient to the setting of contextual bandits. We report the results of a series of experiments that demonstrate its efficiency."	Optimal Learning for Sequential Decision Making for Expensive Cost  Functions with Stochastic Binary Feedbacks
1203.1596v2	Positive definite operator-valued kernels generalize the well-known notion of reproducing kernels, and are naturally adapted to multi-output learning situations. This paper addresses the problem of learning a finite linear combination of infinite-dimensional operator-valued kernels which are suitable for extending functional data analysis methods to nonlinear contexts. We study this problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responses with an lr-norm constraint on the combination coefficients. The resulting optimization problem is more involved than those of multiple scalar-valued kernel learning since operator-valued kernels pose more technical and theoretical issues. We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learning algorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using a block coordinatedescent procedure. We experimentally validate our approach on a functional regression task in the context of finger movement prediction in brain-computer interfaces.	Multiple Operator-valued Kernel Learning
1604.03463v2	While the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian ($\mathcal{MGIG}$) distribution arises naturally in some settings as a distribution over symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, certain key properties of the distribution and effective ways of sampling from the distribution have not been carefully studied. In this paper, we show that the $\mathcal{MGIG}$ is unimodal, and the mode can be obtained by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) equation [7]. Based on the property, we propose an importance sampling method for the $\mathcal{MGIG}$ where the mode of the proposal distribution matches that of the target. The proposed sampling method is more efficient than existing approaches [32, 33], which use proposal distributions that may have the mode far from the $\mathcal{MGIG}$'s mode. Further, we illustrate that the the posterior distribution in latent factor models, such as probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [25], when marginalized over one latent factor has the $\mathcal{MGIG}$ distribution. The characterization leads to a novel Collapsed Monte Carlo (CMC) inference algorithm for such latent factor models. We illustrate that CMC has a lower log loss or perplexity than MCMC, and needs fewer samples.	The Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian Distribution: Properties and  Applications
1801.09055v1	Probability estimates are desirable in statistical classification both for gauging the accuracy of a classification result and for calibration. Here we describe a method of solving for the conditional probabilities in multi-class classification using orthogonal error correcting codes. The method is tested on six different datasets using support vector machines and compares favorably with an existing technique based on the one-versus-one multi-class method. Probabilities are validated based on the cumulative sum of a boolean evaluation of the correctness of the class label divided by the estimated probability. Probability estimation using orthogonal coding is simple and efficient and has the potential for faster classification results than the one-versus-one method.	Solving for multi-class using orthogonal coding matrices
1710.00569v1	We present a new method for forecasting systems of multiple interrelated time series. The method learns the forecast models together with discovering leading indicators from within the system that serve as good predictors improving the forecast accuracy and a cluster structure of the predictive tasks around these. The method is based on the classical linear vector autoregressive model (VAR) and links the discovery of the leading indicators to inferring sparse graphs of Granger causality. We formulate a new constrained optimisation problem to promote the desired sparse structures across the models and the sharing of information amongst the learning tasks in a multi-task manner. We propose an algorithm for solving the problem and document on a battery of synthetic and real-data experiments the advantages of our new method over baseline VAR models as well as the state-of-the-art sparse VAR learning methods.

1104.4803v4	"This paper considers the problem of clustering a partially observed unweighted graph---i.e., one where for some node pairs we know there is an edge between them, for some others we know there is no edge, and for the remaining we do not know whether or not there is an edge. We want to organize the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there is relatively dense (observed) connectivity within clusters, and sparse across clusters. We take a novel yet natural approach to this problem, by focusing on finding the clustering that minimizes the number of ""disagreements""---i.e., the sum of the number of (observed) missing edges within clusters, and (observed) present edges across clusters. Our algorithm uses convex optimization; its basis is a reduction of disagreement minimization to the problem of recovering an (unknown) low-rank matrix and an (unknown) sparse matrix from their partially observed sum. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the classical Planted Partition/Stochastic Block Model. Our main theorem provides sufficient conditions for the success of our algorithm as a function of the minimum cluster size, edge density and observation probability; in particular, the results characterize the tradeoff between the observation probability and the edge density gap. When there are a constant number of clusters of equal size, our results are optimal up to logarithmic factors."	Clustering Partially Observed Graphs via Convex Optimization
0901.3202v1	We consider the least-square linear regression problem with regularization by the $\ell^1$-norm, a problem usually referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we first present a detailed asymptotic analysis of model consistency of the Lasso in low-dimensional settings. For various decays of the regularization parameter, we compute asymptotic equivalents of the probability of correct model selection. For a specific rate decay, we show that the Lasso selects all the variables that should enter the model with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while it selects all other variables with strictly positive probability. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso for several bootstrapped replications of a given sample, then intersecting the supports of the Lasso bootstrap estimates leads to consistent model selection. This novel variable selection procedure, referred to as the Bolasso, is extended to high-dimensional settings by a provably consistent two-step procedure.

1511.03990v1	Supervised learning is an active research area, with numerous applications in diverse fields such as data analytics, computer vision, speech and audio processing, and image understanding. In most cases, the loss functions used in machine learning assume symmetric noise models, and seek to estimate the unknown function parameters. However, loss functions such as quantile and quantile Huber generalize the symmetric $\ell_1$ and Huber losses to the asymmetric setting, for a fixed quantile parameter. In this paper, we propose to jointly infer the quantile parameter and the unknown function parameters, for the asymmetric quantile Huber and quantile losses. We explore various properties of the quantile Huber loss and implement a convexity certificate that can be used to check convexity in the quantile parameter. When the loss if convex with respect to the parameter of the function, we prove that it is biconvex in both the function and the quantile parameters, and propose an algorithm to jointly estimate these. Results with synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically recover the quantile parameter corresponding to the noise and also provide an improved recovery of function parameters. To illustrate the potential of the framework, we extend the gradient boosting machines with quantile losses to automatically estimate the quantile parameter at each iteration.	Automatic Inference of the Quantile Parameter
0709.2989v1	Simulated annealing is a popular method for approaching the solution of a global optimization problem. Existing results on its performance apply to discrete combinatorial optimization where the optimization variables can assume only a finite set of possible values. We introduce a new general formulation of simulated annealing which allows one to guarantee finite-time performance in the optimization of functions of continuous variables. The results hold universally for any optimization problem on a bounded domain and establish a connection between simulated annealing and up-to-date theory of convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on continuous domains. This work is inspired by the concept of finite-time learning with known accuracy and confidence developed in statistical learning theory.	Simulated Annealing: Rigorous finite-time guarantees for optimization on  continuous domains
1510.08633v1	In this paper we study nonconvex penalization using Bernstein functions whose first-order derivatives are completely monotone. The Bernstein function can induce a class of nonconvex penalty functions for high-dimensional sparse estimation problems. We derive a thresholding function based on the Bernstein penalty and discuss some important mathematical properties in sparsity modeling. We show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for regression problems penalized by the Bernstein function. We also consider the application of the Bernstein penalty in classification problems and devise a proximal alternating linearized minimization method. Based on theory of the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality, we conduct convergence analysis of these alternating iteration procedures. We particularly exemplify a family of Bernstein nonconvex penalties based on a generalized Gamma measure and conduct empirical analysis for this family.

0811.1239v1	We consider the problem of jointly estimating the parameters as well as the structure of binary valued Markov Random Fields, in contrast to earlier work that focus on one of the two problems. We formulate the problem as a maximization of $\ell_1$-regularized surrogate likelihood that allows us to find a sparse solution. Our optimization technique efficiently incorporates the cutting-plane algorithm in order to obtain a tighter outer bound on the marginal polytope, which results in improvement of both parameter estimates and approximation to marginals. On synthetic data, we compare our algorithm on the two estimation tasks to the other existing methods. We analyze the method in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of dimensions $p$ is allowed to grow with the number of observations $n$. The rate of convergence of the estimate is demonstrated to depend explicitly on the sparsity of the underlying graph.	Improved Estimation of High-dimensional Ising Models
1602.03683v1	The mixture of experts (MoE) model is a popular neural network architecture for nonlinear regression and classification. The class of MoE mean functions is known to be uniformly convergent to any unknown target function, assuming that the target function is from Sobolev space that is sufficiently differentiable and that the domain of estimation is a compact unit hypercube. We provide an alternative result, which shows that the class of MoE mean functions is dense in the class of all continuous functions over arbitrary compact domains of estimation. Our result can be viewed as a universal approximation theorem for MoE models.	A Universal Approximation Theorem for Mixture of Experts Models
1705.09851v1	Deep learning applies hierarchical layers of hidden variables to construct nonlinear high dimensional predictors. Our goal is to develop and train deep learning architectures for spatio-temporal modeling. Training a deep architecture is achieved by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and drop-out (DO) for parameter regularization with a goal of minimizing out-of-sample predictive mean squared error. To illustrate our methodology, we predict the sharp discontinuities in traffic flow data, and secondly, we develop a classification rule to predict short-term futures market prices as a function of the order book depth. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.	Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Modeling: Dynamic Traffic Flows and  High Frequency Trading
1703.06528v1	The massive amount of available data potentially used to discover patters in machine learning is a challenge for kernel based algorithms with respect to runtime and storage capacities. Local approaches might help to relieve these issues. From a statistical point of view local approaches allow additionally to deal with different structures in the data in different ways. This paper analyses properties of localized kernel based, non-parametric statistical machine learning methods, in particular of support vector machines (SVMs) and methods close to them. We will show there that locally learnt kernel methods are universal consistent. Furthermore, we give an upper bound for the maxbias in order to show statistical robustness of the proposed method.

1206.1386v3	This paper considers the problem of robust subspace recovery: given a set of $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^D$, if many lie in a $d$-dimensional subspace, then can we recover the underlying subspace? We show that Tyler's M-estimator can be used to recover the underlying subspace, if the percentage of the inliers is larger than $d/D$ and the data points lie in general position. Empirically, Tyler's M-estimator compares favorably with other convex subspace recovery algorithms in both simulations and experiments on real data sets.

0902.1323v1	"In this paper we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for on-line variable selection in multivariate regression problems involving high dimensional data streams. The algorithm recursively extracts all the latent factors of a partial least squares solution and selects the most important variables for each factor. This is achieved by means of only one sparse singular value decomposition which can be efficiently updated on-line and in an adaptive fashion. Simulation results based on artificial data streams demonstrate that the algorithm is able to select important variables in dynamic settings where the correlation structure among the observed streams is governed by a few hidden components and the importance of each variable changes over time. We also report on an application of our algorithm to a multivariate version of the ""enhanced index tracking"" problem using financial data streams. The application consists of performing on-line asset allocation with the objective of overperforming two benchmark indices simultaneously."	Sparse partial least squares for on-line variable selection in  multivariate data streams
1205.2650v1	We are often interested in explaining data through a set of hidden factors or features. When the number of hidden features is unknown, the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is a nonparametric latent feature model that does not bound the number of active features in dataset. However, the IBP assumes that all latent features are uncorrelated, making it inadequate for many realworld problems. We introduce a framework for correlated nonparametric feature models, generalising the IBP. We use this framework to generate several specific models and demonstrate applications on realworld datasets.	Correlated Non-Parametric Latent Feature Models
1705.08814v1	We consider parametric exponential families of dimension $K$ on the real line. We study a variant of \textit{boundary crossing probabilities} coming from the multi-armed bandit literature, in the case when the real-valued distributions form an exponential family of dimension $K$. Formally, our result is a concentration inequality that bounds the probability that $\mathcal{B}^\psi(\hat \theta_n,\theta^\star)\geq f(t/n)/n$, where $\theta^\star$ is the parameter of an unknown target distribution, $\hat \theta_n$ is the empirical parameter estimate built from $n$ observations, $\psi$ is the log-partition function of the exponential family and $\mathcal{B}^\psi$ is the corresponding Bregman divergence. From the perspective of stochastic multi-armed bandits, we pay special attention to the case when the boundary function $f$ is logarithmic, as it is enables to analyze the regret of the state-of-the-art \KLUCB\ and \KLUCBp\ strategies, whose analysis was left open in such generality. Indeed, previous results only hold for the case when $K=1$, while we provide results for arbitrary finite dimension $K$, thus considerably extending the existing results. Perhaps surprisingly, we highlight that the proof techniques to achieve these strong results already existed three decades ago in the work of T.L. Lai, and were apparently forgotten in the bandit community. We provide a modern rewriting of these beautiful techniques that we believe are useful beyond the application to stochastic multi-armed bandits.

1608.05934v1	Exploration of hydrocarbon resources is a highly complicated and expensive process where various geological, geochemical and geophysical factors are developed then combined together. It is highly significant how to design the seismic data acquisition survey and locate the exploratory wells since incorrect or imprecise locations lead to waste of time and money during the operation. The objective of this study is to locate high-potential oil and gas field in 1: 250,000 sheet of Ahwaz including 20 oil fields to reduce both time and costs in exploration and production processes. In this regard, 17 maps were developed using GIS functions for factors including: minimum and maximum of total organic carbon (TOC), yield potential for hydrocarbons production (PP), Tmax peak, production index (PI), oxygen index (OI), hydrogen index (HI) as well as presence or proximity to high residual Bouguer gravity anomalies, proximity to anticline axis and faults, topography and curvature maps obtained from Asmari Formation subsurface contours. To model and to integrate maps, this study employed artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. The results obtained from model validation demonstrated that the 17x10x5 neural network with R=0.8948, RMS=0.0267, and kappa=0.9079 can be trained better than other models such as ANFIS and predicts the potential areas more accurately. However, this method failed to predict some oil fields and wrongly predict some areas as potential zones.	Spatial Modeling of Oil Exploration Areas Using Neural Networks and  ANFIS in GIS
1508.03666v1	Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a popular and efficient tool for global optimization and hyperparameter tuning. Currently, the established Bayesian optimization practice requires a user-defined bounding box which is assumed to contain the optimizer. However, when little is known about the probed objective function, it can be difficult to prescribe such bounds. In this work we modify the standard Bayesian optimization framework in a principled way to allow automatic resizing of the search space. We introduce two alternative methods and compare them on two common synthetic benchmarking test functions as well as the tasks of tuning the stochastic gradient descent optimizer of a multi-layered perceptron and a convolutional neural network on MNIST.	Unbounded Bayesian Optimization via Regularization
1204.2049v1	Support vector machines (SVMs) naturally embody sparseness due to their use of hinge loss functions. However, SVMs can not directly estimate conditional class probabilities. In this paper we propose and study a family of coherence functions, which are convex and differentiable, as surrogates of the hinge function. The coherence function is derived by using the maximum-entropy principle and is characterized by a temperature parameter. It bridges the hinge function and the logit function in logistic regression. The limit of the coherence function at zero temperature corresponds to the hinge function, and the limit of the minimizer of its expected error is the minimizer of the expected error of the hinge loss. We refer to the use of the coherence function in large-margin classification as C-learning, and we present efficient coordinate descent algorithms for the training of regularized ${\cal C}$-learning models.	Coherence Functions with Applications in Large-Margin Classification  Methods
1701.06607v2	Random sinusoidal features are a popular approach for speeding up kernel-based inference in large datasets. Prior to the inference stage, the approach suggests performing dimensionality reduction by first multiplying each data vector by a random Gaussian matrix, and then computing an element-wise sinusoid. Theoretical analysis shows that collecting a sufficient number of such features can be reliably used for subsequent inference in kernel classification and regression. In this work, we demonstrate that with a mild increase in the dimension of the embedding, it is also possible to reconstruct the data vector from such random sinusoidal features, provided that the underlying data is sparse enough. In particular, we propose a numerically stable algorithm for reconstructing the data vector given the nonlinear features, and analyze its sample complexity. Our algorithm can be extended to other types of structured inverse problems, such as demixing a pair of sparse (but incoherent) vectors. We support the efficacy of our approach via numerical experiments.	Stable Recovery Of Sparse Vectors From Random Sinusoidal Feature Maps
1703.06240v1	Bandit methods for black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation, are used in a variety of applications including hyper-parameter tuning and experiment design. Recently, \emph{multi-fidelity} methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. In many practical applications however, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space $(N,T)$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments.	Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimisation with Continuous Approximations
1601.00142v1	We introduce a general framework for estimation of inverse covariance, or precision, matrices from heterogeneous populations. The proposed framework uses a Laplacian shrinkage penalty to encourage similarity among estimates from disparate, but related, subpopulations, while allowing for differences among matrices. We propose an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for parameter estimation, as well as its extension for faster computation in high dimensions by thresholding the empirical covariance matrix to identify the joint block diagonal structure in the estimated precision matrices. We establish both variable selection and norm consistency of the proposed estimator for distributions with exponential or polynomial tails. Further, to extend the applicability of the method to the settings with unknown populations structure, we propose a Laplacian penalty based on hierarchical clustering, and discuss conditions under which this data-driven choice results in consistent estimation of precision matrices in heterogenous populations. Extensive numerical studies and applications to gene expression data from subtypes of cancer with distinct clinical outcomes indicate the potential advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches.	Joint Estimation of Precision Matrices in Heterogeneous Populations
1706.06878v3	In this paper, we present a method to determine the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) from the power measurements of one or more PV systems, located in the same neighborhood. The method is completely unsupervised and is based on a physical model of a PV plant. The precise assessment of solar irradiance is pivotal for the forecast of the electric power generated by photovoltaic (PV) plants. However, on-ground measurements are expensive and are generally not performed for small and medium-sized PV plants. Satellite-based services represent a valid alternative to on site measurements, but their space-time resolution is limited. Results from two case studies located in Switzerland are presented. The performance of the proposed method at assessing GHI is compared with that of free and commercial satellite services. Our results show that the presented method is generally better than satellite-based services, especially at high temporal resolutions.

0911.5460v5	High-dimensional data pose challenges in statistical learning and modeling. Sometimes the predictors can be naturally grouped where pursuing the between-group sparsity is desired. Collinearity may occur in real-world high-dimensional applications where the popular $l_1$ technique suffers from both selection inconsistency and prediction inaccuracy. Moreover, the problems of interest often go beyond Gaussian models. To meet these challenges, nonconvex penalized generalized linear models with grouped predictors are investigated and a simple-to-implement algorithm is proposed for computation. A rigorous theoretical result guarantees its convergence and provides tight preliminary scaling. This framework allows for grouped predictors and nonconvex penalties, including the discrete $l_0$ and the `$l_0+l_2$' type penalties. Penalty design and parameter tuning for nonconvex penalties are examined. Applications of super-resolution spectrum estimation in signal processing and cancer classification with joint gene selection in bioinformatics show the performance improvement by nonconvex penalized estimation.

1312.0712v3	Non-orthogonal joint diagonalization (NJD) free of prewhitening has been widely studied in the context of blind source separation (BSS) and array signal processing, etc. However, NJD is used to retrieve the jointly diagonalizable structure for a single set of target matrices which are mostly formulized with a single dataset, and thus is insufficient to handle multiple datasets with inter-set dependences, a scenario often encountered in joint BSS (J-BSS) applications. As such, we present a generalized NJD (GNJD) algorithm to simultaneously perform asymmetric NJD upon multiple sets of target matrices with mutually linked loading matrices, by using LU decomposition and successive rotations, to enable J-BSS over multiple datasets with indication/exploitation of their mutual dependences. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

1604.04741v1	"Time-varying mixture densities occur in many scenarios, for example, the distributions of keywords that appear in publications may evolve from year to year, video frame features associated with multiple targets may evolve in a sequence. Any models that realistically cater to this phenomenon must exhibit two important properties: the underlying mixture densities must have an unknown number of mixtures, and there must be some ""smoothness"" constraints in place for the adjacent mixture densities. The traditional Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) may be suited to the first property, but certainly not the second. This is due to how each random measure in the lower hierarchies is sampled independent of each other and hence does not facilitate any temporal correlations. To overcome such shortcomings, we proposed a new Smoothed Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (sHDP). The key novelty of this model is that we place a temporal constraint amongst the nearby discrete measures $\{G_j\}$ in the form of symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence with a fixed bound $B$. Although the constraint we place only involves a single scalar value, it nonetheless allows for flexibility in the corresponding successive measures. Remarkably, it also led us to infer the model within the stick-breaking process where the traditional Beta distribution used in stick-breaking is now replaced by a new constraint calculated from $B$. We present the inference algorithm and elaborate on its solutions. Our experiment using NIPS keywords has shown the desirable effect of the model."

1605.06197v3	We extend Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to perform posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes. This development allows us to define a Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE), a Bayesian nonparametric version of the variational autoencoder that has a latent representation with stochastic dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the SB-VAE, and a semi-supervised variant, learn highly discriminative latent representations that often outperform the Gaussian VAE's.

1401.7145v1	In this paper we demonstrate that tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for Bayesian models by recursively subsampling observations without replacement can improve the performance of baseline samplers in terms of effective sample size per computation. We present two tempering by subsampling algorithms, subsampled parallel tempering and subsampled tempered transitions. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the computational cost of tempering by subsampling, verify that tempering by subsampling costs less than traditional tempering, and demonstrate both algorithms on Bayesian approaches to learning the mean of a high dimensional multivariate Normal and estimating Gaussian process hyperparameters.	Tempering by Subsampling
1611.00261v1	We propose a new method of discovering causal relationships in temporal data based on the notion of causal compression. To this end, we adopt the Pearlian graph setting and the directed information as an information theoretic tool for quantifying causality. We introduce chain rule for directed information and use it to motivate causal sparsity. We show two applications of the proposed method: causal time series segmentation which selects time points capturing the incoming and outgoing causal flow between time points belonging to different signals, and causal bipartite graph recovery. We prove that modelling of causality in the adopted set-up only requires estimating the copula density of the data distribution and thus does not depend on its marginals. We evaluate the method on time resolved gene expression data.	Causal Compression
1710.05989v1	In machine learning and data mining, linear models have been widely used to model the response as parametric linear functions of the predictors. To relax such stringent assumptions made by parametric linear models, additive models consider the response to be a summation of unknown transformations applied on the predictors; in particular, additive isotonic models (AIMs) assume the unknown transformations to be monotone. In this paper, we introduce sparse linear isotonic models (SLIMs) for highdimensional problems by hybridizing ideas in parametric sparse linear models and AIMs, which enjoy a few appealing advantages over both. In the high-dimensional setting, a two-step algorithm is proposed for estimating the sparse parameters as well as the monotone functions over predictors. Under mild statistical assumptions, we show that the algorithm can accurately estimate the parameters. Promising preliminary experiments are presented to support the theoretical results.

1106.1216v2	In many recent applications, data is plentiful. By now, we have a rather clear understanding of how more data can be used to improve the accuracy of learning algorithms. Recently, there has been a growing interest in understanding how more data can be leveraged to reduce the required training runtime. In this paper, we study the runtime of learning as a function of the number of available training examples, and underscore the main high-level techniques. We provide some initial positive results showing that the runtime can decrease exponentially while only requiring a polynomial growth of the number of examples, and spell-out several interesting open problems.	Using More Data to Speed-up Training Time
1711.04674v1	Model criticism is usually carried out by assessing if replicated data generated under the fitted model looks similar to the observed data, see e.g. Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin (2004, p. 165). This paper presents a method for latent variable models by pulling back the data into the space of latent variables, and carrying out model criticism in that space. Making use of a model's structure enables a more direct assessment of the assumptions made in the prior and likelihood. We demonstrate the method with examples of model criticism in latent space applied to ANOVA, factor analysis, linear dynamical systems and Gaussian processes.	Model Criticism in Latent Space
1507.06615v1	One of the limiting factors of using support vector machines (SVMs) in large scale applications are their super-linear computational requirements in terms of the number of training samples. To address this issue, several approaches that train SVMs on many small chunks of large data sets separately have been proposed in the literature. So far, however, almost all these approaches have only been empirically investigated. In addition, their motivation was always based on computational requirements. In this work, we consider a localized SVM approach based upon a partition of the input space. For this local SVM, we derive a general oracle inequality. Then we apply this oracle inequality to least squares regression using Gaussian kernels and deduce local learning rates that are essentially minimax optimal under some standard smoothness assumptions on the regression function. This gives the first motivation for using local SVMs that is not based on computational requirements but on theoretical predictions on the generalization performance. We further introduce a data-dependent parameter selection method for our local SVM approach and show that this method achieves the same learning rates as before. Finally, we present some larger scale experiments for our localized SVM showing that it achieves essentially the same test performance as a global SVM for a fraction of the computational requirements. In addition, it turns out that the computational requirements for the local SVMs are similar to those of a vanilla random chunk approach, while the achieved test errors are significantly better.	Optimal Learning Rates for Localized SVMs
1707.05342v2	We study learning problems in the general setup, for arbitrary classes of functions $F$, distributions $X$ and targets $Y$. Because proper learning procedures, i.e., procedures that are only allowed to select functions in $F$, tend to perform poorly unless the problem satisfies some additional structural property (e.g., that $F$ is convex), we consider unrestricted learning procedures, that is, procedures that are free to choose functions outside the given class $F$. We present a new unrestricted procedure that is optimal in a very strong sense: it attains the best possible accuracy/confidence tradeoff for (almost) any triplet $(F,X,Y)$, including in heavy-tailed problems. Moreover, the tradeoff the procedure attains coincides with what one would expect if $F$ were convex, even when $F$ is not; and when $F$ happens to be convex, the procedure is proper; thus, the unrestricted procedure is actually optimal in both realms, for convex classes as a proper procedure and for arbitrary classes as an unrestricted procedure. The notion of optimality we consider is problem specific: our procedure performs with the best accuracy/confidence tradeoff one can hope to achieve for each individual problem. As such, it is a significantly stronger property than the standard `worst-case' notion, in which one considers optimality as the best uniform estimate that holds for a relatively large family of problems. Thanks to the sharp and problem-specific estimates we obtain, classical, worst-case bounds are immediate outcomes of our main result.	An optimal unrestricted learning procedure
1605.00355v1	Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are probabilistic tools of choice for analyzing conditional dependencies between variables in complex systems. Finding changepoints in the structural evolution of a GGM is therefore essential to detecting anomalies in the underlying system modeled by the GGM. In order to detect structural anomalies in a GGM, we consider the problem of estimating changes in the precision matrix of the corresponding Gaussian distribution. We take a two-step approach to solving this problem:- (i) estimating a background precision matrix using system observations from the past without any anomalies, and (ii) estimating a foreground precision matrix using a sliding temporal window during anomaly monitoring. Our primary contribution is in estimating the foreground precision using a novel contrastive inverse covariance estimation procedure. In order to accurately learn only the structural changes to the GGM, we maximize a penalized log-likelihood where the penalty is the $l_1$ norm of difference between the foreground precision being estimated and the already learned background precision. We modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for sparse inverse covariance estimation to perform contrastive estimation of the foreground precision matrix. Our results on simulated GGM data show significant improvement in precision and recall for detecting structural changes to the GGM, compared to a non-contrastive sliding window baseline.	Contrastive Structured Anomaly Detection for Gaussian Graphical Models
1610.02287v3	The reparameterization gradient has become a widely used method to obtain Monte Carlo gradients to optimize the variational objective. However, this technique does not easily apply to commonly used distributions such as beta or gamma without further approximations, and most practical applications of the reparameterization gradient fit Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we introduce the generalized reparameterization gradient, a method that extends the reparameterization gradient to a wider class of variational distributions. Generalized reparameterizations use invertible transformations of the latent variables which lead to transformed distributions that weakly depend on the variational parameters. This results in new Monte Carlo gradients that combine reparameterization gradients and score function gradients. We demonstrate our approach on variational inference for two complex probabilistic models. The generalized reparameterization is effective: even a single sample from the variational distribution is enough to obtain a low-variance gradient.	The Generalized Reparameterization Gradient
1407.6949v1	This paper presents a Bayesian generative model for dependent Cox point processes, alongside an efficient inference scheme which scales as if the point processes were modelled independently. We can handle missing data naturally, infer latent structure, and cope with large numbers of observed processes. A further novel contribution enables the model to work effectively in higher dimensional spaces. Using this method, we achieve vastly improved predictive performance on both 2D and 1D real data, validating our structured approach.

1203.4723v1	We propose a solution to the image deconvolution problem where the convolution kernel or point spread function (PSF) is assumed to be only partially known. Small perturbations generated from the model are exploited to produce a few principal components explaining the PSF uncertainty in a high dimensional space. Unlike recent developments on blind deconvolution of natural images, we assume the image is sparse in the pixel basis, a natural sparsity arising in magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). Our approach adopts a Bayesian Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework. The performance of our Bayesian semi-blind algorithm for sparse images is superior to previously proposed semi-blind algorithms such as the alternating minimization (AM) algorithm and blind algorithms developed for natural images. We illustrate our myopic algorithm on real MRFM tobacco virus data.	Semi-blind Sparse Image Reconstruction with Application to MRFM
1008.3951v3	"We propose a simple kernel based nearest neighbor approach for handwritten digit classification. The ""distance"" here is actually a kernel defining the similarity between two images. We carefully study the effects of different number of neighbors and weight schemes and report the results. With only a few nearest neighbors (or most similar images) to vote, the test set error rate on MNIST database could reach about 1.5%-2.0%, which is very close to many advanced models."

1509.03381v1	Using a proper model to characterize a time series is crucial in making accurate predictions. In this work we use time-varying autoregressive process (TVAR) to describe non-stationary time series and model it as a mixture of multiple stable autoregressive (AR) processes. We introduce a new model selection technique based on Gap statistics to learn the appropriate number of AR filters needed to model a time series. We define a new distance measure between stable AR filters and draw a reference curve that is used to measure how much adding a new AR filter improves the performance of the model, and then choose the number of AR filters that has the maximum gap with the reference curve. To that end, we propose a new method in order to generate uniform random stable AR filters in root domain. Numerical results are provided demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach.	Learning the Number of Autoregressive Mixtures in Time Series Using the  Gap Statistics
1707.03530v1	We propose a method for estimating coefficients in multivariate regression when there is a clustering structure to the response variables. The proposed method includes a fusion penalty, to shrink the difference in fitted values from responses in the same cluster, and an L1 penalty for simultaneous variable selection and estimation. The method can be used when the grouping structure of the response variables is known or unknown. When the clustering structure is unknown the method will simultaneously estimate the clusters of the response and the regression coefficients. Theoretical results are presented for the penalized least squares case, including asymptotic results allowing for p >> n. We extend our method to the setting where the responses are binomial variables. We propose a coordinate descent algorithm for both the normal and binomial likelihood, which can easily be extended to other generalized linear model (GLM) settings. Simulations and data examples from business operations and genomics are presented to show the merits of both the least squares and binomial methods.	A Cluster Fusion Penalty for Grouping Response Variables in Multivariate  Regression Models
0906.3590v1	Variable selection for high-dimensional linear models has received a lot of attention lately, mostly in the context of l1-regularization. Part of the attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained, which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power, however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand, lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize. A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily to visualization and interpretation. The predictive power is maintained at least at the same level as the original tree ensemble. A key feature of the method is that, once a tree ensemble is fitted, no further tuning parameter needs to be selected. The empirical performance is demonstrated on a wide array of datasets.

1605.01779v1	With the recent popularity of graphical clustering methods, there has been an increased focus on the information between samples. We show how learning cluster structure using edge features naturally and simultaneously determines the most likely number of clusters and addresses data scale issues. These results are particularly useful in instances where (a) there are a large number of clusters and (b) we have some labeled edges. Applications in this domain include image segmentation, community discovery and entity resolution. Our model is an extension of the planted partition model and our solution uses results of correlation clustering, which achieves a partition O(log(n))-close to the log-likelihood of the true clustering.	Clustering on the Edge: Learning Structure in Graphs
1704.07353v2	"We consider the problem of estimating a consensus community structure by combining information from multiple layers of a multi-layer network or multiple snapshots of a time-varying network. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature for the more general problem of multi-view clustering in the past decade based on the spectral clustering or a low-rank matrix factorization. As a general theme, these ""intermediate fusion"" methods involve obtaining a low column rank matrix by optimizing an objective function and then using the columns of the matrix for clustering. However, the theoretical properties of these methods remain largely unexplored and most researchers have relied on the performance in synthetic and real data to assess the goodness of the procedures. In the absence of statistical guarantees on the objective functions, it is difficult to determine if the algorithms optimizing the objective will return a good community structure. We apply some of these methods for consensus community detection in multi-layer networks and investigate the consistency properties of the global optimizer of the objective functions under the multi-layer stochastic blockmodel. We derive several new asymptotic results showing consistency of the intermediate fusion techniques along with the spectral clustering of mean adjacency matrix under a high dimensional setup, where the number of nodes, the number of layers and the number of communities of the multi-layer graph grow. Our numerical study shows that in comparison to the intermediate fusion techniques, late fusion methods, namely spectral clustering on aggregate spectral kernel and module allegiance matrix, under-perform in sparse networks, while the spectral clustering of mean adjacency matrix under-performs in multi-layer networks that contain layers with both homophilic and heterophilic clusters."

1203.4422v1	We address the problems of multi-domain and single-domain regression based on distinct and unpaired labeled training sets for each of the domains and a large unlabeled training set from all domains. We formulate these problems as a Bayesian estimation with partial knowledge of statistical relations. We propose a worst-case design strategy and study the resulting estimators. Our analysis explicitly accounts for the cardinality of the labeled sets and includes the special cases in which one of the labeled sets is very large or, in the other extreme, completely missing. We demonstrate our estimators in the context of removing expressions from facial images and in the context of audio-visual word recognition, and provide comparisons to several recently proposed multi-modal learning algorithms.	Semi-Supervised Single- and Multi-Domain Regression with Multi-Domain  Training
1406.1922v2	This paper deals with the problem of nonparametric independence testing, a fundamental decision-theoretic problem that asks if two arbitrary (possibly multivariate) random variables $X,Y$ are independent or not, a question that comes up in many fields like causality and neuroscience. While quantities like correlation of $X,Y$ only test for (univariate) linear independence, natural alternatives like mutual information of $X,Y$ are hard to estimate due to a serious curse of dimensionality. A recent approach, avoiding both issues, estimates norms of an \textit{operator} in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). Our main contribution is strong empirical evidence that by employing \textit{shrunk} operators when the sample size is small, one can attain an improvement in power at low false positive rates. We analyze the effects of Stein shrinkage on a popular test statistic called HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion). Our observations provide insights into two recently proposed shrinkage estimators, SCOSE and FCOSE - we prove that SCOSE is (essentially) the optimal linear shrinkage method for \textit{estimating} the true operator; however, the non-linearly shrunk FCOSE usually achieves greater improvements in \textit{test power}. This work is important for more powerful nonparametric detection of subtle nonlinear dependencies for small samples.	Nonparametric Independence Testing for Small Sample Sizes
1003.2245v1	We study the problem of allocating stocks to dark pools. We propose and analyze an optimal approach for allocations, if continuous-valued allocations are allowed. We also propose a modification for the case when only integer-valued allocations are possible. We extend the previous work on this problem to adversarial scenarios, while also improving on their results in the iid setup. The resulting algorithms are efficient, and perform well in simulations under stochastic and adversarial inputs.	Optimal Allocation Strategies for the Dark Pool Problem
1708.02183v3	Gaussian process regression generally does not scale to beyond a few thousands data points without applying some sort of kernel approximation method. Most approximations focus on the high eigenvalue part of the spectrum of the kernel matrix, $K$, which leads to bad performance when the length scale of the kernel is small. In this paper we introduce Multiresolution Kernel Approximation (MKA), the first true broad bandwidth kernel approximation algorithm. Important points about MKA are that it is memory efficient, and it is a direct method, which means that it also makes it easy to approximate $K^{-1}$ and $\mathop{\textrm{det}}(K)$.

0807.3719v2	This paper focuses on obtaining clustering information about a distribution from its i.i.d. samples. We develop theoretical results to understand and use clustering information contained in the eigenvectors of data adjacency matrices based on a radial kernel function with a sufficiently fast tail decay. In particular, we provide population analyses to gain insights into which eigenvectors should be used and when the clustering information for the distribution can be recovered from the sample. We learn that a fixed number of top eigenvectors might at the same time contain redundant clustering information and miss relevant clustering information. We use this insight to design the data spectroscopic clustering (DaSpec) algorithm that utilizes properly selected eigenvectors to determine the number of clusters automatically and to group the data accordingly. Our findings extend the intuitions underlying existing spectral techniques such as spectral clustering and Kernel Principal Components Analysis, and provide new understanding into their usability and modes of failure. Simulation studies and experiments on real-world data are conducted to show the potential of our algorithm. In particular, DaSpec is found to handle unbalanced groups and recover clusters of different shapes better than the competing methods.

1104.4385v1	Statistical dependencies among wavelet coefficients are commonly represented by graphical models such as hidden Markov trees(HMTs). However, in linear inverse problems such as deconvolution, tomography, and compressed sensing, the presence of a sensing or observation matrix produces a linear mixing of the simple Markovian dependency structure. This leads to reconstruction problems that are non-convex optimizations. Past work has dealt with this issue by resorting to greedy or suboptimal iterative reconstruction methods. In this paper, we propose new modeling approaches based on group-sparsity penalties that leads to convex optimizations that can be solved exactly and efficiently. We show that the methods we develop perform significantly better in deconvolution and compressed sensing applications, while being as computationally efficient as standard coefficient-wise approaches such as lasso.	Convex Approaches to Model Wavelet Sparsity Patterns
1203.2177v1	This paper analyses the problem of Gaussian process (GP) bandits with deterministic observations. The analysis uses a branch and bound algorithm that is related to the UCB algorithm of (Srinivas et al., 2010). For GPs with Gaussian observation noise, with variance strictly greater than zero, (Srinivas et al., 2010) proved that the regret vanishes at the approximate rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}})$, where t is the number of observations. To complement their result, we attack the deterministic case and attain a much faster exponential convergence rate. Under some regularity assumptions, we show that the regret decreases asymptotically according to $O(e^{-\frac{\tau t}{(\ln t)^{d/4}}})$ with high probability. Here, d is the dimension of the search space and $\tau$ is a constant that depends on the behaviour of the objective function near its global maximum.	Regret Bounds for Deterministic Gaussian Process Bandits
1105.0382v1	We present a method to stop the evaluation of a decision making process when the result of the full evaluation is obvious. This trait is highly desirable for online margin-based machine learning algorithms where a classifier traditionally evaluates all the features for every example. We observe that some examples are easier to classify than others, a phenomenon which is characterized by the event when most of the features agree on the class of an example. By stopping the feature evaluation when encountering an easy to classify example, the learning algorithm can achieve substantial gains in computation. Our method provides a natural attention mechanism for learning algorithms. By modifying Pegasos, a margin-based online learning algorithm, to include our attentive method we lower the number of attributes computed from $n$ to an average of $O(\sqrt{n})$ features without loss in prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Attentive Pegasos on MNIST data.	Rapid Learning with Stochastic Focus of Attention
1202.3716v1	In this paper, we derive a novel probabilistic model of boosting as a Product of Experts. We re-derive the boosting algorithm as a greedy incremental model selection procedure which ensures that addition of new experts to the ensemble does not decrease the likelihood of the data. These learning rules lead to a generic boosting algorithm - POE- Boost which turns out to be similar to the AdaBoost algorithm under certain assumptions on the expert probabilities. The paper then extends the POEBoost algorithm to POEBoost.CS which handles hypothesis that produce probabilistic predictions. This new algorithm is shown to have better generalization performance compared to other state of the art algorithms.	Boosting as a Product of Experts
1709.00843v1	The small-ball method was introduced as a way of obtaining a high probability, isomorphic lower bound on the quadratic empirical process, under weak assumptions on the indexing class. The key assumption was that class members satisfy a uniform small-ball estimate, that is, $Pr(|f| \geq \kappa\|f\|_{L_2}) \geq \delta$ for given constants $\kappa$ and $\delta$. Here we extend the small-ball method and obtain a high probability, almost-isometric (rather than isomorphic) lower bound on the quadratic empirical process. The scope of the result is considerably wider than the small-ball method: there is no need for class members to satisfy a uniform small-ball condition, and moreover, motivated by the notion of tournament learning procedures, the result is stable under a `majority vote'. As applications, we study the performance of empirical risk minimization in learning problems involving bounded subsets of $L_p$ that satisfy a Bernstein condition, and of the tournament procedure in problems involving bounded subsets of $L_\infty$.	Extending the small-ball method
1602.04601v2	Discovering statistically significant patterns from databases is an important challenging problem. The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of taking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact that patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in databases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern mining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is built on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called selective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as statistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions conditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a tractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection bias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to characterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main contribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of predictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic framework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically significant patterns from databases.	Selective Inference Approach for Statistically Sound Predictive Pattern  Mining
1510.05492v2	In this paper the exact linear relation between the leading eigenvectors of the modularity matrix and the singular vectors of an uncentered data matrix is developed. Based on this analysis the concept of a modularity component is defined, and its properties are developed. It is shown that modularity component analysis can be used to cluster data similar to how traditional principal component analysis is used except that modularity component analysis does not require data centering.

1202.3753v1	We present a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating posterior probabilities of structural features in Bayesian networks. The method draws samples from the posterior distribution of partial orders on the nodes; for each sampled partial order, the conditional probabilities of interest are computed exactly. We give both analytical and empirical results that suggest the superiority of the new method compared to previous methods, which sample either directed acyclic graphs or linear orders on the nodes.

1111.6160v1	We consider a standard binary classification problem. The performance of any binary classifier based on the training data is characterized by the excess risk. We study Bahadur's type exponential bounds on the minimax accuracy confidence function based on the excess risk. We study how this quantity depends on the complexity of the class of distributions characterized by exponents of entropies of the class of regression functions or of the class of Bayes classifiers corresponding to the distributions from the class. We also study its dependence on margin parameters of the classification problem.	Optimal exponential bounds on the accuracy of classification
1705.10378v4	"In this paper, we consider the problem of fair statistical inference involving outcome variables. Examples include classification and regression problems, and estimating treatment effects in randomized trials or observational data. The issue of fairness arises in such problems where some covariates or treatments are ""sensitive,"" in the sense of having potential of creating discrimination. In this paper, we argue that the presence of discrimination can be formalized in a sensible way as the presence of an effect of a sensitive covariate on the outcome along certain causal pathways, a view which generalizes (Pearl, 2009). A fair outcome model can then be learned by solving a constrained optimization problem. We discuss a number of complications that arise in classical statistical inference due to this view and provide workarounds based on recent work in causal and semi-parametric inference."

1703.08972v1	We consider the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in linear quadratic (LQ) control problems, where the state dynamics is linear and the cost function is quadratic in states and controls. We analyze the regret of Thompson sampling (TS) (a.k.a. posterior-sampling for reinforcement learning) in the frequentist setting, i.e., when the parameters characterizing the LQ dynamics are fixed. Despite the empirical and theoretical success in a wide range of problems from multi-armed bandit to linear bandit, we show that when studying the frequentist regret TS in control problems, we need to trade-off the frequency of sampling optimistic parameters and the frequency of switches in the control policy. This results in an overall regret of $O(T^{2/3})$, which is significantly worse than the regret $O(\sqrt{T})$ achieved by the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty algorithm in LQ control problems.	Thompson Sampling for Linear-Quadratic Control Problems
1602.05563v1	To the best of our knowledge, there are no general well-founded robust methods for statistical unsupervised learning. Most of the unsupervised methods explicitly or implicitly depend on the kernel covariance operator (kernel CO) or kernel cross-covariance operator (kernel CCO). They are sensitive to contaminated data, even when using bounded positive definite kernels. First, we propose robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and robust kernel crosscovariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss function instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we propose influence function of classical kernel canonical correlation analysis (classical kernel CCA). Third, using this influence function, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations from two sets of data. Finally, we propose a method based on robust kernel CO and robust kernel CCO, called robust kernel CCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than classical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel methods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO. Experiments on synthesized and imaging genetics analysis demonstrate that the proposed visualization and robust kernel CCA can be applied effectively to both ideal data and contaminated data. The robust methods show the superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.	Robust Kernel (Cross-) Covariance Operators in Reproducing Kernel  Hilbert Space toward Kernel Methods
1703.08937v1	Existing strategies for finite-armed stochastic bandits mostly depend on a parameter of scale that must be known in advance. Sometimes this is in the form of a bound on the payoffs, or the knowledge of a variance or subgaussian parameter. The notable exceptions are the analysis of Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance by Cowan and Katehakis [2015] and of uniform distributions with unknown support [Cowan and Katehakis, 2015]. The results derived in these specialised cases are generalised here to the non-parametric setup, where the learner knows only a bound on the kurtosis of the noise, which is a scale free measure of the extremity of outliers.

1310.6067v1	Combining information from different sources is a common way to improve classification accuracy in Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI). For instance, in small sample settings it is useful to integrate data from other subjects or sessions in order to improve the estimation quality of the spatial filters or the classifier. Since data from different subjects may show large variability, it is crucial to weight the contributions according to importance. Many multi-subject learning algorithms determine the optimal weighting in a separate step by using heuristics, however, without ensuring that the selected weights are optimal with respect to classification. In this work we apply Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to this problem. MKL has been widely used for feature fusion in computer vision and allows to simultaneously learn the classifier and the optimal weighting. We compare the MKL method to two baseline approaches and investigate the reasons for performance improvement.	Multiple Kernel Learning for Brain-Computer Interfacing
1802.03759v1	There are a multitude of methods to perform multi-set correlated component analysis (MCCA), including some that require iterative solutions. The methods differ on the criterion they optimize and the constraints placed on the solutions. This note focuses perhaps on the simplest version, which can be solved in a single step as the eigenvectors of matrix ${\bf D}^{-1} {\bf R}$. Here ${\bf R}$ is the covariance matrix of the concatenated data, and ${\bf D}$ is its block-diagonal. This note shows that this solution maximizes inter-set correlation (ISC) without further constraints. It also relates the solution to a two step procedure, which first whitens each dataset using PCA, and then performs an additional PCA on the concatenated and whitened data. Both these solutions are known, although a clear derivation and simple implementation are hard to find. This short note aims to remedy this.	Multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis simply explained
1702.08320v2	The pseudo-likelihood method is one of the most popular algorithms for learning sparse binary pairwise Markov networks. In this paper, we formulate the $L_1$ regularized pseudo-likelihood problem as a sparse multiple logistic regression problem. In this way, many insights and optimization procedures for sparse logistic regression can be applied to the learning of discrete Markov networks. Specifically, we use the coordinate descent algorithm for generalized linear models with convex penalties, combined with strong screening rules, to solve the pseudo-likelihood problem with $L_1$ regularization. Therefore a substantial speedup without losing any accuracy can be achieved. Furthermore, this method is more stable than the node-wise logistic regression approach on unbalanced high-dimensional data when penalized by small regularization parameters. Thorough numerical experiments on simulated data and real world data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.

1711.03431v1	One iteration of $k$-means or EM for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) scales linearly with the number of data points $N$, the number of clusters $C$, and the data dimensionality $D$. In this study, we explore whether one iteration of $k$-means or EM for GMMs can scale sublinearly with $C$ at run-time, while the increase of the clustering objective remains effective. The tool we apply for complexity reduction is variational EM, which is typically applied to make training of generative models with exponentially many hidden states tractable. Here, we apply novel theoretical results on truncated variational EM to make tractable clustering algorithms more efficient. The basic idea is the use of a partial variational E-step which reduces the linear complexity of $\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ required for a full E-step to a sublinear complexity. Our main observation is that the linear dependency on $C$ can be reduced to a dependency on a much smaller parameter $G$, related to the cluster neighborhood relationship. We focus on two versions of partial variational EM for clustering: variational GMM, scaling with $\mathcal{O}(NG^2D)$, and variational $k$-means, scaling with $\mathcal{O}(NGD)$ per iteration. Empirical results then show that these algorithms still require comparable numbers of iterations to increase the clustering objective to the same values as $k$-means. For data with many clusters, we consequently observe reductions of the net computational demands between two and three orders of magnitude. More generally, our results provide substantial empirical evidence in favor of clustering to scale sublinearly with $C$.	Can clustering scale sublinearly with its clusters?

1205.5819v2	It was proved in 1998 by Ben-David and Litman that a concept space has a sample compression scheme of size d if and only if every finite subspace has a sample compression scheme of size d. In the compactness theorem, measurability of the hypotheses of the created sample compression scheme is not guaranteed; at the same time measurability of the hypotheses is a necessary condition for learnability. In this thesis we discuss when a sample compression scheme, created from com- pression schemes on finite subspaces via the compactness theorem, have measurable hypotheses. We show that if X is a standard Borel space with a d-maximum and universally separable concept class C, then (X,C) has a sample compression scheme of size d with universally Borel measurable hypotheses. Additionally we introduce a new variant of compression scheme called a copy sample compression scheme.	Measurability Aspects of the Compactness Theorem for Sample Compression  Schemes
1411.0707v1	We use statistical learning methods to construct an adaptive state estimator for nonlinear stochastic systems. Optimal state estimation, in the form of a Kalman filter, requires knowledge of the system's process and measurement uncertainty. We propose that these uncertainties can be estimated from (conditioned on) past observed data, and without making any assumptions of the system's prior distribution. The system's prior distribution at each time step is constructed from an ensemble of least-squares estimates on sub-sampled sets of the data via jackknife sampling. As new data is acquired, the state estimates, process uncertainty, and measurement uncertainty are updated accordingly, as described in this manuscript.

1204.2069v4	Hierarchical statistical models are widely employed in information science and data engineering. The models consist of two types of variables: observable variables that represent the given data and latent variables for the unobservable labels. An asymptotic analysis of the models plays an important role in evaluating the learning process; the result of the analysis is applied not only to theoretical but also to practical situations, such as optimal model selection and active learning. There are many studies of generalization errors, which measure the prediction accuracy of the observable variables. However, the accuracy of estimating the latent variables has not yet been elucidated. For a quantitative evaluation of this, the present paper formulates distribution-based functions for the errors in the estimation of the latent variables. The asymptotic behavior is analyzed for both the maximum likelihood and the Bayes methods.	Asymptotic Accuracy of Distribution-Based Estimation for Latent  Variables
1203.1065v1	In several application domains, high-dimensional observations are collected and then analysed in search for naturally occurring data clusters which might provide further insights about the nature of the problem. In this paper we describe a new approach for partitioning such high-dimensional data. Our assumption is that, within each cluster, the data can be approximated well by a linear subspace estimated by means of a principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed algorithm, Predictive Subspace Clustering (PSC) partitions the data into clusters while simultaneously estimating cluster-wise PCA parameters. The algorithm minimises an objective function that depends upon a new measure of influence for PCA models. A penalised version of the algorithm is also described for carrying our simultaneous subspace clustering and variable selection. The convergence of PSC is discussed in detail, and extensive simulation results and comparisons to competing methods are presented. The comparative performance of PSC has been assessed on six real gene expression data sets for which PSC often provides state-of-art results.

1106.3571v2	Given a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H of real-valued functions and a suitable measure mu over the source space D (subset of R), we decompose H as the sum of a subspace of centered functions for mu and its orthogonal in H. This decomposition leads to a special case of ANOVA kernels, for which the functional ANOVA representation of the best predictor can be elegantly derived, either in an interpolation or regularization framework. The proposed kernels appear to be particularly convenient for analyzing the e ffect of each (group of) variable(s) and computing sensitivity indices without recursivity.

1112.4321v1	In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for exploratory projection pursuit. The basis of the algorithm is the insight that previous approaches used fairly narrow definitions of interestingness / non interestingness. We argue that allowing these definitions to depend on the problem / data at hand is a more natural approach in an exploratory technique. This also allows our technique much greater applicability than the approaches extant in the literature. Complementing this insight, we propose a class of projection indices based on the spatial distribution function that can make use of such information. Finally, with the help of real datasets, we demonstrate how a range of multivariate exploratory tasks can be addressed with our algorithm. The examples further demonstrate that the proposed indices are quite capable of focussing on the interesting structure in the data, even when this structure is otherwise hard to detect or arises from very subtle patterns.	A New Algorithm for Exploratory Projection Pursuit
1610.08637v1	The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm has been widely used in statistical estimation for large-scale data due to its computational and memory efficiency. While most existing work focuses on the convergence of the objective function or the error of the obtained solution, we investigate the problem of statistical inference of the true model parameters based on SGD. To this end, we propose two consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariance of the average iterate from SGD: (1) an intuitive plug-in estimator and (2) a computationally more efficient batch-means estimator, which only uses the iterates from SGD. As the SGD process forms a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, our batch-means estimator with carefully chosen increasing batch sizes generalizes the classical batch-means estimator designed for time-homogenous Markov chains. The proposed batch-means estimator is of independent interest, which can be potentially used for estimating the covariance of other time-inhomogeneous Markov chains. Both proposed estimators allow us to construct asymptotically exact confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. We further discuss an extension to conducting inference based on SGD for high-dimensional linear regression. Using a variant of the SGD algorithm, we construct a debiased estimator of each regression coefficient that is asymptotically normal. This gives a one-pass algorithm for computing both the sparse regression coefficient estimator and confidence intervals, which is computationally attractive and applicable to online data.

1303.6938v1	We propose a novel approach for nonlinear regression using a two-layer neural network (NN) model structure with sparsity-favoring hierarchical priors on the network weights. We present an expectation propagation (EP) approach for approximate integration over the posterior distribution of the weights, the hierarchical scale parameters of the priors, and the residual scale. Using a factorized posterior approximation we derive a computationally efficient algorithm, whose complexity scales similarly to an ensemble of independent sparse linear models. The approach enables flexible definition of weight priors with different sparseness properties such as independent Laplace priors with a common scale parameter or Gaussian automatic relevance determination (ARD) priors with different relevance parameters for all inputs. The approach can be extended beyond standard activation functions and NN model structures to form flexible nonlinear predictors from multiple sparse linear models. The effects of the hierarchical priors and the predictive performance of the algorithm are assessed using both simulated and real-world data. Comparisons are made to two alternative models with ARD priors: a Gaussian process with a NN covariance function and marginal maximum a posteriori estimates of the relevance parameters, and a NN with Markov chain Monte Carlo integration over all the unknown model parameters.

1506.01418v2	For large matrix factorisation problems, we develop a distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method based on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) that we call Parallel SGLD (PSGLD). PSGLD has very favourable scaling properties with increasing data size and is comparable in terms of computational requirements to optimisation methods based on stochastic gradient descent. PSGLD achieves high performance by exploiting the conditional independence structure of the MF models to sub-sample data in a systematic manner as to allow parallelisation and distributed computation. We provide a convergence proof of the algorithm and verify its superior performance on various architectures such as Graphics Processing Units, shared memory multi-core systems and multi-computer clusters.

1611.04208v3	It has been proposed that complex populations, such as those that arise in genomics studies, may exhibit dependencies among observations as well as among variables. This gives rise to the challenging problem of analyzing unreplicated high-dimensional data with unknown mean and dependence structures. Matrix-variate approaches that impose various forms of (inverse) covariance sparsity allow flexible dependence structures to be estimated, but cannot directly be applied when the mean and covariance matrices are estimated jointly. We present a practical method utilizing generalized least squares and penalized (inverse) covariance estimation to address this challenge. We establish consistency and obtain rates of convergence for estimating the mean parameters and covariance matrices. The advantages of our approaches are: (i) dependence graphs and covariance structures can be estimated in the presence of unknown mean structure, (ii) the mean structure becomes more efficiently estimated when accounting for the dependence structure among observations; and (iii) inferences about the mean parameters become correctly calibrated. We use simulation studies and analysis of genomic data from a twin study of ulcerative colitis to illustrate the statistical convergence and the performance of our methods in practical settings. Several lines of evidence show that the test statistics for differential gene expression produced by our methods are correctly calibrated and improve power over conventional methods.

1205.2628v1	This paper presents a novel theoretical study of the general problem of multiple source adaptation using the notion of Renyi divergence. Our results build on our previous work [12], but significantly broaden the scope of that work in several directions. We extend previous multiple source loss guarantees based on distribution weighted combinations to arbitrary target distributions P, not necessarily mixtures of the source distributions, analyze both known and unknown target distribution cases, and prove a lower bound. We further extend our bounds to deal with the case where the learner receives an approximate distribution for each source instead of the exact one, and show that similar loss guarantees can be achieved depending on the divergence between the approximate and true distributions. We also analyze the case where the labeling functions of the source domains are somewhat different. Finally, we report the results of experiments with both an artificial data set and a sentiment analysis task, showing the performance benefits of the distribution weighted combinations and the quality of our bounds based on the Renyi divergence.

1203.3486v1	We introduce a new graphical model for tracking radio-tagged animals and learning their movement patterns. The model provides a principled way to combine radio telemetry data with an arbitrary set of userdefined, spatial features. We describe an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for fitting model parameters to data and demonstrate its effectiveness via asymptotic analysis and synthetic experiments. We also apply our model to real datasets, and show that it outperforms the most popular radio telemetry software package used in ecology. We conclude that integration of different data sources under a single statistical framework, coupled with appropriate parameter and state estimation procedures, produces both accurate location estimates and an interpretable statistical model of animal movement.

0805.2744v3	"Data analysis and data mining are concerned with unsupervised pattern finding and structure determination in data sets. The data sets themselves are explicitly linked as a form of representation to an observational or otherwise empirical domain of interest. ""Structure"" has long been understood as symmetry which can take many forms with respect to any transformation, including point, translational, rotational, and many others. Beginning with the role of number theory in expressing data, we show how we can naturally proceed to hierarchical structures. We show how this both encapsulates traditional paradigms in data analysis, and also opens up new perspectives towards issues that are on the order of the day, including data mining of massive, high dimensional, heterogeneous data sets. Linkages with other fields are also discussed including computational logic and symbolic dynamics. The structures in data surveyed here are based on hierarchy, represented as p-adic numbers or an ultrametric topology."	Symmetry in Data Mining and Analysis: A Unifying View based on Hierarchy
1708.02883v2	Consider a structured matrix factorization model where one factor is restricted to have its columns lying in the unit simplex. This simplex-structured matrix factorization (SSMF) model and the associated factorization techniques have spurred much interest in research topics over different areas, such as hyperspectral unmixing in remote sensing, topic discovery in machine learning, to name a few. In this paper we develop a new theoretical SSMF framework whose idea is to study a maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed in the convex hull of the data points. This maximum volume inscribed ellipsoid (MVIE) idea has not been attempted in prior literature, and we show a sufficient condition under which the MVIE framework guarantees exact recovery of the factors. The sufficient recovery condition we show for MVIE is much more relaxed than that of separable non-negative matrix factorization (or pure-pixel search); coincidentally it is also identical to that of minimum volume enclosing simplex, which is known to be a powerful SSMF framework for non-separable problem instances. We also show that MVIE can be practically implemented by performing facet enumeration and then by solving a convex optimization problem. The potential of the MVIE framework is illustrated by numerical results.

1703.01536v1	Yield curve forecasting is an important problem in finance. In this work we explore the use of Gaussian Processes in conjunction with a dynamic modeling strategy, much like the Kalman Filter, to model the yield curve. Gaussian Processes have been successfully applied to model functional data in a variety of applications. A Gaussian Process is used to model the yield curve. The hyper-parameters of the Gaussian Process model are updated as the algorithm receives yield curve data. Yield curve data is typically available as a time series with a frequency of one day. We compare existing methods to forecast the yield curve with the proposed method. The results of this study showed that while a competing method (a multivariate time series method) performed well in forecasting the yields at the short term structure region of the yield curve, Gaussian Processes perform well in the medium and long term structure regions of the yield curve. Accuracy in the long term structure region of the yield curve has important practical implications. The Gaussian Process framework yields uncertainty and probability estimates directly in contrast to other competing methods. Analysts are frequently interested in this information. In this study the proposed method has been applied to yield curve forecasting, however it can be applied to model high frequency time series data or data streams in other domains.

1607.07573v1	"Mixture models with Gamma and or inverse-Gamma distributed mixture components are useful for medical image tissue segmentation or as post-hoc models for regression coefficients obtained from linear regression within a Generalised Linear Modeling framework (GLM), used in this case to separate stochastic (Gaussian) noise from some kind of positive or negative ""activation"" (modeled as Gamma or inverse-Gamma distributed). To date, the most common choice in this context it is Gaussian/Gamma mixture models learned through a maximum likelihood (ML) approach; we recently extended such algorithm for mixture models with inverse-Gamma components. Here, we introduce a fully analytical Variational Bayes (VB) learning framework for both Gamma and/or inverse-Gamma components. We use synthetic and resting state fMRI data to compare the performance of the ML and VB algorithms in terms of area under the curve and computational cost. We observed that the ML Gaussian/Gamma model is very expensive specially when considering high resolution images; furthermore, these solutions are highly variable and they occasionally can overestimate the activations severely. The Bayesian Gauss-Gamma is in general the fastest algorithm but provides too dense solutions. The maximum likelihood Gaussian/inverse-Gamma is also very fast but provides in general very sparse solutions. The variational Gaussian/inverse-Gamma mixture model is the most robust and its cost is acceptable even for high resolution images. Further, the presented methodology represents an essential building block that can be directly used in more complex inference tasks, specially designed to analyse MRI-fMRI data; such models include for example analytical variational mixture models with adaptive spatial regularization or better source models for new spatial blind source separation approaches."

1306.1043v2	Causal inference relies on the structure of a graph, often a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Different graphs may result in different causal inference statements and different intervention distributions. To quantify such differences, we propose a (pre-) distance between DAGs, the structural intervention distance (SID). The SID is based on a graphical criterion only and quantifies the closeness between two DAGs in terms of their corresponding causal inference statements. It is therefore well-suited for evaluating graphs that are used for computing interventions. Instead of DAGs it is also possible to compare CPDAGs, completed partially directed acyclic graphs that represent Markov equivalence classes. Since it differs significantly from the popular Structural Hamming Distance (SHD), the SID constitutes a valuable additional measure. We discuss properties of this distance and provide an efficient implementation with software code available on the first author's homepage (an R package is under construction).

1310.8618v1	The kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm is an appealing tool for online identification of nonlinear systems due to its simplicity and robustness. In addition to choosing a reproducing kernel and setting filter parameters, designing a KLMS adaptive filter requires to select a so-called dictionary in order to get a finite-order model. This dictionary has a significant impact on performance, and requires careful consideration. Theoretical analysis of KLMS as a function of dictionary setting has rarely, if ever, been addressed in the literature. In an analysis previously published by the authors, the dictionary elements were assumed to be governed by the same probability density function of the input data. In this paper, we modify this study by considering the dictionary as part of the filter parameters to be set. This theoretical analysis paves the way for future investigations on KLMS dictionary design.	Convergence analysis of kernel LMS algorithm with pre-tuned dictionary
1405.0558v2	"We study a novel spline-like basis, which we name the ""falling factorial basis"", bearing many similarities to the classic truncated power basis. The advantage of the falling factorial basis is that it enables rapid, linear-time computations in basis matrix multiplication and basis matrix inversion. The falling factorial functions are not actually splines, but are close enough to splines that they provably retain some of the favorable properties of the latter functions. We examine their application in two problems: trend filtering over arbitrary input points, and a higher-order variant of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test."

1203.3521v1	Recent reports have described that the equivalent sample size (ESS) in a Dirichlet prior plays an important role in learning Bayesian networks. This paper provides an asymptotic analysis of the marginal likelihood score for a Bayesian network. Results show that the ratio of the ESS and sample size determine the penalty of adding arcs in learning Bayesian networks. The number of arcs increases monotonically as the ESS increases; the number of arcs monotonically decreases as the ESS decreases. Furthermore, the marginal likelihood score provides a unified expression of various score metrics by changing prior knowledge.	Learning networks determined by the ratio of prior and data
1005.0437v1	Recent research on multiple kernel learning has lead to a number of approaches for combining kernels in regularized risk minimization. The proposed approaches include different formulations of objectives and varying regularization strategies. In this paper we present a unifying general optimization criterion for multiple kernel learning and show how existing formulations are subsumed as special cases. We also derive the criterion's dual representation, which is suitable for general smooth optimization algorithms. Finally, we evaluate multiple kernel learning in this framework analytically using a Rademacher complexity bound on the generalization error and empirically in a set of experiments.

1709.05506v2	This paper introduces a latent position network model, called the generalised random dot product graph, comprising as special cases the stochastic blockmodel, mixed membership stochastic blockmodel, and random dot product graph. In this model, nodes are represented as random vectors on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and the probability of an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ is given by the bilinear form $X_i^T I_{p,q} X_j$, where $I_{p,q} = \mathrm{diag}(1,\ldots, 1, -1, \ldots, -1)$ with $p$ ones and $q$ minus ones, where $p+q=d$. As we show, this provides the only possible representation of nodes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that mixed membership is encoded as the corresponding convex combination of latent positions. The positions are identifiable only up to transformation in the indefinite orthogonal group $O(p,q)$, and we discuss some consequences for typical follow-on inference tasks, such as clustering and prediction.

1512.08643v2	Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences in GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample settings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently challenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso, whose distribution can be characterized in an efficient manner. We then show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in GGMs. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism.

1710.05050v1	Reliable measures of statistical dependence could be useful tools for learning independent features and performing tasks like source separation using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Unfortunately, many of such measures, like the mutual information, are hard to estimate and optimize directly. We propose to learn independent features with adversarial objectives which optimize such measures implicitly. These objectives compare samples from the joint distribution and the product of the marginals without the need to compute any probability densities. We also propose two methods for obtaining samples from the product of the marginals using either a simple resampling trick or a separate parametric distribution. Our experiments show that this strategy can easily be applied to different types of model architectures and solve both linear and non-linear ICA problems.

1202.3714v1	The personalization of treatment via bio-markers and other risk categories has drawn increasing interest among clinical scientists. Personalized treatment strategies can be learned using data from clinical trials, but such trials are very costly to run. This paper explores the use of active learning techniques to design more efficient trials, addressing issues such as whom to recruit, at what point in the trial, and which treatment to assign, throughout the duration of the trial. We propose a minimax bandit model with two different optimization criteria, and discuss the computational challenges and issues pertaining to this approach. We evaluate our active learning policies using both simulated data, and data modeled after a clinical trial for treating depressed individuals, and contrast our methods with other plausible active learning policies.

1802.08404v1	We propose a novel approach to parameter estimation for simulator-based statistical models with intractable likelihoods. The proposed method is recursive application of kernel ABC and kernel herding to the same observed data. We provide a theoretical explanation regarding why this approach works, showing (for the population setting) that the point estimate obtained with this method converges to the true parameter as recursion proceeds, under a certain assumption. We conduct a variety of numerical experiments, including parameter estimation for a real-world pedestrian flow simulator, and show that our method outperforms existing approaches in most cases.

1709.06557v1	"Kernel-based learning algorithms are widely used in machine learning for problems that make use of the similarity between object pairs. Such algorithms first embed all data points into an alternative space, where the inner product between object pairs specifies their distance in the embedding space. Applying kernel methods to partially labeled datasets is a classical challenge in this regard, requiring that the distances between unlabeled pairs must somehow be learnt using the labeled data. In this independent study, I will summarize the work of G. Lanckriet et al.'s work on ""Learning the Kernel Matrix with Semidefinite Programming"" used in support vector machines (SVM) algorithms for the transduction problem.

1009.5358v2	Modeling data with linear combinations of a few elements from a learned dictionary has been the focus of much recent research in machine learning, neuroscience and signal processing. For signals such as natural images that admit such sparse representations, it is now well established that these models are well suited to restoration tasks. In this context, learning the dictionary amounts to solving a large-scale matrix factorization problem, which can be done efficiently with classical optimization tools. The same approach has also been used for learning features from data for other purposes, e.g., image classification, but tuning the dictionary in a supervised way for these tasks has proven to be more difficult. In this paper, we present a general formulation for supervised dictionary learning adapted to a wide variety of tasks, and present an efficient algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Experiments on handwritten digit classification, digital art identification, nonlinear inverse image problems, and compressed sensing demonstrate that our approach is effective in large-scale settings, and is well suited to supervised and semi-supervised classification, as well as regression tasks for data that admit sparse representations.

1706.00182v1	Minimizing the empirical risk is a popular training strategy, but for learning tasks where the data may be noisy or heavy-tailed, one may require many observations in order to generalize well. To achieve better performance under less stringent requirements, we introduce a procedure which constructs a robust approximation of the risk gradient for use in an iterative learning routine. We provide high-probability bounds on the excess risk of this algorithm, by showing that it does not deviate far from the ideal gradient-based update. Empirical tests show that in diverse settings, the proposed procedure can learn more efficiently, using less resources (iterations and observations) while generalizing better.

1408.1336v2	This paper generalizes an important result from the PAC-Bayesian literature for binary classification to the case of ensemble methods for structured outputs. We prove a generic version of the \Cbound, an upper bound over the risk of models expressed as a weighted majority vote that is based on the first and second statistical moments of the vote's margin. This bound may advantageously $(i)$ be applied on more complex outputs such as multiclass labels and multilabel, and $(ii)$ allow to consider margin relaxations. These results open the way to develop new ensemble methods for structured output prediction with PAC-Bayesian guarantees.	On the Generalization of the C-Bound to Structured Output Ensemble  Methods
1101.5184v3	In literature there are several studies on the performance of Bayesian network structure learning algorithms. The focus of these studies is almost always the heuristics the learning algorithms are based on, i.e. the maximisation algorithms (in score-based algorithms) or the techniques for learning the dependencies of each variable (in constraint-based algorithms). In this paper we investigate how the use of permutation tests instead of parametric ones affects the performance of Bayesian network structure learning from discrete data. Shrinkage tests are also covered to provide a broad overview of the techniques developed in current literature.	Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Permutation Tests
1410.8229v4	In this paper we introduce a new optimization formulation for sparse regression and compressed sensing, called CLOT (Combined L-One and Two), wherein the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-norms. This formulation differs from the Elastic Net (EN) formulation, in which the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-norm squared. It is shown that, in the context of compressed sensing, the EN formulation does not achieve robust recovery of sparse vectors, whereas the new CLOT formulation achieves robust recovery. Also, like EN but unlike LASSO, the CLOT formulation achieves the grouping effect, wherein coefficients of highly correlated columns of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned roughly comparable values. It is already known LASSO does not have the grouping effect. Therefore the CLOT formulation combines the best features of both LASSO (robust sparse recovery) and EN (grouping effect). The CLOT formulation is a special case of another one called SGL (Sparse Group LASSO) which was introduced into the literature previously, but without any analysis of either the grouping effect or robust sparse recovery. It is shown here that SGL achieves robust sparse recovery, and also achieves a version of the grouping effect in that coefficients of highly correlated columns belonging to the same group of the measurement (or design) matrix are assigned roughly comparable values.	Two New Approaches to Compressed Sensing Exhibiting Both Robust Sparse  Recovery and the Grouping Effect
1607.06534v3	Most high-dimensional estimation and prediction methods propose to minimize a cost function (empirical risk) that is written as a sum of losses associated to each data point. In this paper we focus on the case of non-convex losses, which is practically important but still poorly understood. Classical empirical process theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting M-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently. In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to study the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and their properties. We establish uniform convergence of the gradient and Hessian of the empirical risk to their population counterparts, as soon as the number of samples becomes larger than the number of unknown parameters (modulo logarithmic factors). Consequently, good properties of the population risk can be carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one correspondence of their stationary points. We demonstrate that in several problems such as non-convex binary classification, robust regression, and Gaussian mixture model, this result implies a complete characterization of the landscape of the empirical risk, and of the convergence properties of descent algorithms. We extend our analysis to the very high-dimensional setting in which the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, and provide a characterization of the empirical risk landscape under a nearly information-theoretically minimal condition. Namely, if the number of samples exceeds the sparsity of the unknown parameters vector (modulo logarithmic factors), then a suitable uniform convergence result takes place. We apply this result to non-convex binary classification and robust regression in very high-dimension.	The Landscape of Empirical Risk for Non-convex Losses
1705.01305v1	This paper aims at formulating the issue of ranking multivariate unlabeled observations depending on their degree of abnormality as an unsupervised statistical learning task. In the 1-d situation, this problem is usually tackled by means of tail estimation techniques: univariate observations are viewed as all the more 'abnormal' as they are located far in the tail(s) of the underlying probability distribution. It would be desirable as well to dispose of a scalar valued 'scoring' function allowing for comparing the degree of abnormality of mul-tivariate observations. Here we formulate the issue of scoring anomalies as a M-estimation problem by means of a novel functional performance criterion, referred to as the Mass Volume curve (MV curve in short), whose optimal elements are strictly increasing transforms of the density. We first study the statistical estimation of the MV curve of a given scoring function and we provide a strategy to build confidence regions using a smoothed bootstrap approach. Optimization of this functional criterion over the set of piecewise constant scoring functions is next tackled. This boils down to estimating a sequence of empirical minimum volume sets whose levels are chosen adaptively from the data, so as to adjust to the variations of the optimal MV curve, while controling the bias of its approximation by a stepwise curve. Generalization bounds are then established for the difference in sup norm between the MV curve of the empirical scoring function thus obtained and the optimal MV curve.	Mass Volume Curves and Anomaly Ranking
1412.8765v2	We consider the problem of uncertainty assessment for low dimensional components in high dimensional models. Specifically, we propose a decorrelated score function to handle the impact of high dimensional nuisance parameters. We consider both hypothesis tests and confidence regions for generic penalized M-estimators. Unlike most existing inferential methods which are tailored for individual models, our approach provides a general framework for high dimensional inference and is applicable to a wide range of applications. From the testing perspective, we develop general theorems to characterize the limiting distributions of the decorrelated score test statistic under both null hypothesis and local alternatives. These results provide asymptotic guarantees on the type I errors and local powers of the proposed test. Furthermore, we show that the decorrelated score function can be used to construct point and confidence region estimators that are semiparametrically efficient. We also generalize this framework to broaden its applications. First, we extend it to handle high dimensional null hypothesis, where the number of parameters of interest can increase exponentially fast with the sample size. Second, we establish the theory for model misspecification. Third, we go beyond the likelihood framework, by introducing the generalized score test based on general loss functions. Thorough numerical studies are conducted to back up the developed theoretical results.	A General Theory of Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Regions for Sparse  High Dimensional Models
1701.03755v1	More and more processes governing our lives use in some part an automatic decision step, where -- based on a feature vector derived from an applicant -- an algorithm has the decision power over the final outcome. Here we present a simple idea which gives some of the power back to the applicant by providing her with alternatives which would make the decision algorithm decide differently. It is based on a formalization reminiscent of methods used for evasion attacks, and consists in enumerating the subspaces where the classifiers decides the desired output. This has been implemented for the specific case of decision forests (ensemble methods based on decision trees), mapping the problem to an iterative version of enumerating $k$-cliques.

1610.00189v1	Bayesian networks (BNs) are graphical models that are useful for representing high-dimensional probability distributions. There has been a great deal of interest in recent years in the NP-hard problem of learning the structure of a BN from observed data. Typically, one assigns a score to various structures and the search becomes an optimization problem that can be approached with either deterministic or stochastic methods. In this paper, we walk through the space of graphs by modeling the appearance and disappearance of edges as a birth and death process and compare our novel approach to the popular Metropolis-Hastings search strategy. We give empirical evidence that the birth and death process has superior mixing properties.	A Birth and Death Process for Bayesian Network Structure Inference
1702.07254v1	Learning rates for regularized least-squares algorithms are in most cases expressed with respect to the excess risk, or equivalently, the $L_2$-norm. For some applications, however, guarantees with respect to stronger norms such as the $L_\infty$-norm, are desirable. We address this problem by establishing learning rates for a continuous scale of norms between the $L_2$- and the RKHS norm. As a byproduct we derive $L_\infty$-norm learning rates, and in the case of Sobolev RKHSs we actually obtain Sobolev norm learning rates, which may also imply $L_\infty$-norm rates for some derivatives. In all cases, we do not need to assume the target function to be contained in the used RKHS. Finally, we show that in many cases the derived rates are minimax optimal.

1510.03497v1	We consider the problem of extracting a low-dimensional, linear latent variable structure from high-dimensional random variables. Specifically, we show that under mild conditions and when this structure manifests itself as a linear space that spans the conditional means, it is possible to consistently recover the structure using only information up to the second moments of these random variables. This finding, specialized to one-parameter exponential families whose variance function is quadratic in their means, allows for the derivation of an explicit estimator of such latent structure. This approach serves as a latent variable model estimator and as a tool for dimension reduction for a high-dimensional matrix of data composed of many related variables. Our theoretical results are verified by simulation studies and an application to genomic data.	Consistent Estimation of Low-Dimensional Latent Structure in  High-Dimensional Data
1612.09466v3	Joint blind source separation (J-BSS) is an emerging data-driven technique for multi-set data-fusion. In this paper, J-BSS is addressed from a tensorial perspective. We show how, by using second-order multi-set statistics in J-BSS, a specific double coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (DC-CPD) problem can be formulated. We propose an algebraic DC-CPD algorithm based on a coupled rank-1 detection mapping. This algorithm converts a possibly underdetermined DC-CPD to a set of overdetermined CPDs. The latter can be solved algebraically via a generalized eigenvalue decomposition based scheme. Therefore, this algorithm is deterministic and returns the exact solution in the noiseless case. In the noisy case, it can be used to effectively initialize optimization based DC-CPD algorithms. In addition, we obtain the determini- stic and generic uniqueness conditions for DC-CPD, which are shown to be more relaxed than their CPD counterpart. Experiment results are given to illustrate the superiority of DC-CPD over standard CPD based BSS methods and several existing J-BSS methods, with regards to uniqueness and accuracy.

1103.5537v2	The discovery of non-linear causal relationship under additive non-Gaussian noise models has attracted considerable attention recently because of their high flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference algorithm called least-squares independence regression (LSIR). LSIR learns the additive noise model through the minimization of an estimator of the squared-loss mutual information between inputs and residuals. A notable advantage of LSIR over existing approaches is that tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be naturally optimized by cross-validation, allowing us to avoid overfitting in a data-dependent fashion. Through experiments with real-world datasets, we show that LSIR compares favorably with a state-of-the-art causal inference method.

1711.11216v1	We develop Riemannian Stein Variational Gradient Descent (RSVGD), a Bayesian inference method that generalizes Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to Riemann manifold. The benefits are two-folds: (i) for inference tasks in Euclidean spaces, RSVGD has the advantage over SVGD of utilizing information geometry, and (ii) for inference tasks on Riemann manifolds, RSVGD brings the unique advantages of SVGD to the Riemannian world. To appropriately transfer to Riemann manifolds, we conceive novel and non-trivial techniques for RSVGD, which are required by the intrinsically different characteristics of general Riemann manifolds from Euclidean spaces. We also discover Riemannian Stein's Identity and Riemannian Kernelized Stein Discrepancy. Experimental results show the advantages over SVGD of exploring distribution geometry and the advantages of particle-efficiency, iteration-effectiveness and approximation flexibility over other inference methods on Riemann manifolds.

1110.4322v3	We provide the first algorithm for online bandit linear optimization whose regret after T rounds is of order sqrt{Td ln N} on any finite class X of N actions in d dimensions, and of order d*sqrt{T} (up to log factors) when X is infinite. These bounds are not improvable in general. The basic idea utilizes tools from convex geometry to construct what is essentially an optimal exploration basis. We also present an application to a model of linear bandits with expert advice. Interestingly, these results show that bandit linear optimization with expert advice in d dimensions is no more difficult (in terms of the achievable regret) than the online d-armed bandit problem with expert advice (where EXP4 is optimal).

1101.4179v3	Clustering with fast algorithms large samples of high dimensional data is an important challenge in computational statistics. Borrowing ideas from MacQueen (1967) who introduced a sequential version of the $k$-means algorithm, a new class of recursive stochastic gradient algorithms designed for the $k$-medians loss criterion is proposed. By their recursive nature, these algorithms are very fast and are well adapted to deal with large samples of data that are allowed to arrive sequentially. It is proved that the stochastic gradient algorithm converges almost surely to the set of stationary points of the underlying loss criterion. A particular attention is paid to the averaged versions, which are known to have better performances, and a data-driven procedure that allows automatic selection of the value of the descent step is proposed. The performance of the averaged sequential estimator is compared on a simulation study, both in terms of computation speed and accuracy of the estimations, with more classical partitioning techniques such as $k$-means, trimmed $k$-means and PAM (partitioning around medoids). Finally, this new online clustering technique is illustrated on determining television audience profiles with a sample of more than 5000 individual television audiences measured every minute over a period of 24 hours.

1401.8017v1	This paper is about variable selection, clustering and estimation in an unsupervised high-dimensional setting. Our approach is based on fitting constrained Gaussian mixture models, where we learn the number of clusters $K$ and the set of relevant variables $S$ using a generalized Bayesian posterior with a sparsity inducing prior. We prove a sparsity oracle inequality which shows that this procedure selects the optimal parameters $K$ and $S$. This procedure is implemented using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, based on a clustering-oriented greedy proposal, which makes the convergence to the posterior very fast.	Sparse Bayesian Unsupervised Learning
1503.01442v2	Many high dimensional sparse learning problems are formulated as nonconvex optimization. A popular approach to solve these nonconvex optimization problems is through convex relaxations such as linear and semidefinite programming. In this paper, we study the statistical limits of convex relaxations. Particularly, we consider two problems: Mean estimation for sparse principal submatrix and edge probability estimation for stochastic block model. We exploit the sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy to sharply characterize the limits of a broad class of convex relaxations. Our result shows statistical optimality needs to be compromised for achieving computational tractability using convex relaxations. Compared with existing results on computational lower bounds for statistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like planted clique detection, our theory focuses on a broad class of convex relaxations and does not rely on unproven hypotheses.	Statistical Limits of Convex Relaxations
1106.0539v2	The beta-Bernoulli process provides a Bayesian nonparametric prior for models involving collections of binary-valued features. A draw from the beta process yields an infinite collection of probabilities in the unit interval, and a draw from the Bernoulli process turns these into binary-valued features. Recent work has provided stick-breaking representations for the beta process analogous to the well-known stick-breaking representation for the Dirichlet process. We derive one such stick-breaking representation directly from the characterization of the beta process as a completely random measure. This approach motivates a three-parameter generalization of the beta process, and we study the power laws that can be obtained from this generalized beta process. We present a posterior inference algorithm for the beta-Bernoulli process that exploits the stick-breaking representation, and we present experimental results for a discrete factor-analysis model.	Beta processes, stick-breaking, and power laws
1006.4338v2	In this paper we study convex stochastic search problems where a noisy objective function value is observed after a decision is made. There are many stochastic search problems whose behavior depends on an exogenous state variable which affects the shape of the objective function. Currently, there is no general purpose algorithm to solve this class of problems. We use nonparametric density estimation to take observations from the joint state-outcome distribution and use them to infer the optimal decision for a given query state. We propose two solution methods that depend on the problem characteristics: function-based and gradient-based optimization. We examine two weighting schemes, kernel-based weights and Dirichlet process-based weights, for use with the solution methods. The weights and solution methods are tested on a synthetic multi-product newsvendor problem and the hour-ahead wind commitment problem. Our results show that in some cases Dirichlet process weights offer substantial benefits over kernel based weights and more generally that nonparametric estimation methods provide good solutions to otherwise intractable problems.

1703.03216v3	Density ratio estimation is a vital tool in both machine learning and statistical community. However, due to the unbounded nature of density ratio, the estimation procedure can be vulnerable to corrupted data points, which often pushes the estimated ratio toward infinity. In this paper, we present a robust estimator which automatically identifies and trims outliers. The proposed estimator has a convex formulation, and the global optimum can be obtained via subgradient descent. We analyze the parameter estimation error of this estimator under high-dimensional settings. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the estimator.	Trimmed Density Ratio Estimation
0906.5263v1	The problem of multiple hypothesis testing arises when there are more than one hypothesis to be tested simultaneously for statistical significance. This is a very common situation in many data mining applications. For instance, assessing simultaneously the significance of all frequent itemsets of a single dataset entails a host of hypothesis, one for each itemset. A multiple hypothesis testing method is needed to control the number of false positives (Type I error). Our contribution in this paper is to extend the multiple hypothesis framework to be used with a generic data mining algorithm. We provide a method that provably controls the family-wise error rate (FWER, the probability of at least one false positive) in the strong sense. We evaluate the performance of our solution on both real and generated data. The results show that our method controls the FWER while maintaining the power of the test.	Multiple Hypothesis Testing in Pattern Discovery
1308.5712v1	Reshef & Reshef recently published a paper in which they present a method called the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) that can detect all forms of statistical dependence between pairs of variables as sample size goes to infinity. While this method has been praised by some, it has also been criticized for its lack of power in finite samples. We seek to modify MIC so that it has higher power in detecting associations for limited sample sizes. Here we present the Generalized Mean Information Coefficient (GMIC), a generalization of MIC which incorporates a tuning parameter that can be used to modify the complexity of the association favored by the measure. We define GMIC and prove it maintains several key asymptotic properties of MIC. Its increased power over MIC is demonstrated using a simulation of eight different functional relationships at sixty different noise levels. The results are compared to the Pearson correlation, distance correlation, and MIC. Simulation results suggest that while generally GMIC has slightly lower power than the distance correlation measure, it achieves higher power than MIC for many forms of underlying association. For some functional relationships, GMIC surpasses all other statistics calculated. Preliminary results suggest choosing a moderate value of the tuning parameter for GMIC will yield a test that is robust across underlying relationships. GMIC is a promising new method that mitigates the power issues suffered by MIC, at the possible expense of equitability. Nonetheless, distance correlation was in our simulations more powerful for many forms of underlying relationships. At a minimum, this work motivates further consideration of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) methods as statistical tests of independence.	The Generalized Mean Information Coefficient
0910.0115v1	Many inference problems involving questions of optimality ask for the maximum or the minimum of a finite set of unknown quantities. This technical report derives the first two posterior moments of the maximum of two correlated Gaussian variables and the first two posterior moments of the two generating variables (corresponding to Gaussian approximations minimizing relative entropy). It is shown how this can be used to build a heuristic approximation to the maximum relationship over a finite set of Gaussian variables, allowing approximate inference by Expectation Propagation on such quantities.

1104.3476v1	In the field of structural reliability, the Monte-Carlo estimator is considered as the reference probability estimator. However, it is still untractable for real engineering cases since it requires a high number of runs of the model. In order to reduce the number of computer experiments, many other approaches known as reliability methods have been proposed. A certain approach consists in replacing the original experiment by a surrogate which is much faster to evaluate. Nevertheless, it is often difficult (or even impossible) to quantify the error made by this substitution. In this paper an alternative approach is developed. It takes advantage of the kriging meta-modeling and importance sampling techniques. The proposed alternative estimator is finally applied to a finite element based structural reliability analysis.	Metamodel-based importance sampling for the simulation of rare events
1411.0439v1	We propose a novel sampling framework for inference in probabilistic models: an active learning approach that converges more quickly (in wall-clock time) than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) benchmarks. The central challenge in probabilistic inference is numerical integration, to average over ensembles of models or unknown (hyper-)parameters (for example to compute the marginal likelihood or a partition function). MCMC has provided approaches to numerical integration that deliver state-of-the-art inference, but can suffer from sample inefficiency and poor convergence diagnostics. Bayesian quadrature techniques offer a model-based solution to such problems, but their uptake has been hindered by prohibitive computation costs. We introduce a warped model for probabilistic integrands (likelihoods) that are known to be non-negative, permitting a cheap active learning scheme to optimally select sample locations. Our algorithm is demonstrated to offer faster convergence (in seconds) relative to simple Monte Carlo and annealed importance sampling on both synthetic and real-world examples.

1507.03228v1	Networks capture our intuition about relationships in the world. They describe the friendships between Facebook users, interactions in financial markets, and synapses connecting neurons in the brain. These networks are richly structured with cliques of friends, sectors of stocks, and a smorgasbord of cell types that govern how neurons connect. Some networks, like social network friendships, can be directly observed, but in many cases we only have an indirect view of the network through the actions of its constituents and an understanding of how the network mediates that activity. In this work, we focus on the problem of latent network discovery in the case where the observable activity takes the form of a mutually-excitatory point process known as a Hawkes process. We build on previous work that has taken a Bayesian approach to this problem, specifying prior distributions over the latent network structure and a likelihood of observed activity given this network. We extend this work by proposing a discrete-time formulation and developing a computationally efficient stochastic variational inference (SVI) algorithm that allows us to scale the approach to long sequences of observations. We demonstrate our algorithm on the calcium imaging data used in the Chalearn neural connectomics challenge.	Scalable Bayesian Inference for Excitatory Point Process Networks
1003.1954v2	We present simple and computationally efficient nonparametric estimators of R\'enyi entropy and mutual information based on an i.i.d. sample drawn from an unknown, absolutely continuous distribution over $\R^d$. The estimators are calculated as the sum of $p$-th powers of the Euclidean lengths of the edges of the `generalized nearest-neighbor' graph of the sample and the empirical copula of the sample respectively. For the first time, we prove the almost sure consistency of these estimators and upper bounds on their rates of convergence, the latter of which under the assumption that the density underlying the sample is Lipschitz continuous. Experiments demonstrate their usefulness in independent subspace analysis.	Estimation of Rényi Entropy and Mutual Information Based on  Generalized Nearest-Neighbor Graphs
1311.1033v2	Analyzing and understanding the structure of complex relational data is important in many applications including analysis of the connectivity in the human brain. Such networks can have prominent patterns on different scales, calling for a hierarchically structured model. We propose two non-parametric Bayesian hierarchical network models based on Gibbs fragmentation tree priors, and demonstrate their ability to capture nested patterns in simulated networks. On real networks we demonstrate detection of hierarchical structure and show predictive performance on par with the state of the art. We envision that our methods can be employed in exploratory analysis of large scale complex networks for example to model human brain connectivity.

1710.01163v1	We consider the problem of solving a large-scale Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program. Such problems occur naturally in many scientific and web applications. Although there are efficient methods which tackle this problem, they are mostly not scalable. In this paper, we develop a method that transforms the quadratic constraint into a linear form by sampling a set of low-discrepancy points. The transformed problem can then be solved by applying any state-of-the-art large-scale quadratic programming solvers. We show the convergence of our approximate solution to the true solution as well as some finite sample error bounds. Experimental results are also shown to prove scalability as well as improved quality of approximation in practice.	Large-Scale Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program via  Low-Discrepancy Sequences
1502.05312v2	Unknown constraints arise in many types of expensive black-box optimization problems. Several methods have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian optimization with constraints, based on the expected improvement (EI) heuristic. However, EI can lead to pathologies when used with constraints. For example, in the case of decoupled constraints---i.e., when one can independently evaluate the objective or the constraints---EI can encounter a pathology that prevents exploration. Additionally, computing EI requires a current best solution, which may not exist if none of the data collected so far satisfy the constraints. By contrast, information-based approaches do not suffer from these failure modes. In this paper, we present a new information-based method called Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). We analyze the performance of PESC and show that it compares favorably to EI-based approaches on synthetic and benchmark problems, as well as several real-world examples. We demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization.

1203.0203v1	The use of Reinforcement Learning in real-world scenarios is strongly limited by issues of scale. Most RL learning algorithms are unable to deal with problems composed of hundreds or sometimes even dozens of possible actions, and therefore cannot be applied to many real-world problems. We consider the RL problem in the supervised classification framework where the optimal policy is obtained through a multiclass classifier, the set of classes being the set of actions of the problem. We introduce error-correcting output codes (ECOCs) in this setting and propose two new methods for reducing complexity when using rollouts-based approaches. The first method consists in using an ECOC-based classifier as the multiclass classifier, reducing the learning complexity from O(A2) to O(Alog(A)). We then propose a novel method that profits from the ECOC's coding dictionary to split the initial MDP into O(log(A)) seperate two-action MDPs. This second method reduces learning complexity even further, from O(A2) to O(log(A)), thus rendering problems with large action sets tractable. We finish by experimentally demonstrating the advantages of our approach on a set of benchmark problems, both in speed and performance.

1707.04067v1	This paper presents an approach for automation of interpretable feature selection for Internet Of Things Analytics (IoTA) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Authors have conducted a survey over different people involved in different IoTA based application development tasks. The survey reveals that feature selection is the most time consuming and niche skill demanding part of the entire workflow. This paper shows how feature selection is successfully automated without sacrificing the decision making accuracy and thereby reducing the project completion time and cost of hiring expensive resources. Several pattern recognition principles and state of art (SoA) ML techniques are followed to design the overall approach for the proposed automation. Three data sets are considered to establish the proof-of-concept. Experimental results show that the proposed automation is able to reduce the time for feature selection to $2$ days instead of $4-6$ months which would have been required in absence of the automation. This reduction in time is achieved without any sacrifice in the accuracy of the decision making process. Proposed method is also compared against Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model as most of the state of the art works on IoTA uses MLP based Deep Learning. Moreover the feature selection method is compared against SoA feature reduction technique namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its variants. The results obtained show that the proposed method is effective.	Automation of Feature Engineering for IoT Analytics
1701.05306v2	Estimation of individual treatment effect in observational data is complicated due to the challenges of confounding and selection bias. A useful inferential framework to address this is the counterfactual (potential outcomes) model which takes the hypothetical stance of asking what if an individual had received both treatments. Making use of random forests (RF) within the counterfactual framework we estimate individual treatment effects by directly modeling the response. We find accurate estimation of individual treatment effects is possible even in complex heterogeneous settings but that the type of RF approach plays an important role in accuracy. Methods designed to be adaptive to confounding, when used in parallel with out-of-sample estimation, do best. One method found to be especially promising is counterfactual synthetic forests. We illustrate this new methodology by applying it to a large comparative effectiveness trial, Project Aware, in order to explore the role drug use plays in sexual risk. The analysis reveals important connections between risky behavior, drug usage, and sexual risk.	Estimating Individual Treatment Effect in Observational Data Using  Random Forest Methods
1507.05870v2	In this paper, we consider a statistical problem of learning a linear model from noisy samples. Existing work has focused on approximating the least squares solution by using leverage-based scores as an importance sampling distribution. However, no finite sample statistical guarantees and no computationally efficient optimal sampling strategies have been proposed. To evaluate the statistical properties of different sampling strategies, we propose a simple yet effective estimator, which is easy for theoretical analysis and is useful in multitask linear regression. We derive the exact mean square error of the proposed estimator for any given sampling scores. Based on minimizing the mean square error, we propose the optimal sampling scores for both estimator and predictor, and show that they are influenced by the noise-to-signal ratio. Numerical simulations match the theoretical analysis well.	A statistical perspective of sampling scores for linear regression
1202.3323v2	Mirror descent with an entropic regularizer is known to achieve shifting regret bounds that are logarithmic in the dimension. This is done using either a carefully designed projection or by a weight sharing technique. Via a novel unified analysis, we show that these two approaches deliver essentially equivalent bounds on a notion of regret generalizing shifting, adaptive, discounted, and other related regrets. Our analysis also captures and extends the generalized weight sharing technique of Bousquet and Warmuth, and can be refined in several ways, including improvements for small losses and adaptive tuning of parameters.	Mirror Descent Meets Fixed Share (and feels no regret)
1111.3781v1	In this paper, we give a new generalization error bound of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) for a general class of regularizations, and discuss what kind of regularization gives a favorable predictive accuracy. Our main target in this paper is dense type regularizations including \ellp-MKL. According to the recent numerical experiments, the sparse regularization does not necessarily show a good performance compared with dense type regularizations. Motivated by this fact, this paper gives a general theoretical tool to derive fast learning rates of MKL that is applicable to arbitrary mixed-norm-type regularizations in a unifying manner. This enables us to compare the generalization performances of various types of regularizations. As a consequence, we observe that the homogeneity of the complexities of candidate reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) affects which regularization strategy (\ell1 or dense) is preferred. In fact, in homogeneous complexity settings where the complexities of all RKHSs are evenly same, \ell1-regularization is optimal among all isotropic norms. On the other hand, in inhomogeneous complexity settings, dense type regularizations can show better learning rate than sparse \ell1-regularization. We also show that our learning rate achieves the minimax lower bound in homogeneous complexity settings.

1106.4198v1	Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is now a common tool for audio source separation. When learning NMF on large audio databases, one major drawback is that the complexity in time is O(FKN) when updating the dictionary (where (F;N) is the dimension of the input power spectrograms, and K the number of basis spectra), thus forbidding its application on signals longer than an hour. We provide an online algorithm with a complexity of O(FK) in time and memory for updates in the dictionary. We show on audio simulations that the online approach is faster for short audio signals and allows to analyze audio signals of several hours.	Online algorithms for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with the  Itakura-Saito divergence
1607.00710v2	Probabilistic programming languages represent complex data with intermingled models in a few lines of code. Efficient inference algorithms in probabilistic programming languages make possible to build unified frameworks to compute interesting probabilities of various large, real-world problems. When the structure of model is given, constructing a probabilistic program is rather straightforward. Thus, main focus have been to learn the best model parameters and compute marginal probabilities. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to build expressive probabilistic program from continue time series data when the structure of model is not given. The intuition behind of our method is to find a descriptive covariance structure of time series data in nonparametric Gaussian process regression. We report that such descriptive covariance structure efficiently derives a probabilistic programming description accurately.	Automatic Generation of Probabilistic Programming from Time Series Data
1606.08549v1	Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a framework for performing likelihood-free posterior inference for simulation models. Stochastic Variational inference (SVI) is an appealing alternative to the inefficient sampling approaches commonly used in ABC. However, SVI is highly sensitive to the variance of the gradient estimators, and this problem is exacerbated by approximating the likelihood. We draw upon recent advances in variance reduction for SV and likelihood-free inference using deterministic simulations to produce low variance gradient estimators of the variational lower-bound. By then exploiting automatic differentiation libraries we can avoid nearly all model-specific derivations. We demonstrate performance on three problems and compare to existing SVI algorithms. Our results demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of our algorithm.	Automatic Variational ABC
0911.0491v1	Online learning algorithms have impressive convergence properties when it comes to risk minimization and convex games on very large problems. However, they are inherently sequential in their design which prevents them from taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures. In this paper we prove that online learning with delayed updates converges well, thereby facilitating parallel online learning.	Slow Learners are Fast
1202.1523v1	"We describe Information Forests, an approach to classification that generalizes Random Forests by replacing the splitting criterion of non-leaf nodes from a discriminative one -- based on the entropy of the label distribution -- to a generative one -- based on maximizing the information divergence between the class-conditional distributions in the resulting partitions. The basic idea consists of deferring classification until a measure of ""classification confidence"" is sufficiently high, and instead breaking down the data so as to maximize this measure. In an alternative interpretation, Information Forests attempt to partition the data into subsets that are ""as informative as possible"" for the purpose of the task, which is to classify the data. Classification confidence, or informative content of the subsets, is quantified by the Information Divergence. Our approach relates to active learning, semi-supervised learning, mixed generative/discriminative learning."	Information Forests
1603.07738v1	Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games are among the most played digital games in the world. In these games, teams of players fight against each other in arena environments, and the gameplay is focused on tactical combat. Mastering MOBAs requires extensive practice, as is exemplified in the popular MOBA Defence of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2). In this paper, we present three data-driven measures of spatio-temporal behavior in DotA 2: 1) Zone changes; 2) Distribution of team members and: 3) Time series clustering via a fuzzy approach. We present a method for obtaining accurate positional data from DotA 2. We investigate how behavior varies across these measures as a function of the skill level of teams, using four tiers from novice to professional players. Results indicate that spatio-temporal behavior of MOBA teams is related to team skill, with professional teams having smaller within-team distances and conducting more zone changes than amateur teams. The temporal distribution of the within-team distances of professional and high-skilled teams also generally follows patterns distinct from lower skill ranks.

1506.00308v1	Models of complex systems are often formalized as sequential software simulators: computationally intensive programs that iteratively build up probable system configurations given parameters and initial conditions. These simulators enable modelers to capture effects that are difficult to characterize analytically or summarize statistically. However, in many real-world applications, these simulations need to be inverted to match the observed data. This typically requires the custom design, derivation and implementation of sophisticated inversion algorithms. Here we give a framework for inverting a broad class of complex software simulators via probabilistic programming and automatic inference, using under 20 lines of probabilistic code. Our approach is based on a formulation of inversion as approximate inference in a simple sequential probabilistic model. We implement four inference strategies, including Metropolis-Hastings, a sequentialized Metropolis-Hastings scheme, and a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, requiring 4 or fewer lines of probabilistic code each. We demonstrate our framework by applying it to invert a real geological software simulator from the oil and gas industry.

1001.0175v2	Many probabilistic models introduce strong dependencies between variables using a latent multivariate Gaussian distribution or a Gaussian process. We present a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for performing inference in models with multivariate Gaussian priors. Its key properties are: 1) it has simple, generic code applicable to many models, 2) it has no free parameters, 3) it works well for a variety of Gaussian process based models. These properties make our method ideal for use while model building, removing the need to spend time deriving and tuning updates for more complex algorithms.	Elliptical slice sampling
1407.0581v10	We study the problem of learning sparse structure changes between two Markov networks $P$ and $Q$. Rather than fitting two Markov networks separately to two sets of data and figuring out their differences, a recent work proposed to learn changes \emph{directly} via estimating the ratio between two Markov network models. In this paper, we give sufficient conditions for \emph{successful change detection} with respect to the sample size $n_p, n_q$, the dimension of data $m$, and the number of changed edges $d$. When using an unbounded density ratio model we prove that the true sparse changes can be consistently identified for $n_p = \Omega(d^2 \log \frac{m^2+m}{2})$ and $n_q = \Omega({n_p^2})$, with an exponentially decaying upper-bound on learning error. Such sample complexity can be improved to $\min(n_p, n_q) = \Omega(d^2 \log \frac{m^2+m}{2})$ when the boundedness of the density ratio model is assumed. Our theoretical guarantee can be applied to a wide range of discrete/continuous Markov networks.	Support Consistency of Direct Sparse-Change Learning in Markov Networks

The current released version of GPflowOpt includes some standard single-objective acquisition functions, the state-of-the-art max-value entropy search, as well as a Bayesian multi-objective approach. Finally, it permits easy use of custom modeling strategies implemented in GPflow.	GPflowOpt: A Bayesian Optimization Library using TensorFlow
1505.00869v1	In modern scientific research, massive datasets with huge numbers of observations are frequently encountered. To facilitate the computational process, a divide-and-conquer scheme is often used for the analysis of big data. In such a strategy, a full dataset is first split into several manageable segments; the final output is then averaged from the individual outputs of the segments. Despite its popularity in practice, it remains largely unknown that whether such a distributive strategy provides valid theoretical inferences to the original data. In this paper, we address this fundamental issue for the distributed kernel regression (DKR), where the algorithmic feasibility is measured by the generalization performance of the resulting estimator. To justify DKR, a uniform convergence rate is needed for bounding the generalization error over the individual outputs, which brings new and challenging issues in the big data setup. Under mild conditions, we show that, with a proper number of segments, DKR leads to an estimator that is generalization consistent to the unknown regression function. The obtained results justify the method of DKR and shed light on the feasibility of using other distributed algorithms for processing big data. The promising preference of the method is supported by both simulation and real data examples.	On the Feasibility of Distributed Kernel Regression for Big Data
1602.00260v2	Generating user interpretable multi-class predictions in data rich environments with many classes and explanatory covariates is a daunting task. We introduce Diagonal Orthant Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DOLDA), a supervised topic model for multi-class classification that can handle both many classes as well as many covariates. To handle many classes we use the recently proposed Diagonal Orthant (DO) probit model (Johndrow et al., 2013) together with an efficient Horseshoe prior for variable selection/shrinkage (Carvalho et al., 2010). We propose a computationally efficient parallel Gibbs sampler for the new model. An important advantage of DOLDA is that learned topics are directly connected to individual classes without the need for a reference class. We evaluate the model's predictive accuracy on two datasets and demonstrate DOLDA's advantage in interpreting the generated predictions.

1702.05777v5	"Background: Statistical mechanics results (Dauphin et al. (2014); Choromanska et al. (2015)) suggest that local minima with high error are exponentially rare in high dimensions. However, to prove low error guarantees for Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs), previous works so far required either a heavily modified MNN model or training method, strong assumptions on the labels (e.g., ""near"" linear separability), or an unrealistic hidden layer with $\Omega\left(N\right)$ units. Results: We examine a MNN with one hidden layer of piecewise linear units, a single output, and a quadratic loss. We prove that, with high probability in the limit of $N\rightarrow\infty$ datapoints, the volume of differentiable regions of the empiric loss containing sub-optimal differentiable local minima is exponentially vanishing in comparison with the same volume of global minima, given standard normal input of dimension $d_{0}=\tilde{\Omega}\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$, and a more realistic number of $d_{1}=\tilde{\Omega}\left(N/d_{0}\right)$ hidden units. We demonstrate our results numerically: for example, $0\%$ binary classification training error on CIFAR with only $N/d_{0}\approx 16$ hidden neurons."

1506.03431v2	Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference. Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult to automate. We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI). The user only provides a Bayesian model and a dataset; nothing else. We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We implement ADVI in Stan (code available now), a probabilistic programming framework. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images. With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan.	Automatic Variational Inference in Stan
1507.05131v4	The density matrices are positively semi-definite Hermitian matrices of unit trace that describe the state of a quantum system. The goal of the paper is to develop minimax lower bounds on error rates of estimation of low rank density matrices in trace regression models used in quantum state tomography (in particular, in the case of Pauli measurements) with explicit dependence of the bounds on the rank and other complexity parameters. Such bounds are established for several statistically relevant distances, including quantum versions of Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy distance) and of Hellinger distance (so called Bures distance), and Schatten $p$-norm distances. Sharp upper bounds and oracle inequalities for least squares estimator with von Neumann entropy penalization are obtained showing that minimax lower bounds are attained (up to logarithmic factors) for these distances.

1710.05578v1	New social and economic activities massively exploit big data and machine learning algorithms to do inference on people's lives. Applications include automatic curricula evaluation, wage determination, and risk assessment for credits and loans. Recently, many governments and institutions have raised concerns about the lack of fairness, equity and ethics in machine learning to treat these problems. It has been shown that not including sensitive features that bias fairness, such as gender or race, is not enough to mitigate the discrimination when other related features are included. Instead, including fairness in the objective function has been shown to be more efficient. We present novel fair regression and dimensionality reduction methods built on a previously proposed fair classification framework. Both methods rely on using the Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion as the fairness term. Unlike previous approaches, this allows us to simplify the problem and to use multiple sensitive variables simultaneously. Replacing the linear formulation by kernel functions allows the methods to deal with nonlinear problems. For both linear and nonlinear formulations the solution reduces to solving simple matrix inversions or generalized eigenvalue problems. This simplifies the evaluation of the solutions for different trade-off values between the predictive error and fairness terms. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methods in toy examples, and evaluate their performance on real world datasets to predict income using gender and/or race discrimination as sensitive variables, and contraceptive method prediction under demographic and socio-economic sensitive descriptors.

1711.07561v1	This is a technical report which explores the estimation methodologies on hyper-parameters in Markov Random Field and Gaussian Hidden Markov Random Field. In first section, we briefly investigate a theoretical framework on Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Next, by using MH algorithm, we simulate the data from Ising model, and study on how hyper-parameter estimation in Ising model is enabled through MCMC algorithm using pseudo-likelihood approximation. Following section deals with an issue on parameters estimation process of Gaussian Hidden Markov Random Field using MAP estimation and EM algorithm, and also discusses problems, found through several experiments. In following section, we expand this idea on estimating parameters in Gaussian Hidden Markov Spatial-Temporal Random Field, and display results on two performed experiments.

1801.09667v1	In the stochastic bandit problem, the goal is to maximize an unknown function via a sequence of noisy function evaluations. Typically, the observation noise is assumed to be independent of the evaluation point and satisfies a tail bound taken uniformly on the domain. In this work, we consider the setting of heteroscedastic noise, that is, we explicitly allow the noise distribution to depend on the evaluation point. We show that this leads to new trade-offs for information and regret, which are not taken into account by existing approaches like upper confidence bound algorithms (UCB) or Thompson Sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a frequentist regret framework, that is similar to the Bayesian analysis of Russo and Van Roy (2014). We prove a new high-probability regret bound for general, possibly randomized policies, depending on a quantity we call the regret-information ratio. From this bound, we define a frequentist version of Information Directed Sampling (IDS) to minimize a surrogate of the regret-information ratio over all possible action sampling distributions. In order to construct the surrogate function, we generalize known concentration inequalities for least squares regression in separable Hilbert spaces to the case of heteroscedastic noise. This allows us to formulate several variants of IDS for linear and reproducing kernel Hilbert space response functions, yielding a family of novel algorithms for Bayesian optimization. We also provide frequentist regret bounds, which in the homoscedastic case are comparable to existing bounds for UCB, but can be much better when the noise is heteroscedastic. Finally, we empirically demonstrate in a linear setting, that some of our methods can outperform UCB and Thompson Sampling, even when the noise is homoscedastic.

1102.3949v2	We address the sparse signal recovery problem in the context of multiple measurement vectors (MMV) when elements in each nonzero row of the solution matrix are temporally correlated. Existing algorithms do not consider such temporal correlations and thus their performance degrades significantly with the correlations. In this work, we propose a block sparse Bayesian learning framework which models the temporal correlations. In this framework we derive two sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithms, which have superior recovery performance compared to existing algorithms, especially in the presence of high temporal correlations. Furthermore, our algorithms are better at handling highly underdetermined problems and require less row-sparsity on the solution matrix. We also provide analysis of the global and local minima of their cost function, and show that the SBL cost function has the very desirable property that the global minimum is at the sparsest solution to the MMV problem. Extensive experiments also provide some interesting results that motivate future theoretical research on the MMV model.

1407.7502v3	Data analysis and machine learning have become an integrative part of the modern scientific methodology, offering automated procedures for the prediction of a phenomenon based on past observations, unraveling underlying patterns in data and providing insights about the problem. Yet, caution should avoid using machine learning as a black-box tool, but rather consider it as a methodology, with a rational thought process that is entirely dependent on the problem under study. In particular, the use of algorithms should ideally require a reasonable understanding of their mechanisms, properties and limitations, in order to better apprehend and interpret their results. Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to provide an in-depth analysis of random forests, consistently calling into question each and every part of the algorithm, in order to shed new light on its learning capabilities, inner workings and interpretability. The first part of this work studies the induction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized trees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible. Our contributions follow with an original complexity analysis of random forests, showing their good computational performance and scalability, along with an in-depth discussion of their implementation details, as contributed within Scikit-Learn. In the second part of this work, we analyse and discuss the interpretability of random forests in the eyes of variable importance measures. The core of our contributions rests in the theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease of Impurity variable importance measure, from which we prove and derive some of its properties in the case of multiway totally randomized trees and in asymptotic conditions. In consequence of this work, our analysis demonstrates that variable importances [...].	Understanding Random Forests: From Theory to Practice
0809.3803v1	Background: Many authors have described MELD as a predictor of short-term mortality in the liver transplantation waiting list. However MELD score accuracy to predict long term mortality has not been statistically evaluated. Objective: The aim of this study is to analyze the MELD score as well as other variables as a predictor of long-term mortality using a new model: the Survival Tree analysis. Study Design and Setting: The variables obtained at the time of liver transplantation list enrollment and considered in this study are: sex, age, blood type, body mass index, etiology of liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, waiting time for transplant and MELD. Mortality on the waiting list is the outcome. Exclusion, transplantation or still in the transplantation list at the end of the study are censored data. Results: The graphical representation of the survival trees showed that the most statistically significant cut off is related to MELD score at point 16. Conclusion: The results are compatible with the cut off point of MELD indicated in the clinical literature.	Survival tree and meld to predict long term survival in liver  transplantation waiting list
1709.00379v2	Sparse alpha-norm regularization has many data-rich applications in Marketing and Economics. Alpha-norm, in contrast to lasso and ridge regularization, jumps to a sparse solution. This feature is attractive for ultra high-dimensional problems that occur in demand estimation and forecasting. The alpha-norm objective is nonconvex and requires coordinate descent and proximal operators to find the sparse solution. We study a typical marketing demand forecasting problem, grocery store sales for salty snacks, that has many dummy variables as controls. The key predictors of demand include price, equivalized volume, promotion, flavor, scent, and brand effects. By comparing with many commonly used machine learning methods, alpha-norm regularization achieves its goal of providing accurate out-of-sample estimates for the promotion lift effects. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.	Sparse Regularization in Marketing and Economics
1605.03040v1	A very simple interpretation of matrix completion problem is introduced based on statistical models. Combined with the well-known results from missing data analysis, such interpretation indicates that matrix completion is still a valid and principled estimation procedure even without the missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption, which almost all of the current theoretical studies of matrix completion assume.

1802.06967v1	We study the problem of recovery of matrices that are simultaneously low rank and row and/or column sparse. Such matrices appear in recent applications in cognitive neuroscience, imaging, computer vision, macroeconomics, and genetics. We propose a GDT (Gradient Descent with hard Thresholding) algorithm to efficiently recover matrices with such structure, by minimizing a bi-convex function over a nonconvex set of constraints. We show linear convergence of the iterates obtained by GDT to a region within statistical error of an optimal solution. As an application of our method, we consider multi-task learning problems and show that the statistical error rate obtained by GDT is near optimal compared to minimax rate. Experiments demonstrate competitive performance and much faster running speed compared to existing methods, on both simulations and real data sets.

1411.6311v1	This article considers the problem of multi-group classification in the setting where the number of variables $p$ is larger than the number of observations $n$. Several methods have been proposed in the literature that address this problem, however their variable selection performance is either unknown or suboptimal to the results known in the two-group case. In this work we provide sharp conditions for the consistent recovery of relevant variables in the multi-group case using the discriminant analysis proposal of Gaynanova et al., 2014. We achieve the rates of convergence that attain the optimal scaling of the sample size $n$, number of variables $p$ and the sparsity level $s$. These rates are significantly faster than the best known results in the multi-group case. Moreover, they coincide with the optimal minimax rates for the two-group case. We validate our theoretical results with numerical analysis.	Optimal variable selection in multi-group sparse discriminant analysis
1406.3175v2	Subsampling methods have been recently proposed to speed up least squares estimation in large scale settings. However, these algorithms are typically not robust to outliers or corruptions in the observed covariates. The concept of influence that was developed for regression diagnostics can be used to detect such corrupted observations as shown in this paper. This property of influence -- for which we also develop a randomized approximation -- motivates our proposed subsampling algorithm for large scale corrupted linear regression which limits the influence of data points since highly influential points contribute most to the residual error. Under a general model of corrupted observations, we show theoretically and empirically on a variety of simulated and real datasets that our algorithm improves over the current state-of-the-art approximation schemes for ordinary least squares.

1304.7981v5	For multiple multivariate data sets, we derive conditions under which Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA) improves classification performance of the projected datasets, compared to standard Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) using only two data sets. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations and a real data experiment.	Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis for Classification
1202.3748v1	Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) are rich probabilistic models that have recently been applied to a wide range of problems, including collaborative filtering, classification, and modeling motion capture data. While much progress has been made in training non-conditional RBMs, these algorithms are not applicable to conditional models and there has been almost no work on training and generating predictions from conditional RBMs for structured output problems. We first argue that standard Contrastive Divergence-based learning may not be suitable for training CRBMs. We then identify two distinct types of structured output prediction problems and propose an improved learning algorithm for each. The first problem type is one where the output space has arbitrary structure but the set of likely output configurations is relatively small, such as in multi-label classification. The second problem is one where the output space is arbitrarily structured but where the output space variability is much greater, such as in image denoising or pixel labeling. We show that the new learning algorithms can work much better than Contrastive Divergence on both types of problems.	Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Structured Output  Prediction
1711.05363v1	A nonparametric family of conditional distributions is introduced, which generalizes conditional exponential families using functional parameters in a suitable RKHS. An algorithm is provided for learning the generalized natural parameter, and consistency of the estimator is established in the well specified case. In experiments, the new method generally outperforms a competing approach with consistency guarantees, and is competitive with a deep conditional density model on datasets that exhibit abrupt transitions and heteroscedasticity.

1707.09548v1	In this paper, a generalized multivariate Student-t mixture model is developed for classification and clustering of Low Probability of Intercept radar waveforms. A Low Probability of Intercept radar signal is characterized by a pulse compression waveform which is either frequency-modulated or phase-modulated. The proposed model can classify and cluster different modulation types such as linear frequency modulation, non linear frequency modulation, polyphase Barker, polyphase P1, P2, P3, P4, Frank and Zadoff codes. The classification method focuses on the introduction of a new prior distribution for the model hyper-parameters that gives us the possibility to handle sensitivity of mixture models to initialization and to allow a less restrictive modeling of data. Inference is processed through a Variational Bayes method and a Bayesian treatment is adopted for model learning, supervised classification and clustering. Moreover, the novel prior distribution is not a well-known probability distribution and both deterministic and stochastic methods are employed to estimate its expectations. Some numerical experiments show that the proposed method is less sensitive to initialization and provides more accurate results than the previous state of the art mixture models.

1404.0752v1	Bayesian networks are convenient graphical expressions for high dimensional probability distributions representing complex relationships between a large number of random variables. They have been employed extensively in areas such as bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, diagnosis, and risk management. The recovery of the structure of a network from data is of prime importance for the purposes of modeling, analysis, and prediction. Most recovery algorithms in the literature assume either discrete of continuous but Gaussian data. For general continuous data, discretization is usually employed but often destroys the very structure one is out to recover. Friedman and Goldszmidt suggest an approach based on the minimum description length principle that chooses a discretization which preserves the information in the original data set, however it is one which is difficult, if not impossible, to implement for even moderately sized networks. In this paper we provide an extremely efficient search strategy which allows one to use the Friedman and Goldszmidt discretization in practice.

1106.0762v1	"This paper addresses the problem of inferring sparse causal networks modeled by multivariate auto-regressive (MAR) processes. Conditions are derived under which the Group Lasso (gLasso) procedure consistently estimates sparse network structure. The key condition involves a ""false connection score."" In particular, we show that consistent recovery is possible even when the number of observations of the network is far less than the number of parameters describing the network, provided that the false connection score is less than one. The false connection score is also demonstrated to be a useful metric of recovery in non-asymptotic regimes. The conditions suggest a modified gLasso procedure which tends to improve the false connection score and reduce the chances of reversing the direction of causal influence. Computational experiments and a real network based electrocorticogram (ECoG) simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."	Causal Network Inference via Group Sparse Regularization
1606.05672v1	Improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of brain decoding models. As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, we present a simple definition for interpretability of linear brain decoding models. Then, we propose to combine the interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our preliminary results on the toy data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative linear models. The presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability in linear brain decoding.	Interpretability in Linear Brain Decoding
1205.1782v2	Approximate dynamic programming is a popular method for solving large Markov decision processes. This paper describes a new class of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods- distributionally robust ADP-that address the curse of dimensionality by minimizing a pessimistic bound on the policy loss. This approach turns ADP into an optimization problem, for which we derive new mathematical program formulations and analyze its properties. DRADP improves on the theoretical guarantees of existing ADP methods-it guarantees convergence and L1 norm based error bounds. The empirical evaluation of DRADP shows that the theoretical guarantees translate well into good performance on benchmark problems.

1202.1787v1	We propose a new yet natural algorithm for learning the graph structure of general discrete graphical models (a.k.a. Markov random fields) from samples. Our algorithm finds the neighborhood of a node by sequentially adding nodes that produce the largest reduction in empirical conditional entropy; it is greedy in the sense that the choice of addition is based only on the reduction achieved at that iteration. Its sequential nature gives it a lower computational complexity as compared to other existing comparison-based techniques, all of which involve exhaustive searches over every node set of a certain size. Our main result characterizes the sample complexity of this procedure, as a function of node degrees, graph size and girth in factor-graph representation. We subsequently specialize this result to the case of Ising models, where we provide a simple transparent characterization of sample complexity as a function of model and graph parameters. For tree graphs, our algorithm is the same as the classical Chow-Liu algorithm, and in that sense can be considered the extension of the same to graphs with cycles.	Greedy Learning of Markov Network Structure
1712.03281v1	In this paper, we study the general problem of optimizing a convex function $F(L)$ over the set of $p \times p$ matrices, subject to rank constraints on $L$. However, existing first-order methods for solving such problems either are too slow to converge, or require multiple invocations of singular value decompositions. On the other hand, factorization-based non-convex algorithms, while being much faster, require stringent assumptions on the \emph{condition number} of the optimum. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithmic framework that achieves the best of both worlds: asymptotically as fast as factorization methods, while requiring no dependency on the condition number. We instantiate our general framework for three important matrix estimation problems that impact several practical applications; (i) a \emph{nonlinear} variant of affine rank minimization, (ii) logistic PCA, and (iii) precision matrix estimation in probabilistic graphical model learning. We then derive explicit bounds on the sample complexity as well as the running time of our approach, and show that it achieves the best possible bounds for both cases. We also provide an extensive range of experimental results, and demonstrate that our algorithm provides a very attractive tradeoff between estimation accuracy and running time.

1705.07079v1	Gradient matching is a promising tool for learning parameters and state dynamics of ordinary differential equations. It is a grid free inference approach which for fully observable systems is at times competitive with numerical integration. However for many real-world applications, only sparse observations are available or even unobserved variables are included in the model description. In these cases most gradient matching methods are difficult to apply or simply do not provide satisfactory results. That is why despite the high computational cost numerical integration is still the gold standard in many applications. Using an existing gradient matching approach, we propose a scalable variational inference framework, which can infer states and parameters simultaneously, offers computational speedups, improved accuracy and works well even under model misspecifications in a partially observable system.

1108.3829v2	We consider the sparse inverse covariance regularization problem or graphical lasso with regularization parameter $\rho$. Suppose the co- variance graph formed by thresholding the entries of the sample covariance matrix at $\rho$ is decomposed into connected components. We show that the vertex-partition induced by the thresholded covariance graph is exactly equal to that induced by the estimated concentration graph. This simple rule, when used as a wrapper around existing algorithms, leads to enormous performance gains. For large values of $\rho$, our proposal splits a large graphical lasso problem into smaller tractable problems, making it possible to solve an otherwise infeasible large scale graphical lasso problem.

1501.07768v1	AB-testing is a very popular technique in web companies since it makes it possible to accurately predict the impact of a modification with the simplicity of a random split across users. One of the critical aspects of an AB-test is its duration and it is important to reliably compute confidence intervals associated with the metric of interest to know when to stop the test. In this paper, we define a clean mathematical framework to model the AB-test process. We then propose three algorithms based on bootstrapping and on the central limit theorem to compute reliable confidence intervals which extend to other metrics than the common probabilities of success. They apply to both absolute and relative increments of the most used comparison metrics, including the number of occurrences of a particular event and a click-through rate implying a ratio.

1502.05336v2	Large multilayer neural networks trained with backpropagation have recently achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of problems. However, using backprop for neural net learning still has some disadvantages, e.g., having to tune a large number of hyperparameters to the data, lack of calibrated probabilistic predictions, and a tendency to overfit the training data. In principle, the Bayesian approach to learning neural networks does not have these problems. However, existing Bayesian techniques lack scalability to large dataset and network sizes. In this work we present a novel scalable method for learning Bayesian neural networks, called probabilistic backpropagation (PBP). Similar to classical backpropagation, PBP works by computing a forward propagation of probabilities through the network and then doing a backward computation of gradients. A series of experiments on ten real-world datasets show that PBP is significantly faster than other techniques, while offering competitive predictive abilities. Our experiments also show that PBP provides accurate estimates of the posterior variance on the network weights.	Probabilistic Backpropagation for Scalable Learning of Bayesian Neural  Networks
1107.2699v1	Purely data driven approaches for machine learning present difficulties when data is scarce relative to the complexity of the model or when the model is forced to extrapolate. On the other hand, purely mechanistic approaches need to identify and specify all the interactions in the problem at hand (which may not be feasible) and still leave the issue of how to parameterize the system. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes and differential equations to combine data driven modelling with a physical model of the system. We show how different, physically-inspired, kernel functions can be developed through sensible, simple, mechanistic assumptions about the underlying system. The versatility of our approach is illustrated with three case studies from motion capture, computational biology and geostatistics.	Linear Latent Force Models using Gaussian Processes
1202.3730v1	Latent force models (LFMs) are hybrid models combining mechanistic principles with non-parametric components. In this article, we shall show how LFMs can be equivalently formulated and solved using the state variable approach. We shall also show how the Gaussian process prior used in LFMs can be equivalently formulated as a linear statespace model driven by a white noise process and how inference on the resulting model can be efficiently implemented using Kalman filter and smoother. Then we shall show how the recently proposed switching LFM can be reformulated using the state variable approach, and how we can construct a probabilistic model for the switches by formulating a similar switching LFM as a switching linear dynamic system (SLDS). We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology in simulated scenarios and apply it to inferring the switching points in GPS data collected from car movement data in urban environment.

1706.00514v2	We study the problem of detecting change points (CPs) that are characterized by a subset of dimensions in a multi-dimensional sequence. A method for detecting those CPs can be formulated as a two-stage method: one for selecting relevant dimensions, and another for selecting CPs. It has been difficult to properly control the false detection probability of these CP detection methods because selection bias in each stage must be properly corrected. Our main contribution in this paper is to formulate a CP detection problem as a selective inference problem, and show that exact (non-asymptotic) inference is possible for a class of CP detection methods. We demonstrate the performances of the proposed selective inference framework through numerical simulations and its application to our motivating medical data analysis problem.

1205.1406v2	We study the problem of prediction for evolving graph data. We formulate the problem as the minimization of a convex objective encouraging sparsity and low-rank of the solution, that reflect natural graph properties. The convex formulation allows to obtain oracle inequalities and efficient solvers. We provide empirical results for our algorithm and comparison with competing methods, and point out two open questions related to compressed sensing and algebra of low-rank and sparse matrices.

1202.3775v1	Conditional independence testing is an important problem, especially in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Due to the curse of dimensionality, testing for conditional independence of continuous variables is particularly challenging. We propose a Kernel-based Conditional Independence test (KCI-test), by constructing an appropriate test statistic and deriving its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence. The proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement. Experimental results show that it outperforms other methods, especially when the conditioning set is large or the sample size is not very large, in which case other methods encounter difficulties.

0810.5655v1	"In the popular approach of ""Bayesian variable selection"" (BVS), one uses prior and posterior distributions to select a subset of candidate variables to enter the model. A completely new direction will be considered here to study BVS with a Gibbs posterior originating in statistical mechanics. The Gibbs posterior is constructed from a risk function of practical interest (such as the classification error) and aims at minimizing a risk function without modeling the data probabilistically. This can improve the performance over the usual Bayesian approach, which depends on a probability model which may be misspecified. Conditions will be provided to achieve good risk performance, even in the presence of high dimensionality, when the number of candidate variables ""$K$"" can be much larger than the sample size ""$n$."" In addition, we develop a convenient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to implement BVS with the Gibbs posterior."

1706.03662v2	We present an efficient block-diagonal ap- proximation to the Gauss-Newton matrix for feedforward neural networks. Our result- ing algorithm is competitive against state- of-the-art first order optimisation methods, with sometimes significant improvement in optimisation performance. Unlike first-order methods, for which hyperparameter tuning of the optimisation parameters is often a labo- rious process, our approach can provide good performance even when used with default set- tings. A side result of our work is that for piecewise linear transfer functions, the net- work objective function can have no differ- entiable local maxima, which may partially explain why such transfer functions facilitate effective optimisation.

1605.07254v2	Kernel-based quadrature rules are becoming important in machine learning and statistics, as they achieve super-$\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates in numerical integration, and thus provide alternatives to Monte Carlo integration in challenging settings where integrands are expensive to evaluate or where integrands are high dimensional. These rules are based on the assumption that the integrand has a certain degree of smoothness, which is expressed as that the integrand belongs to a certain reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, this assumption can be violated in practice (e.g., when the integrand is a black box function), and no general theory has been established for the convergence of kernel quadratures in such misspecified settings. Our contribution is in proving that kernel quadratures can be consistent even when the integrand does not belong to the assumed RKHS, i.e., when the integrand is less smooth than assumed. Specifically, we derive convergence rates that depend on the (unknown) lesser smoothness of the integrand, where the degree of smoothness is expressed via powers of RKHSs or via Sobolev spaces.

It gives a comprehensive overview of the most commonly de-tected phenotypes and its underlying data sets. Special attention is given to preprocessing of in-put data and the different modeling approaches. The literature review confirms natural language processing to be a promising approach for electronic phenotyping. However, accessibility and lack of natural language process standards for medical texts remain a challenge. Future research should develop such standards and further investigate which machine learning approaches are best suited to which type of medical data.

0901.1504v2	In this paper, we consider the sparse eigenvalue problem wherein the goal is to obtain a sparse solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem. We achieve this by constraining the cardinality of the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem and obtain sparse principal component analysis (PCA), sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and sparse Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) as special cases. Unlike the $\ell_1$-norm approximation to the cardinality constraint, which previous methods have used in the context of sparse PCA, we propose a tighter approximation that is related to the negative log-likelihood of a Student's t-distribution. The problem is then framed as a d.c. (difference of convex functions) program and is solved as a sequence of convex programs by invoking the majorization-minimization method. The resulting algorithm is proved to exhibit \emph{global convergence} behavior, i.e., for any random initialization, the sequence (subsequence) of iterates generated by the algorithm converges to a stationary point of the d.c. program. The performance of the algorithm is empirically demonstrated on both sparse PCA (finding few relevant genes that explain as much variance as possible in a high-dimensional gene dataset) and sparse CCA (cross-language document retrieval and vocabulary selection for music retrieval) applications.

1506.03958v1	Over the past years Robust PCA has been established as a standard tool for reliable low-rank approximation of matrices in the presence of outliers. Recently, the Robust PCA approach via nuclear norm minimization has been extended to matrices with linear structures which appear in applications such as system identification and data series analysis. At the same time it has been shown how to control the rank of a structured approximation via matrix factorization approaches. The drawbacks of these methods either lie in the lack of robustness against outliers or in their static nature of repeated batch-processing. We present a Robust Structured Low-Rank Approximation method on the Grassmannian that on the one hand allows for fast re-initialization in an online setting due to subspace identification with manifolds, and that is robust against outliers due to a smooth approximation of the $\ell_p$-norm cost function on the other hand. The method is evaluated in online time series forecasting tasks on simulated and real-world data.	Robust Structured Low-Rank Approximation on the Grassmannian
1802.07535v1	We present a novel model architecture which leverages deep learning tools to perform exact Bayesian inference on sets of high dimensional, complex observations. Our model is provably exchangeable, meaning that the joint distribution over observations is invariant under permutation: this property lies at the heart of Bayesian inference. The model does not require variational approximations to train, and new samples can be generated conditional on previous samples, with cost linear in the size of the conditioning set. The advantages of our architecture are demonstrated on learning tasks requiring generalisation from short observed sequences while modelling sequence variability, such as conditional image generation, few-shot learning, set completion, and anomaly detection.

1607.05506v2	Concentration inequalities are indispensable tools for studying the generalization capacity of learning models. Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities are commonly used, giving bounds independent of the data distribution. Although this makes them widely applicable, a drawback is that the bounds can be too loose in some specific cases. Although efforts have been devoted to improving the bounds, we find that the bounds can be further tightened in some distribution-dependent scenarios and conditions for the inequalities can be relaxed. In particular, we propose four types of conditions for probabilistic boundedness and bounded differences, and derive several distribution-dependent extensions of Hoeffding's and McDiarmid's inequalities. These extensions provide bounds for functions not satisfying the conditions of the existing inequalities, and in some special cases, tighter bounds. Furthermore, we obtain generalization bounds for unbounded and hierarchy-bounded loss functions. Finally we discuss the potential applications of our extensions to learning theory.	Distribution-dependent concentration inequalities for tighter  generalization bounds
0705.2363v1	We consider the problem of binary classification where one can, for a particular cost, choose not to classify an observation. We present a simple proof for the oracle inequality for the excess risk of structural risk minimizers using a lasso type penalty.	Lasso type classifiers with a reject option
1211.1275v3	We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a fully Bayesian treatment and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as different kernels. Kernel functions have been introduced to matrix factorization to integrate side information about the rows and columns (e.g., objects and users in recommender systems), which is necessary for making out-of-matrix (i.e., cold start) predictions. We discuss specifically bipartite graph inference, where the output matrix is binary, but extensions to more general matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A fully conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization problem enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas fully Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning that additionally reveals which side information sources are informative. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. We then show that our framework can also be used for solving multilabel learning problems by considering samples and labels as the two domains where matrix factorization operates on. Our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming loss values on 10 out of 14 multilabel classification data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms.	Kernelized Bayesian Matrix Factorization
1702.07405v1	We consider the problem of estimating a regression function in the common situation where the number of features is small, where interpretability of the model is a high priority, and where simple linear or additive models fail to provide adequate performance. To address this problem, we present GapTV, an approach that is conceptually related both to CART and to the more recent CRISP algorithm, a state-of-the-art alternative method for interpretable nonlinear regression. GapTV divides the feature space into blocks of constant value and fits the value of all blocks jointly via a convex optimization routine. Our method is fully data-adaptive, in that it incorporates highly robust routines for tuning all hyperparameters automatically. We compare our approach against CART and CRISP and demonstrate that GapTV finds a much better trade-off between accuracy and interpretability.	GapTV: Accurate and Interpretable Low-Dimensional Regression and  Classification
0908.1258v1	We propose a family of statistical models for social network evolution over time, which represents an extension of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). Many of the methods for ERGMs are readily adapted for these models, including maximum likelihood estimation algorithms. We discuss models of this type and their properties, and give examples, as well as a demonstration of their use for hypothesis testing and classification. We believe our temporal ERG models represent a useful new framework for modeling time-evolving social networks, and rewiring networks from other domains such as gene regulation circuitry, and communication networks.	Discrete Temporal Models of Social Networks
1203.6345v2	We introduce a new discriminant analysis method (Empirical Discriminant Analysis or EDA) for binary classification in machine learning. Given a dataset of feature vectors, this method defines an empirical feature map transforming the training and test data into new data with components having Gaussian empirical distributions. This map is an empirical version of the Gaussian copula used in probability and mathematical finance. The purpose is to form a feature mapped dataset as close as possible to Gaussian, after which standard quadratic discriminants can be used for classification. We discuss this method in general, and apply it to some datasets in computational biology.	Empirical Normalization for Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and  Classifying Cancer Subtypes
1610.06235v1	Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful method for blind source separation based on the assumption that sources are statistically independent. Though ICA has proven useful and has been employed in many applications, complete statistical independence can be too restrictive an assumption in practice. Additionally, important prior information about the data, such as sparsity, is usually available. Sparsity is a natural property of the data, a form of diversity, which, if incorporated into the ICA model, can relax the independence assumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance. In this work, we propose a new variant of ICA by entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM)-a flexible, yet parameter-free algorithm-through the direct exploitation of sparsity. Using this new SparseICA-EBM algorithm, we study the synergy of independence and sparsity through simulations on synthetic as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-like data.	Enhancing ICA Performance by Exploiting Sparsity: Application to FMRI  Analysis
1204.5540v3	We consider the structure learning problem for graphical models that we call loosely connected Markov random fields, in which the number of short paths between any pair of nodes is small, and present a new conditional independence test based algorithm for learning the underlying graph structure. The novel maximization step in our algorithm ensures that the true edges are detected correctly even when there are short cycles in the graph. The number of samples required by our algorithm is C*log p, where p is the size of the graph and the constant C depends on the parameters of the model. We show that several previously studied models are examples of loosely connected Markov random fields, and our algorithm achieves the same or lower computational complexity than the previously designed algorithms for individual cases. We also get new results for more general graphical models, in particular, our algorithm learns general Ising models on the Erdos-Renyi random graph G(p, c/p) correctly with running time O(np^5).	Learning Loosely Connected Markov Random Fields
1505.01627v1	We address the problem of synthetic gene design using Bayesian optimization. The main issue when designing a gene is that the design space is defined in terms of long strings of characters of different lengths, which renders the optimization intractable. We propose a three-step approach to deal with this issue. First, we use a Gaussian process model to emulate the behavior of the cell. As inputs of the model, we use a set of biologically meaningful gene features, which allows us to define optimal gene designs rules. Based on the model outputs we define a multi-task acquisition function to optimize simultaneously severals aspects of interest. Finally, we define an evaluation function, which allow us to rank sets of candidate gene sequences that are coherent with the optimal design strategy. We illustrate the performance of this approach in a real gene design experiment with mammalian cells.	Bayesian Optimization for Synthetic Gene Design
0706.3499v1	The distance metric plays an important role in nearest neighbor (NN) classification. Usually the Euclidean distance metric is assumed or a Mahalanobis distance metric is optimized to improve the NN performance. In this paper, we study the problem of embedding arbitrary metric spaces into a Euclidean space with the goal to improve the accuracy of the NN classifier. We propose a solution by appealing to the framework of regularization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and prove a representer-like theorem for NN classification. The embedding function is then determined by solving a semidefinite program which has an interesting connection to the soft-margin linear binary support vector machine classifier. Although the main focus of this paper is to present a general, theoretical framework for metric embedding in a NN setting, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on some benchmark datasets and show that it performs better than the Mahalanobis metric learning algorithm in terms of leave-one-out and generalization errors.	Metric Embedding for Nearest Neighbor Classification
1705.10306v1	We introduce AESMC: a method for using deep neural networks for simultaneous model learning and inference amortization in a broad family of structured probabilistic models. Starting with an unlabeled dataset and a partially specified underlying generative model, AESMC refines the generative model and learns efficient proposal distributions for SMC for performing inference in this model. Our approach relies on 1) efficiency of SMC in performing inference in structured probabilistic models and 2) flexibility of deep neural networks to model complex conditional probability distributions. We demonstrate that our approach provides a fast, accurate, easy-to-implement, and scalable means for carrying out parameter estimation in high-dimensional statistical models as well as simultaneous model learning and proposal amortization in neural network based models.	Auto-Encoding Sequential Monte Carlo
1412.4679v5	We introduce Bayesian multi-tensor factorization, a model that is the first Bayesian formulation for joint factorization of multiple matrices and tensors. The research problem generalizes the joint matrix-tensor factorization problem to arbitrary sets of tensors of any depth, including matrices, can be interpreted as unsupervised multi-view learning from multiple data tensors, and can be generalized to relax the usual trilinear tensor factorization assumptions. The result is a factorization of the set of tensors into factors shared by any subsets of the tensors, and factors private to individual tensors. We demonstrate the performance against existing baselines in multiple tensor factorization tasks in structural toxicogenomics and functional neuroimaging.	Bayesian multi-tensor factorization
1403.5994v1	Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be identifiable under the separability assumption, under which all the columns(or rows) of the input data matrix belong to the convex cone generated by only a few of these columns(or rows) [1]. In real applications, however, such separability assumption is hard to satisfy. Following [4] and [5], in this paper, we look at the Linear Programming (LP) based reformulation to locate the extreme rays of the convex cone but in a noisy setting. Furthermore, in order to deal with the large scale data, we employ First-Order Methods (FOM) to mitigate the computational complexity of LP, which primarily results from a large number of constraints. We show the performance of the algorithm on real and synthetic data sets.	First Order Methods for Robust Non-negative Matrix Factorization for  Large Scale Noisy Data
1605.04435v1	This volume is a collection of contributions from the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Interpretation in Neuroimaging (MLINI) at the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2015) conference. Modern multivariate statistical methods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being increasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state detection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysis methods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional signals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category of a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental disorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate approaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual imaging measurement in isolation. We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how questions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is now entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally important that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly evolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, there is an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context of rich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specific paradigms that pinpoint a single function, towards schemes for measuring the interaction with natural and more varied scene are made. The goal of the workshop is to pinpoint the most pressing issues and common challenges across the neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology and machine learning fields, and to sketch future directions and open questions in the light of novel methodology.

1606.04789v2	We introduce Network Maximal Correlation (NMC) as a multivariate measure of nonlinear association among random variables. NMC is defined via an optimization that infers transformations of variables by maximizing aggregate inner products between transformed variables. For finite discrete and jointly Gaussian random variables, we characterize a solution of the NMC optimization using basis expansion of functions over appropriate basis functions. For finite discrete variables, we propose an algorithm based on alternating conditional expectation to determine NMC. Moreover we propose a distributed algorithm to compute an approximation of NMC for large and dense graphs using graph partitioning. For finite discrete variables, we show that the probability of discrepancy greater than any given level between NMC and NMC computed using empirical distributions decays exponentially fast as the sample size grows. For jointly Gaussian variables, we show that under some conditions the NMC optimization is an instance of the Max-Cut problem. We then illustrate an application of NMC in inference of graphical model for bijective functions of jointly Gaussian variables. Finally, we show NMC's utility in a data application of learning nonlinear dependencies among genes in a cancer dataset.	Network Maximal Correlation
1612.08932v1	We provide a way to infer about existence of topological circularity in high-dimensional data sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ from its projection in $\mathbb{R}^2$ obtained through a fast manifold learning map as a function of the high-dimensional dataset $\mathbb{X}$ and a particular choice of a positive real $\sigma$ known as bandwidth parameter. At the same time we also provide a way to estimate the optimal bandwidth for fast manifold learning in this setting through minimization of these functions of bandwidth. We also provide limit theorems to characterize the behavior of our proposed functions of bandwidth.	Optimal bandwidth estimation for a fast manifold learning algorithm to  detect circular structure in high-dimensional data
1512.03308v2	One of the core problems in statistical models is the estimation of a posterior distribution. For topic models, the problem of posterior inference for individual texts is particularly important, especially when dealing with data streams, but is often intractable in the worst case. As a consequence, existing methods for posterior inference are approximate and do not have any guarantee on neither quality nor convergence rate. In this paper, we introduce a provably fast algorithm, namely Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (OPE), for posterior inference in topic models. OPE has more attractive properties than existing inference approaches, including theoretical guarantees on quality and fast rate of convergence to a local maximal/stationary point of the inference problem. The discussions about OPE are very general and hence can be easily employed in a wide range of contexts. Finally, we employ OPE to design three methods for learning Latent Dirichlet Allocation from text streams or large corpora. Extensive experiments demonstrate some superior behaviors of OPE and of our new learning methods.	Guaranteed inference in topic models
1512.07548v1	We show that the objective function of conventional k-means clustering can be expressed as the Frobenius norm of the difference of a data matrix and a low rank approximation of that data matrix. In short, we show that k-means clustering is a matrix factorization problem. These notes are meant as a reference and intended to provide a guided tour towards a result that is often mentioned but seldom made explicit in the literature.	k-Means Clustering Is Matrix Factorization
1106.0565v2	A number of recent work studied the effectiveness of feature selection using Lasso. It is known that under the restricted isometry properties (RIP), Lasso does not generally lead to the exact recovery of the set of nonzero coefficients, due to the looseness of convex relaxation. This paper considers the feature selection property of nonconvex regularization, where the solution is given by a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the local solution obtained by this procedure recovers the set of nonzero coefficients without suffering from the bias of Lasso relaxation, which complements parameter estimation results of this procedure.	Multi-stage Convex Relaxation for Feature Selection
1503.02768v2	We are concerned with obtaining novel concentration inequalities for the missing mass, i.e. the total probability mass of the outcomes not observed in the sample. We not only derive - for the first time - distribution-free Bernstein-like deviation bounds with sublinear exponents in deviation size for missing mass, but also improve the results of McAllester and Ortiz (2003) andBerend and Kontorovich (2013, 2012) for small deviations which is the most interesting case in learning theory. It is known that the majority of standard inequalities cannot be directly used to analyze heterogeneous sums i.e. sums whose terms have large difference in magnitude. Our generic and intuitive approach shows that the heterogeneity issue introduced in McAllester and Ortiz (2003) is resolvable at least in the case of missing mass via regulating the terms using our novel thresholding technique.	Novel Bernstein-like Concentration Inequalities for the Missing Mass
1102.1204v2	This paper treats the problem of screening for variables with high correlations in high dimensional data in which there can be many fewer samples than variables. We focus on threshold-based correlation screening methods for three related applications: screening for variables with large correlations within a single treatment (autocorrelation screening); screening for variables with large cross-correlations over two treatments (cross-correlation screening); screening for variables that have persistently large auto-correlations over two treatments (persistent-correlation screening). The novelty of correlation screening is that it identifies a smaller number of variables which are highly correlated with others, as compared to identifying a number of correlation parameters. Correlation screening suffers from a phase transition phenomenon: as the correlation threshold decreases the number of discoveries increases abruptly. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the mean number of discoveries and the phase transition thresholds as a function of the number of samples, the number of variables, and the joint sample distribution. We also show that under a weak dependency condition the number of discoveries is dominated by a Poisson random variable giving an asymptotic expression for the false positive rate. The correlation screening approach bears tremendous dividends in terms of the type and strength of the asymptotic results that can be obtained. It also overcomes some of the major hurdles faced by existing methods in the literature as correlation screening is naturally scalable to high dimension. Numerical results strongly validate the theory that is presented in this paper. We illustrate the application of the correlation screening methodology on a large scale gene-expression dataset, revealing a few influential variables that exhibit a significant amount of correlation over multiple treatments.	Large Scale Correlation Screening
1608.04290v1	This paper considers \emph{volume minimization} (VolMin)-based structured matrix factorization (SMF). VolMin is a factorization criterion that decomposes a given data matrix into a basis matrix times a structured coefficient matrix via finding the minimum-volume simplex that encloses all the columns of the data matrix. Recent work showed that VolMin guarantees the identifiability of the factor matrices under mild conditions that are realistic in a wide variety of applications. This paper focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of VolMin. On the theory side, exact equivalence of two independently developed sufficient conditions for VolMin identifiability is proven here, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of this aspect of VolMin. On the algorithm side, computational complexity and sensitivity to outliers are two key challenges associated with real-world applications of VolMin. These are addressed here via a new VolMin algorithm that handles volume regularization in a computationally simple way, and automatically detects and {iteratively downweights} outliers, simultaneously. Simulations and real-data experiments using a remotely sensed hyperspectral image and the Reuters document corpus are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.	Robust Volume Minimization-Based Matrix Factorization for Remote Sensing  and Document Clustering
1705.07283v2	Dropout-based regularization methods can be regarded as injecting random noise with pre-defined magnitude to different parts of the neural network during training. It was recently shown that Bayesian dropout procedure not only improves generalization but also leads to extremely sparse neural architectures by automatically setting the individual noise magnitude per weight. However, this sparsity can hardly be used for acceleration since it is unstructured. In the paper, we propose a new Bayesian model that takes into account the computational structure of neural networks and provides structured sparsity, e.g. removes neurons and/or convolutional channels in CNNs. To do this we inject noise to the neurons outputs while keeping the weights unregularized. We establish the probabilistic model with a proper truncated log-uniform prior over the noise and truncated log-normal variational approximation that ensures that the KL-term in the evidence lower bound is computed in closed-form. The model leads to structured sparsity by removing elements with a low SNR from the computation graph and provides significant acceleration on a number of deep neural architectures. The model is easy to implement as it can be formulated as a separate dropout-like layer.	Structured Bayesian Pruning via Log-Normal Multiplicative Noise
1711.10581v2	There is tremendous interest in precision medicine as a means to improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatment to individual characteristics. An individualized treatment rule formalizes precision medicine as a map from patient information to a recommended treatment. A rule is defined to be optimal if it maximizes the mean of a scalar outcome in a population of interest, e.g., symptom reduction. However, clinical and intervention scientists often must balance multiple and possibly competing outcomes, e.g., symptom reduction and the risk of an adverse event. One approach to precision medicine in this setting is to elicit a composite outcome which balances all competing outcomes; unfortunately, eliciting a composite outcome directly from patients is difficult without a high-quality instrument and an expert-derived composite outcome may not account for heterogeneity in patient preferences. We consider estimation of composite outcomes using observational data under the assumption that clinicians are approximately (i.e., imperfectly) making decisions to maximize individual patient utility. Estimated composite outcomes are subsequently used to construct an estimator of an individualized treatment rule that maximizes the mean of patient-specific composite outcomes. Furthermore, the estimated composite outcomes and estimated optimal individualized treatment rule can provide new insights into patient preference heterogeneity, clinician behavior, and the value of precision medicine in a given domain. We derive inference procedures for the proposed estimators under mild conditions and demonstrate their finite sample performance through a suite of simulation experiments and an illustrative application to data from a study of bipolar depression.	Estimation and Optimization of Composite Outcomes
1703.03373v2	We present mlrMBO, a flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization (MBO), also known as Bayesian optimization, which addresses the problem of expensive black-box optimization by approximating the given objective function through a surrogate regression model. It is designed for both single- and multi-objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and conditional parameters. Additional features include multi-point batch proposal, parallelization, visualization, logging and error-handling. mlrMBO is implemented in a modular fashion, such that single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use cases, e.g., any regression learner from the mlr toolbox for machine learning can be used, and infill criteria and infill optimizers are easily exchangeable. We empirically demonstrate that mlrMBO provides state-of-the-art performance by comparing it on different benchmark scenarios against a wide range of other optimizers, including DiceOptim, rBayesianOptimization, SPOT, SMAC, Spearmint, and Hyperopt.	mlrMBO: A Modular Framework for Model-Based Optimization of Expensive  Black-Box Functions
1708.02122v1	Very few K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) ensembles exist, despite the efficacy of this approach in regression, classification, and outlier detection. Those that do exist focus on bagging features, rather than varying k or bagging observations; it is unknown whether varying k or bagging observations can improve prediction. Given recent studies from topological data analysis, varying k may function like multiscale topological methods, providing stability and better prediction, as well as increased ensemble diversity. This paper explores 7 KNN ensemble algorithms combining bagged features, bagged observations, and varied k to understand how each of these contribute to model fit. Specifically, these algorithms are tested on Tweedie regression problems through simulations and 6 real datasets; results are compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models including extreme learning machines, random forest, boosted regression, and Morse-Smale regression. Results on simulations suggest gains from varying k above and beyond bagging features or samples, as well as the robustness of KNN ensembles to the curse of dimensionality. KNN regression ensembles perform favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms and dramatically improve performance over KNN regression. Further, real dataset results suggest varying k is a good strategy in general (particularly for difficult Tweedie regression problems) and that KNN regression ensembles often outperform state-of-the-art methods. These results for k-varying ensembles echo recent theoretical results in topological data analysis, where multidimensional filter functions and multiscale coverings provide stability and performance gains over single-dimensional filters and single-scale covering. This opens up the possibility of leveraging multiscale neighborhoods and multiple measures of local geometry in ensemble methods.

1705.01342v2	Is it possible to perform linear regression on datasets whose labels are shuffled with respect to the inputs? We explore this question by proposing several estimators that recover the weights of a noisy linear model from labels that are shuffled by an unknown permutation. We show that the analog of the classical least-squares estimator produces inconsistent estimates in this setting, and introduce an estimator based on the self-moments of the input features and labels. We study the regimes in which each estimator excels, and generalize the estimators to the setting where partial ordering information is available in the form of experiments replicated independently. The result is a framework that enables robust inference, as we demonstrate by experiments on both synthetic and standard datasets, where we are able to recover approximate weights using only shuffled labels. Our work demonstrates that linear regression in the absence of complete ordering information is possible and can be of practical interest, particularly in experiments that characterize populations of particles, such as flow cytometry.	Linear Regression with Shuffled Labels
1612.03957v3	The stochastic variational inference (SVI) paradigm, which combines variational inference, natural gradients, and stochastic updates, was recently proposed for large-scale data analysis in conjugate Bayesian models and demonstrated to be effective in several problems. This paper studies a family of Bayesian latent variable models with two levels of hidden variables but without any conjugacy requirements, making several contributions in this context. The first is observing that SVI, with an improved structured variational approximation, is applicable under more general conditions than previously thought with the only requirement being that the approximating variational distribution be in the same family as the prior. The resulting approach, Monte Carlo Structured SVI (MC-SSVI), significantly extends the scope of SVI, enabling large-scale learning in non-conjugate models. For models with latent Gaussian variables we propose a hybrid algorithm, using both standard and natural gradients, which is shown to improve stability and convergence. Applications in mixed effects models, sparse Gaussian processes, probabilistic matrix factorization and correlated topic models demonstrate the generality of the approach and the advantages of the proposed algorithms.

1009.3958v1	We propose a novel reformulation of the stochastic optimal control problem as an approximate inference problem, demonstrating, that such a interpretation leads to new practical methods for the original problem. In particular we characterise a novel class of iterative solutions to the stochastic optimal control problem based on a natural relaxation of the exact dual formulation. These theoretical insights are applied to the Reinforcement Learning problem where they lead to new model free, off policy methods for discrete and continuous problems.

1608.04048v1	Machine learning methods are used to discover complex nonlinear relationships in biological and medical data. However, sophisticated learning models are computationally unfeasible for data with millions of features. Here we introduce the first feature selection method for nonlinear learning problems that can scale up to large, ultra-high dimensional biological data. More specifically, we scale up the novel Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion Lasso (HSIC Lasso) to handle millions of features with tens of thousand samples. The proposed method is guaranteed to find an optimal subset of maximally predictive features with minimal redundancy, yielding higher predictive power and improved interpretability. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through applications to classify phenotypes based on module expression in human prostate cancer patients and to detect enzymes among protein structures. We achieve high accuracy with as few as 20 out of one million features --- a dimensionality reduction of 99.998%. Our algorithm can be implemented on commodity cloud computing platforms. The dramatic reduction of features may lead to the ubiquitous deployment of sophisticated prediction models in mobile health care applications.

1102.0844v1	A collaborative convex framework for factoring a data matrix $X$ into a non-negative product $AS$, with a sparse coefficient matrix $S$, is proposed. We restrict the columns of the dictionary matrix $A$ to coincide with certain columns of the data matrix $X$, thereby guaranteeing a physically meaningful dictionary and dimensionality reduction. We use $l_{1,\infty}$ regularization to select the dictionary from the data and show this leads to an exact convex relaxation of $l_0$ in the case of distinct noise free data. We also show how to relax the restriction-to-$X$ constraint by initializing an alternating minimization approach with the solution of the convex model, obtaining a dictionary close to but not necessarily in $X$. We focus on applications of the proposed framework to hyperspectral endmember and abundances identification and also show an application to blind source separation of NMR data.

1211.3038v4	We prove that the density function of the gradient of a sufficiently smooth function $S : \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, obtained via a random variable transformation of a uniformly distributed random variable, is increasingly closely approximated by the normalized power spectrum of $\phi=\exp\left(\frac{iS}{\tau}\right)$ as the free parameter $\tau \rightarrow 0$. The result is shown using the stationary phase approximation and standard integration techniques and requires proper ordering of limits. We highlight a relationship with the well-known characteristic function approach to density estimation, and detail why our result is distinct from this approach.

1610.06665v1	Recent advances in Bayesian learning with large-scale data have witnessed emergence of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC), such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian MCMC (SGHMC), and the stochastic gradient thermostat. While finite-time convergence properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In this paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and develop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their asymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric splitting integrator, the {\em mean square error} (MSE) of the posterior average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$ iterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs are also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method in two large-scale real applications.

1308.5609v2	Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been one of the most popular methods for frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Despite its efficiency, a potential problem is that using pre-constructed sine-cosine waves as the required reference signals in the CCA method often does not result in the optimal recognition accuracy due to their lack of features from the real EEG data. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel method based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (MsetCCA) to optimize the reference signals used in the CCA method for SSVEP frequency recognition. The MsetCCA method learns multiple linear transforms that implement joint spatial filtering to maximize the overall correlation among canonical variates, and hence extracts SSVEP common features from multiple sets of EEG data recorded at the same stimulus frequency. The optimized reference signals are formed by combination of the common features and completely based on training data. Experimental study with EEG data from ten healthy subjects demonstrates that the MsetCCA method improves the recognition accuracy of SSVEP frequency in comparison with the CCA method and other two competing methods (multiway CCA (MwayCCA) and phase constrained CCA (PCCA)), especially for a small number of channels and a short time window length. The superiority indicates that the proposed MsetCCA method is a new promising candidate for frequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCIs.	Frequency Recognition in SSVEP-based BCI using Multiset Canonical  Correlation Analysis
1312.4664v4	This paper addresses the problem of filtering with a state-space model. Standard approaches for filtering assume that a probabilistic model for observations (i.e. the observation model) is given explicitly or at least parametrically. We consider a setting where this assumption is not satisfied; we assume that the knowledge of the observation model is only provided by examples of state-observation pairs. This setting is important and appears when state variables are defined as quantities that are very different from the observations. We propose Kernel Monte Carlo Filter, a novel filtering method that is focused on this setting. Our approach is based on the framework of kernel mean embeddings, which enables nonparametric posterior inference using the state-observation examples. The proposed method represents state distributions as weighted samples, propagates these samples by sampling, estimates the state posteriors by Kernel Bayes' Rule, and resamples by Kernel Herding. In particular, the sampling and resampling procedures are novel in being expressed using kernel mean embeddings, so we theoretically analyze their behaviors. We reveal the following properties, which are similar to those of corresponding procedures in particle methods: (1) the performance of sampling can degrade if the effective sample size of a weighted sample is small; (2) resampling improves the sampling performance by increasing the effective sample size. We first demonstrate these theoretical findings by synthetic experiments. Then we show the effectiveness of the proposed filter by artificial and real data experiments, which include vision-based mobile robot localization.	Filtering with State-Observation Examples via Kernel Monte Carlo Filter
1202.0855v1	"A significant challenge to make learning techniques more suitable for general purpose use is to move beyond i) complete supervision, ii) low dimensional data, iii) a single task and single view per instance. Solving these challenges allows working with ""Big Data"" problems that are typically high dimensional with multiple (but possibly incomplete) labelings and views. While other work has addressed each of these problems separately, in this paper we show how to address them together, namely semi-supervised dimension reduction for multi-task and multi-view learning (SSDR-MML), which performs optimization for dimension reduction and label inference in semi-supervised setting. The proposed framework is designed to handle both multi-task and multi-view learning settings, and can be easily adapted to many useful applications. Information obtained from all tasks and views is combined via reconstruction errors in a linear fashion that can be efficiently solved using an alternating optimization scheme. Our formulation has a number of advantages. We explicitly model the information combining mechanism as a data structure (a weight/nearest-neighbor matrix) which allows investigating fundamental questions in multi-task and multi-view learning. We address one such question by presenting a general measure to quantify the success of simultaneous learning of multiple tasks or from multiple views. We show that our SSDR-MML approach can outperform many state-of-the-art baseline methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of connecting dimension reduction and learning."	A Reconstruction Error Formulation for Semi-Supervised Multi-task and  Multi-view Learning
1107.4390v4	We present a multi-task learning approach to jointly estimate the means of multiple independent data sets. The proposed multi-task averaging (MTA) algorithm results in a convex combination of the single-task maximum likelihood estimates. We derive the optimal minimum risk estimator and the minimax estimator, and show that these estimators can be efficiently estimated. Simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that MTA estimators often outperform both single-task and James-Stein estimators.	Multi-Task Averaging
1510.05078v3	Robust Bayesian models are appealing alternatives to standard models, providing protection from data that contains outliers or other departures from the model assumptions. Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a case-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture models, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to robust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a robust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use our method to study robust variants of several models, including linear regression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic models. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches, especially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation.	A General Method for Robust Bayesian Modeling
1505.07765v3	A recurring problem when building probabilistic latent variable models is regularization and model selection, for instance, the choice of the dimensionality of the latent space. In the context of belief networks with latent variables, this problem has been adressed with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) employing Monte Carlo inference. We present a variational inference approach to ARD for Deep Generative Models using doubly stochastic variational inference to provide fast and scalable learning. We show empirical results on a standard dataset illustrating the effects of contracting the latent space automatically. We show that the resulting latent representations are significantly more compact without loss of expressive power of the learned models.	Automatic Relevance Determination For Deep Generative Models
1802.00568v1	Topic models are Bayesian models that are frequently used to capture the latent structure of certain corpora of documents or images. Each data element in such a corpus (for instance each item in a collection of scientific articles) is regarded as a convex combination of a small number of vectors corresponding to `topics' or `components'. The weights are assumed to have a Dirichlet prior distribution. The standard approach towards approximating the posterior is to use variational inference algorithms, and in particular a mean field approximation. We show that this approach suffers from an instability that can produce misleading conclusions. Namely, for certain regimes of the model parameters, variational inference outputs a non-trivial decomposition into topics. However --for the same parameter values-- the data contain no actual information about the true decomposition, and hence the output of the algorithm is uncorrelated with the true topic decomposition. Among other consequences, the estimated posterior mean is significantly wrong, and estimated Bayesian credible regions do not achieve the nominal coverage. We discuss how this instability is remedied by more accurate mean field approximations.	An Instability in Variational Inference for Topic Models
1710.06595v2	Robustness to outliers is a central issue in real-world machine learning applications. While replacing a model to a heavy-tailed one (e.g., from Gaussian to Student-t) is a standard approach for robustification, it can only be applied to simple models. In this paper, based on Zellner's optimization and variational formulation of Bayesian inference, we propose an outlier-robust pseudo-Bayesian variational method by replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence used for data fitting to a robust divergence such as the beta- and gamma-divergences. An advantage of our approach is that superior but complex models such as deep networks can also be handled. We theoretically prove that, for deep networks with ReLU activation functions, the \emph{influence function} in our proposed method is bounded, while it is unbounded in the ordinary variational inference. This implies that our proposed method is robust to both of input and output outliers, while the ordinary variational method is not. We experimentally demonstrate that our robust variational method outperforms ordinary variational inference in regression and classification with deep networks.	Variational Inference based on Robust Divergences
1106.4431v1	This paper considers the robust and efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression with a Student-t observation model. The challenge with the Student-t model is the analytically intractable inference which is why several approximative methods have been proposed. The expectation propagation (EP) has been found to be a very accurate method in many empirical studies but the convergence of the EP is known to be problematic with models containing non-log-concave site functions such as the Student-t distribution. In this paper we illustrate the situations where the standard EP fails to converge and review different modifications and alternative algorithms for improving the convergence. We demonstrate that convergence problems may occur during the type-II maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the hyperparameters and show that the standard EP may not converge in the MAP values in some difficult cases. We present a robust implementation which relies primarily on parallel EP updates and utilizes a moment-matching-based double-loop algorithm with adaptively selected step size in difficult cases. The predictive performance of the EP is compared to the Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations.	Gaussian Process Regression with a Student-t Likelihood
1401.4988v2	Undirected graphical models known as Markov networks are popular for a wide variety of applications ranging from statistical physics to computational biology. Traditionally, learning of the network structure has been done under the assumption of chordality which ensures that efficient scoring methods can be used. In general, non-chordal graphs have intractable normalizing constants which renders the calculation of Bayesian and other scores difficult beyond very small-scale systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest towards the use of regularized pseudo-likelihood methods for structural learning of large-scale Markov network models, as such an approach avoids the assumption of chordality. The currently available methods typically necessitate the use of a tuning parameter to adapt the level of regularization for a particular dataset, which can be optimized for example by cross-validation. Here we introduce a Bayesian version of pseudo-likelihood scoring of Markov networks, which enables an automatic regularization through marginalization over the nuisance parameters in the model. We prove consistency of the resulting MPL estimator for the network structure via comparison with the pseudo information criterion. Identification of the MPL-optimal network on a prescanned graph space is considered with both greedy hill climbing and exact pseudo-Boolean optimization algorithms. We find that for reasonable sample sizes the hill climbing approach most often identifies networks that are at a negligible distance from the restricted global optimum. Using synthetic and existing benchmark networks, the marginal pseudo-likelihood method is shown to generally perform favorably against recent popular inference methods for Markov networks.	Marginal Pseudo-Likelihood Learning of Markov Network structures
1707.06626v2	We propose a simple algorithm to train stochastic neural networks to draw samples from given target distributions for probabilistic inference. Our method is based on iteratively adjusting the neural network parameters so that the output changes along a Stein variational gradient direction (Liu & Wang, 2016) that maximally decreases the KL divergence with the target distribution. Our method works for any target distribution specified by their unnormalized density function, and can train any black-box architectures that are differentiable in terms of the parameters we want to adapt. We demonstrate our method with a number of applications, including variational autoencoder (VAE) with expressive encoders to model complex latent space structures, and hyper-parameter learning of MCMC samplers that allows Bayesian inference to adaptively improve itself when seeing more data.	Learning to Draw Samples with Amortized Stein Variational Gradient  Descent
1208.4411v1	A single, stationary topic model such as latent Dirichlet allocation is inappropriate for modeling corpora that span long time periods, as the popularity of topics is likely to change over time. A number of models that incorporate time have been proposed, but in general they either exhibit limited forms of temporal variation, or require computationally expensive inference methods. In this paper we propose non-parametric Topics over Time (npTOT), a model for time-varying topics that allows an unbounded number of topics and exible distribution over the temporal variations in those topics' popularity. We develop a collapsed Gibbs sampler for the proposed model and compare against existing models on synthetic and real document sets.	A non-parametric mixture model for topic modeling over time
1111.2667v2	The graphical lasso (glasso) is a widely-used fast algorithm for estimating sparse inverse covariance matrices. The glasso solves an L1 penalized maximum likelihood problem and is available as an R library on CRAN. The output from the glasso, a regularized covariance matrix estimate a sparse inverse covariance matrix estimate, not only identify a graphical model but can also serve as intermediate inputs into multivariate procedures such as PCA, LDA, MANOVA, and others. The glasso indeed produces a covariance matrix estimate which solves the L1 penalized optimization problem in a dual sense; however, the method for producing the inverse covariance matrix estimator after this optimization is inexact and may produce asymmetric estimates. This problem is exacerbated when the amount of L1 regularization that is applied is small, which in turn is more likely to occur if the true underlying inverse covariance matrix is not sparse. The lack of symmetry can potentially have consequences. First, it implies that the covariance and inverse covariance estimates are not numerical inverses of one another, and second, asymmetry can possibly lead to negative or complex eigenvalues,rendering many multivariate procedures which may depend on the inverse covariance estimator unusable. We demonstrate this problem, explain its causes, and propose possible remedies.	A note on the lack of symmetry in the graphical lasso
1704.01871v1	Cluster analysis of very high dimensional data can benefit from the properties of such high dimensionality. Informally expressed, in this work, our focus is on the analogous situation when the dimensionality is moderate to small, relative to a massively sized set of observations. Mathematically expressed, these are the dual spaces of observations and attributes. The point cloud of observations is in attribute space, and the point cloud of attributes is in observation space. In this paper, we begin by summarizing various perspectives related to methodologies that are used in multivariate analytics. We draw on these to establish an efficient clustering processing pipeline, both partitioning and hierarchical clustering.	Massive Data Clustering in Moderate Dimensions from the Dual Spaces of  Observation and Attribute Data Clouds
1801.01961v1	Basis adaptation in Homogeneous Chaos spaces rely on a suitable rotation of the underlying Gaussian germ. Several rotations have been proposed in the literature resulting in adaptations with different convergence properties. In this paper we present a new adaptation mechanism that builds on compressive sensing algorithms, resulting in a reduced polynomial chaos approximation with optimal sparsity. The developed adaptation algorithm consists of a two-step optimization procedure that computes the optimal coefficients and the input projection matrix of a low dimensional chaos expansion with respect to an optimally rotated basis. We demonstrate the attractive features of our algorithm through several numerical examples including the application on Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations of turbulent combustion in a HIFiRE scramjet engine.

1601.01966v1	In this paper, a novel approach for coding nominal data is proposed. For the given nominal data, a rank in a form of complex number is assigned. The proposed method does not lose any information about the attribute and brings other properties previously unknown. The approach based on these knew properties can been used for classification. The analyzed example shows that classification with the use of coded nominal data or both numerical as well as coded nominal data is more effective than the classification, which uses only numerical data.	Numerical Coding of Nominal Data
1101.2489v3	Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to analyze causal relations between continuous variables. In such frameworks, linear acyclic models are typically used to model the data-generating process of variables. Recently, it was shown that use of non-Gaussianity identifies the full structure of a linear acyclic model, i.e., a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths, without using any prior knowledge on the network structure, which is not the case with conventional methods. However, existing estimation methods are based on iterative search algorithms and may not converge to a correct solution in a finite number of steps. In this paper, we propose a new direct method to estimate a causal ordering and connection strengths based on non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the previous methods, our algorithm requires no algorithmic parameters and is guaranteed to converge to the right solution within a small fixed number of steps if the data strictly follows the model.

0909.4386v1	We describe a method for inferring linear causal relations among multi-dimensional variables. The idea is to use an asymmetry between the distributions of cause and effect that occurs if both the covariance matrix of the cause and the structure matrix mapping cause to the effect are independently chosen. The method works for both stochastic and deterministic causal relations, provided that the dimensionality is sufficiently high (in some experiments, 5 was enough). It is applicable to Gaussian as well as non-Gaussian data.	Telling cause from effect based on high-dimensional observations
1109.0895v1	A nonlinear channel estimator using complex Least Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) is proposed for pilot-aided OFDM system and applied to Long Term Evolution (LTE) downlink under high mobility conditions. The estimation algorithm makes use of the reference signals to estimate the total frequency response of the highly selective multipath channel in the presence of non-Gaussian impulse noise interfering with pilot signals. Thus, the algorithm maps trained data into a high dimensional feature space and uses the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle to carry out the regression estimation for the frequency response function of the highly selective channel. The simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method which has good performance and high precision to track the variations of the fading channels compared to the conventional LS method and it is robust at high speed mobility.

1603.03629v2	We develop Square Root Graphical Models (SQR), a novel class of parametric graphical models that provides multivariate generalizations of univariate exponential family distributions. Previous multivariate graphical models [Yang et al. 2015] did not allow positive dependencies for the exponential and Poisson generalizations. However, in many real-world datasets, variables clearly have positive dependencies. For example, the airport delay time in New York---modeled as an exponential distribution---is positively related to the delay time in Boston. With this motivation, we give an example of our model class derived from the univariate exponential distribution that allows for almost arbitrary positive and negative dependencies with only a mild condition on the parameter matrix---a condition akin to the positive definiteness of the Gaussian covariance matrix. Our Poisson generalization allows for both positive and negative dependencies without any constraints on the parameter values. We also develop parameter estimation methods using node-wise regressions with $\ell_1$ regularization and likelihood approximation methods using sampling. Finally, we demonstrate our exponential generalization on a synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset of airport delay times.

1608.07494v3	We improve existing instability-based methods for the selection of the number of clusters $k$ in cluster analysis by normalizing instability. In contrast to existing instability methods which only perform well for bounded sequences of small $k$, our method performs well across the whole sequence of possible $k$. In addition, we compare for the first time model-based and model-free variants of $k$ selection via cluster instability and find that their performance is similar. We make our method available in the R-package \verb+cstab+.	Estimating the Number of Clusters via Normalized Cluster Instability
1611.06800v1	Over the years, ensemble methods have become a staple of machine learning. Similarly, generalized linear models (GLMs) have become very popular for a wide variety of statistical inference tasks. The former have been shown to enhance out- of-sample predictive power and the latter possess easy interpretability. Recently, ensembles of GLMs have been proposed as a possibility. On the downside, this approach loses the interpretability that GLMs possess. We show that minimum description length (MDL)-motivated compression of the inferred ensembles can be used to recover interpretability without much, if any, downside to performance and illustrate on a number of standard classification data sets.	MDL-motivated compression of GLM ensembles increases interpretability  and retains predictive power
1110.4347v3	There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that exact nearest neighbour search in high-dimensional spaces is affected by the curse of dimensionality at a fundamental level. Does it necessarily mean that the same is true for k nearest neighbours based learning algorithms such as the k-NN classifier? We analyse this question at a number of levels and show that the answer is different at each of them. As our first main observation, we show the consistency of a k approximate nearest neighbour classifier. However, the performance of the classifier in very high dimensions is provably unstable. As our second main observation, we point out that the existing model for statistical learning is oblivious of dimension of the domain and so every learning problem admits a universally consistent deterministic reduction to the one-dimensional case by means of a Borel isomorphism.	Is the k-NN classifier in high dimensions affected by the curse of  dimensionality?

1708.00132v2	Tensor train (TT) decomposition provides a space-efficient representation for higher-order tensors. Despite its advantage, we face two crucial limitations when we apply the TT decomposition to machine learning problems: the lack of statistical theory and of scalable algorithms. In this paper, we address the limitations. First, we introduce a convex relaxation of the TT decomposition problem and derive its error bound for the tensor completion task. Next, we develop an alternating optimization method with a randomization technique, in which the time complexity is as efficient as the space complexity is. In experiments, we numerically confirm the derived bounds and empirically demonstrate the performance of our method with a real higher-order tensor.

1801.09136v1	Any gradient descent optimization requires to choose a learning rate. With deeper and deeper models, tuning that learning rate can easily become tedious and does not necessarily lead to an ideal convergence. We propose a variation of the gradient descent algorithm in the which the learning rate is not fixed. Instead, we learn the learning rate itself, either by another gradient descent (first-order method), or by Newton's method (second-order). This way, gradient descent for any machine learning algorithm can be optimized.	Gradient descent revisited via an adaptive online learning rate
1207.6684v2	Recently, sparsity-based algorithms are proposed for super-resolution spectrum estimation. However, to achieve adequately high resolution in real-world signal analysis, the dictionary atoms have to be close to each other in frequency, thereby resulting in a coherent design. The popular convex compressed sensing methods break down in presence of high coherence and large noise. We propose a new regularization approach to handle model collinearity and obtain parsimonious frequency selection simultaneously. It takes advantage of the pairing structure of sine and cosine atoms in the frequency dictionary. A probabilistic spectrum screening is also developed for fast computation in high dimensions. A data-resampling version of high-dimensional Bayesian Information Criterion is used to determine the regularization parameters. Experiments show the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms in challenging situations with small sample size, high frequency resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratio.

1603.04381v2	We consider the problem of maximizing an unknown function over a compact and convex set using as few observations as possible. We observe that the optimization of the function essentially relies on learning the induced bipartite ranking rule of f. Based on this idea, we relate global optimization to bipartite ranking which allows to address problems with high dimensional input space, as well as cases of functions with weak regularity properties. The paper introduces novel meta-algorithms for global optimization which rely on the choice of any bipartite ranking method. Theoretical properties are provided as well as convergence guarantees and equivalences between various optimization methods are obtained as a by-product. Eventually, numerical evidence is given to show that the main algorithm of the paper which adapts empirically to the underlying ranking structure essentially outperforms existing state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms in typical benchmarks.	A ranking approach to global optimization
1606.08793v3	Deep learning methods such as multitask neural networks have recently been applied to ligand-based virtual screening and other drug discovery applications. Using a set of industrial ADMET datasets, we compare neural networks to standard baseline models and analyze multitask learning effects with both random cross-validation and a more relevant temporal validation scheme. We confirm that multitask learning can provide modest benefits over single-task models and show that smaller datasets tend to benefit more than larger datasets from multitask learning. Additionally, we find that adding massive amounts of side information is not guaranteed to improve performance relative to simpler multitask learning. Our results emphasize that multitask effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the use of dataset-specific models to maximize overall performance.

1104.4512v1	Notwithstanding the popularity of conventional clustering algorithms such as K-means and probabilistic clustering, their clustering results are sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data. Even a few outliers can compromise the ability of these algorithms to identify meaningful hidden structures rendering their outcome unreliable. This paper develops robust clustering algorithms that not only aim to cluster the data, but also to identify the outliers. The novel approaches rely on the infrequent presence of outliers in the data which translates to sparsity in a judiciously chosen domain. Capitalizing on the sparsity in the outlier domain, outlier-aware robust K-means and probabilistic clustering approaches are proposed. Their novelty lies on identifying outliers while effecting sparsity in the outlier domain through carefully chosen regularization. A block coordinate descent approach is developed to obtain iterative algorithms with convergence guarantees and small excess computational complexity with respect to their non-robust counterparts. Kernelized versions of the robust clustering algorithms are also developed to efficiently handle high-dimensional data, identify nonlinearly separable clusters, or even cluster objects that are not represented by vectors. Numerical tests on both synthetic and real datasets validate the performance and applicability of the novel algorithms.	Robust Clustering Using Outlier-Sparsity Regularization
1111.6473v1	Driven by a large number of potential applications in areas like bioinformatics, information retrieval and social network analysis, the problem setting of inferring relations between pairs of data objects has recently been investigated quite intensively in the machine learning community. To this end, current approaches typically consider datasets containing crisp relations, so that standard classification methods can be adopted. However, relations between objects like similarities and preferences are often expressed in a graded manner in real-world applications. A general kernel-based framework for learning relations from data is introduced here. It extends existing approaches because both crisp and graded relations are considered, and it unifies existing approaches because different types of graded relations can be modeled, including symmetric and reciprocal relations. This framework establishes important links between recent developments in fuzzy set theory and machine learning. Its usefulness is demonstrated through various experiments on synthetic and real-world data.	A kernel-based framework for learning graded relations from data
1510.05576v1	In this paper, we consider the problem of stochastic optimization under a bandit feedback model. We generalize the GP-UCB algorithm [Srinivas and al., 2012] to arbitrary kernels and search spaces. To do so, we use a notion of localized chaining to control the supremum of a Gaussian process, and provide a novel optimization scheme based on the computation of covering numbers. The theoretical bounds we obtain on the cumulative regret are more generic and present the same convergence rates as the GP-UCB algorithm. Finally, the algorithm is shown to be empirically more efficient than its natural competitors on simple and complex input spaces.	Optimization for Gaussian Processes via Chaining
1104.5341v2	A linear non-Gaussian structural equation model called LiNGAM is an identifiable model for exploratory causal analysis. Previous methods estimate a causal ordering of variables and their connection strengths based on a single dataset. However, in many application domains, data are obtained under different conditions, that is, multiple datasets are obtained rather than a single dataset. In this paper, we present a new method to jointly estimate multiple LiNGAMs under the assumption that the models share a causal ordering but may have different connection strengths and differently distributed variables. In simulations, the new method estimates the models more accurately than estimating them separately.	Joint estimation of linear non-Gaussian acyclic models
1512.01947v1	In neuroimaging data analysis, Gaussian graphical models are often used to model statistical dependencies across spatially remote brain regions known as functional connectivity. Typically, data is collected across a cohort of subjects and the scientific objectives consist of estimating population and subject-specific graphical models. A third objective that is often overlooked involves quantifying inter-subject variability and thus identifying regions or sub-networks that demonstrate heterogeneity across subjects. Such information is fundamental in order to thoroughly understand the human connectome. We propose Mixed Neighborhood Selection in order to simultaneously address the three aforementioned objectives. By recasting covariance selection as a neighborhood selection problem we are able to efficiently learn the topology of each node. We introduce an additional mixed effect component to neighborhood selection in order to simultaneously estimate a graphical model for the population of subjects as well as for each individual subject. The proposed method is validated empirically through a series of simulations and applied to resting state data for healthy subjects taken from the ABIDE consortium.	Learning population and subject-specific brain connectivity networks via  Mixed Neighborhood Selection
1311.1911v3	Most Machine Learning (ML) methods, from clustering to classification, rely on a distance function to describe relationships between datapoints. For complex datasets it is hard to avoid making some arbitrary choices when defining a distance function. To compare images, one must choose a spatial scale, for signals, a temporal scale. The right scale is hard to pin down and it is preferable when results do not depend too tightly on the exact value one picked. Topological data analysis seeks to address this issue by focusing on the notion of neighbourhood instead of distance. It is shown that in some cases a simpler solution is available. It can be checked how strongly distance relationships depend on a hyperparameter using dimensionality reduction. A variant of dynamical multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) is formulated, which embeds datapoints as curves. The resulting algorithm is based on the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) and provides a simple and efficient way of visualizing changes and invariances in distance patterns as a hyperparameter is varied. A variant to analyze the dependence on multiple hyperparameters is also presented. A cMDS algorithm that is straightforward to implement, use and extend is provided. To illustrate the possibilities of cMDS, cMDS is applied to several real-world data sets.	Visualizing the Effects of a Changing Distance on Data Using Continuous  Embeddings
1703.04335v1	We propose a novel Bayesian Optimization approach for black-box functions with an environmental variable whose value determines the tradeoff between evaluation cost and the fidelity of the evaluations. Further, we use a novel approach to sampling support points, allowing faster construction of the acquisition function. This allows us to achieve optimization with lower overheads than previous approaches and is implemented for a more general class of problem. We show this approach to be effective on synthetic and real world benchmark problems.	Practical Bayesian Optimization for Variable Cost Objectives
1510.00850v3	A latent space model for a family of random graphs assigns real-valued vectors to nodes of the graph such that edge probabilities are determined by latent positions. Latent space models provide a natural statistical framework for graph visualizing and clustering. A latent space model of particular interest is the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG), which can be fit using an efficient spectral method; however, this method is based on a heuristic that can fail, even in simple cases. Here, we consider a closely related latent space model, the Logistic RDPG, which uses a logistic link function to map from latent positions to edge likelihoods. Over this model, we show that asymptotically exact maximum likelihood inference of latent position vectors can be achieved using an efficient spectral method. Our method involves computing top eigenvectors of a normalized adjacency matrix and scaling eigenvectors using a regression step. The novel regression scaling step is an essential part of the proposed method. In simulations, we show that our proposed method is more accurate and more robust than common practices. We also show the effectiveness of our approach over standard real networks of the karate club and political blogs.	Maximum Likelihood Latent Space Embedding of Logistic Random Dot Product  Graphs
1705.05950v5	Kernel methods are popular in clustering due to their generality and discriminating power. However, we show that many kernel clustering criteria have density biases theoretically explaining some practically significant artifacts empirically observed in the past. For example, we provide conditions and formally prove the density mode isolation bias in kernel K-means for a common class of kernels. We call it Breiman's bias due to its similarity to the histogram mode isolation previously discovered by Breiman in decision tree learning with Gini impurity. We also extend our analysis to other popular kernel clustering methods, e.g. average/normalized cut or dominant sets, where density biases can take different forms. For example, splitting isolated points by cut-based criteria is essentially the sparsest subset bias, which is the opposite of the density mode bias. Our findings suggest that a principled solution for density biases in kernel clustering should directly address data inhomogeneity. We show that density equalization can be implicitly achieved using either locally adaptive weights or locally adaptive kernels. Moreover, density equalization makes many popular kernel clustering objectives equivalent. Our synthetic and real data experiments illustrate density biases and proposed solutions. We anticipate that theoretical understanding of kernel clustering limitations and their principled solutions will be important for a broad spectrum of data analysis applications across the disciplines.

1608.01398v3	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlates marker variation with trait variation in a sample of individuals. Each study subject is genotyped at a multitude of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) spanning the genome. Here we assume that subjects are unrelated and collected at random and that trait values are normally distributed or transformed to normality. Over the past decade, researchers have been remarkably successful in applying GWAS analysis to hundreds of traits. The massive amount of data produced in these studies present unique computational challenges. Penalized regression with LASSO or MCP penalties is capable of selecting a handful of associated SNPs from millions of potential SNPs. Unfortunately, model selection can be corrupted by false positives and false negatives, obscuring the genetic underpinning of a trait. This paper introduces the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm to the GWAS analysis of continuous traits. Our parallel implementation of IHT accommodates SNP genotype compression and exploits multiple CPU cores and graphics processing units (GPUs). This allows statistical geneticists to leverage commodity desktop computers in GWAS analysis and to avoid supercomputing. We evaluate IHT performance on both simulated and real GWAS data and conclude that it reduces false positive and false negative rates while remaining competitive in computational time with penalized regression.

1110.4300v1	Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data. These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold). We show that k-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query x and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at x vary with radius. Furthermore, we show a simple way to choose k = k(x) locally at any x so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at x in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of x. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure.	k-NN Regression Adapts to Local Intrinsic Dimension
1202.3771v1	We describe a new technique for computing lower-bounds on the minimum energy configuration of a planar Markov Random Field (MRF). Our method successively adds large numbers of constraints and enforces consistency over binary projections of the original problem state space. These constraints are represented in terms of subproblems in a dual-decomposition framework that is optimized using subgradient techniques. The complete set of constraints we consider enforces cycle consistency over the original graph. In practice we find that the method converges quickly on most problems with the addition of a few subproblems and outperforms existing methods for some interesting classes of hard potentials.

1504.05392v1	In the presence of weak overall correlation, it may be useful to investigate if the correlation is significantly and substantially more pronounced over a subpopulation. Two different testing procedures are compared. Both are based on the rankings of the values of two variables from a data set with a large number n of observations. The first maintains its level against Gaussian copulas; the second adapts to general alternatives in the sense that that the number of parameters used in the test grows with n. An analysis of wine quality illustrates how the methods detect heterogeneity of association between chemical properties of the wine, which are attributable to a mix of different cultivars.	Nonparametric Testing for Heterogeneous Correlation
1102.5171v1	We present two Bayesian procedures to infer the interactions and external currents in an assembly of stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons from the recording of their spiking activity. The first procedure is based on the exact calculation of the most likely time courses of the neuron membrane potentials conditioned by the recorded spikes, and is exact for a vanishing noise variance and for an instantaneous synaptic integration. The second procedure takes into account the presence of fluctuations around the most likely time courses of the potentials, and can deal with moderate noise levels. The running time of both procedures is proportional to the number S of spikes multiplied by the squared number N of neurons. The algorithms are validated on synthetic data generated by networks with known couplings and currents. We also reanalyze previously published recordings of the activity of the salamander retina (including from 32 to 40 neurons, and from 65,000 to 170,000 spikes). We study the dependence of the inferred interactions on the membrane leaking time; the differences and similarities with the classical cross-correlation analysis are discussed.

1509.04610v2	We propose Macau, a powerful and flexible Bayesian factorization method for heterogeneous data. Our model can factorize any set of entities and relations that can be represented by a relational model, including tensors and also multiple relations for each entity. Macau can also incorporate side information, specifically entity and relation features, which are crucial for predicting sparsely observed relations. Macau scales to millions of entity instances, hundred millions of observations, and sparse entity features with millions of dimensions. To achieve the scale up, we specially designed sampling procedure for entity and relation features that relies primarily on noise injection in linear regressions. We show performance and advanced features of Macau in a set of experiments, including challenging drug-protein activity prediction task.	Macau: Scalable Bayesian Multi-relational Factorization with Side  Information using MCMC
0711.4983v1	Bayesian classification and regression with high order interactions is largely infeasible because Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) would need to be applied with a great many parameters, whose number increases rapidly with the order. In this paper we show how to make it feasible by effectively reducing the number of parameters, exploiting the fact that many interactions have the same values for all training cases. Our method uses a single ``compressed'' parameter to represent the sum of all parameters associated with a set of patterns that have the same value for all training cases. Using symmetric stable distributions as the priors of the original parameters, we can easily find the priors of these compressed parameters. We therefore need to deal only with a much smaller number of compressed parameters when training the model with MCMC. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. After training the model, we can split these compressed parameters into the original ones as needed to make predictions for test cases. We show in detail how to compress parameters for logistic sequence prediction models. Experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate that a huge number of parameters can indeed be reduced by our compression method.	A Method for Compressing Parameters in Bayesian Models with Application  to Logistic Sequence Prediction Models
1707.05712v1	We provide two main contributions in PAC-Bayesian theory for domain adaptation where the objective is to learn, from a source distribution, a well-performing majority vote on a different, but related, target distribution. Firstly, we propose an improvement of the previous approach we proposed in Germain et al. (2013), which relies on a novel distribution pseudodistance based on a disagreement averaging, allowing us to derive a new tighter domain adaptation bound for the target risk. While this bound stands in the spirit of common domain adaptation works, we derive a second bound (recently introduced in Germain et al., 2016) that brings a new perspective on domain adaptation by deriving an upper bound on the target risk where the distributions' divergence-expressed as a ratio-controls the trade-off between a source error measure and the target voters' disagreement. We discuss and compare both results, from which we obtain PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. Furthermore, from the PAC-Bayesian specialization to linear classifiers, we infer two learning algorithms, and we evaluate them on real data.	PAC-Bayes and Domain Adaptation
1703.04832v1	The goal of data clustering is to partition data points into groups to minimize a given objective function. While most existing clustering algorithms treat each data point as vector, in many applications each datum is not a vector but a point pattern or a set of points. Moreover, many existing clustering methods require the user to specify the number of clusters, which is not available in advance. This paper proposes a new class of models for data clustering that addresses set-valued data as well as unknown number of clusters, using a Dirichlet Process mixture of Poisson random finite sets. We also develop an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior inference technique that can learn the number of clusters and mixture parameters automatically from the data. Numerical studies are presented to demonstrate the salient features of this new model, in particular its capacity to discover extremely unbalanced clusters in data.	A Random Finite Set Model for Data Clustering
1706.01825v1	Chemical space is so large that brute force searches for new interesting molecules are infeasible. High-throughput virtual screening via computer cluster simulations can speed up the discovery process by collecting very large amounts of data in parallel, e.g., up to hundreds or thousands of parallel measurements. Bayesian optimization (BO) can produce additional acceleration by sequentially identifying the most useful simulations or experiments to be performed next. However, current BO methods cannot scale to the large numbers of parallel measurements and the massive libraries of molecules currently used in high-throughput screening. Here, we propose a scalable solution based on a parallel and distributed implementation of Thompson sampling (PDTS). We show that, in small scale problems, PDTS performs similarly as parallel expected improvement (EI), a batch version of the most widely used BO heuristic. Additionally, in settings where parallel EI does not scale, PDTS outperforms other scalable baselines such as a greedy search, $\epsilon$-greedy approaches and a random search method. These results show that PDTS is a successful solution for large-scale parallel BO.	Parallel and Distributed Thompson Sampling for Large-scale Accelerated  Exploration of Chemical Space
1308.1196v2	We introduce an application of the group lasso to design of experiments. Note that we are NOT trying to explain experimental design for the group lasso. Conversely, we explain how we can use the idea of the group lasso in experimental design, showing that the problem of constructing an optimal design matrix can be transformed into a problem of the group lasso. In some numerical examples, we show that we can obtain the orthogonal arrays as the solutions of the group lasso problems.	The Group Lasso for Design of Experiments
1507.05253v2	Many modern data analysis problems involve inferences from streaming data. However, streaming data is not easily amenable to the standard probabilistic modeling approaches, which assume that we condition on finite data. We develop population variational Bayes, a new approach for using Bayesian modeling to analyze streams of data. It approximates a new type of distribution, the population posterior, which combines the notion of a population distribution of the data with Bayesian inference in a probabilistic model. We study our method with latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixtures on several large-scale data sets.	The Population Posterior and Bayesian Inference on Streams
1410.3192v1	We study prediction and estimation problems using empirical risk minimization, relative to a general convex loss function. We obtain sharp error rates even when concentration is false or is very restricted, for example, in heavy-tailed scenarios. Our results show that the error rate depends on two parameters: one captures the intrinsic complexity of the class, and essentially leads to the error rate in a noise-free (or realizable) problem; the other measures interactions between class members the target and the loss, and is dominant when the problem is far from realizable. We also explain how one may deal with outliers by choosing the loss in a way that is calibrated to the intrinsic complexity of the class and to the noise-level of the problem (the latter is measured by the distance between the target and the class).	Learning without Concentration for General Loss Functions
1610.04181v6	Sources of variability in experimentally derived data include measurement error in addition to the physical phenomena of interest. This measurement error is a combination of systematic components, originating from the measuring instrument, and random measurement errors. Several novel biological technologies, such as mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq, are plagued with systematic errors that may severely affect statistical analysis if the data is not properly calibrated. We propose a novel deep learning approach for removing systematic batch effects. Our method is based on a residual network, trained to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the multivariate distributions of two replicates, measured in different batches. We apply our method to mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and demonstrate that it effectively attenuates batch effects.

1310.5438v3	The article describe the model, derivation, and implementation of variational Bayesian inference for linear and logistic regression, both with and without automatic relevance determination. It has the dual function of acting as a tutorial for the derivation of variational Bayesian inference for simple models, as well as documenting, and providing brief examples for the MATLAB functions that implement this inference. These functions are freely available online.	Variational Bayesian inference for linear and logistic regression
1011.5096v1	Phylogenetic tree reconstruction is traditionally based on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and heavily depends on the validity of this information bottleneck. With increasing sequence divergence, the quality of MSAs decays quickly. Alignment-free methods, on the other hand, are based on abstract string comparisons and avoid potential alignment problems. However, in general they are not biologically motivated and ignore our knowledge about the evolution of sequences. Thus, it is still a major open question how to define an evolutionary distance metric between divergent sequences that makes use of indel information and known substitution models without the need for a multiple alignment. Here we propose a new evolutionary distance metric to close this gap. It uses finite-state transducers to create a biologically motivated similarity score which models substitutions and indels, and does not depend on a multiple sequence alignment. The sequence similarity score is defined in analogy to pairwise alignments and additionally has the positive semi-definite property. We describe its derivation and show in simulation studies and real-world examples that it is more accurate in reconstructing phylogenies than competing methods. The result is a new and accurate way of determining evolutionary distances in and beyond the twilight zone of sequence alignments that is suitable for large datasets.	Evolutionary distances in the twilight zone -- a rational kernel  approach
1404.1361v3	We propose a method for inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a high-dimensional Gaussian vector time series (discrete-time process) from a finite-length observation. By contrast to existing approaches, we do not rely on a parametric process model (such as, e.g., an autoregressive model) for the observed random process. Instead, we only require certain smoothness properties (in the Fourier domain) of the process. The proposed inference scheme works even for sample sizes much smaller than the number of scalar process components if the true underlying CIG is sufficiently sparse. A theoretical performance analysis provides conditions which guarantee that the probability of the proposed inference method to deliver a wrong CIG is below a prescribed value. These conditions imply lower bounds on the sample size such that the new method is consistent asymptotically. Some numerical experiments validate our theoretical performance analysis and demonstrate superior performance of our scheme compared to an existing (parametric) approach in case of model mismatch.	Learning the Conditional Independence Structure of Stationary Time  Series: A Multitask Learning Approach
0912.3301v1	We study losses for binary classification and class probability estimation and extend the understanding of them from margin losses to general composite losses which are the composition of a proper loss with a link function. We characterise when margin losses can be proper composite losses, explicitly show how to determine a symmetric loss in full from half of one of its partial losses, introduce an intrinsic parametrisation of composite binary losses and give a complete characterisation of the relationship between proper losses and ``classification calibrated'' losses. We also consider the question of the ``best'' surrogate binary loss. We introduce a precise notion of ``best'' and show there exist situations where two convex surrogate losses are incommensurable. We provide a complete explicit characterisation of the convexity of composite binary losses in terms of the link function and the weight function associated with the proper loss which make up the composite loss. This characterisation suggests new ways of ``surrogate tuning''. Finally, in an appendix we present some new algorithm-independent results on the relationship between properness, convexity and robustness to misclassification noise for binary losses and show that all convex proper losses are non-robust to misclassification noise.	Composite Binary Losses
1706.03779v1	Latent feature modeling allows capturing the latent structure responsible for generating the observed properties of a set of objects. It is often used to make predictions either for new values of interest or missing information in the original data, as well as to perform data exploratory analysis. However, although there is an extensive literature on latent feature models for homogeneous datasets, where all the attributes that describe each object are of the same (continuous or discrete) nature, there is a lack of work on latent feature modeling for heterogeneous databases. In this paper, we introduce a general Bayesian nonparametric latent feature model suitable for heterogeneous datasets, where the attributes describing each object can be either discrete, continuous or mixed variables. The proposed model presents several important properties. First, it accounts for heterogeneous data while keeping the properties of conjugate models, which allow us to infer the model in linear time with respect to the number of objects and attributes. Second, its Bayesian nonparametric nature allows us to automatically infer the model complexity from the data, i.e., the number of features necessary to capture the latent structure in the data. Third, the latent features in the model are binary-valued variables, easing the interpretability of the obtained latent features in data exploratory analysis. We show the flexibility of the proposed model by solving both prediction and data analysis tasks on several real-world datasets. Moreover, a software package of the GLFM is publicly available for other researcher to use and improve it.	General Latent Feature Models for Heterogeneous Datasets
1705.07654v1	Various problems in data analysis and statistical genetics call for recovery of a column-sparse, low-rank matrix from noisy observations. We propose ReFACTor, a simple variation of the classical Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) algorithm. In contrast to previous sparse principal component analysis (PCA) algorithms, our algorithm can provably reveal a low-rank signal matrix better, and often significantly better, than the widely used TSVD, making it the algorithm of choice whenever column-sparsity is suspected. Empirically, we observe that ReFACTor consistently outperforms TSVD even when the underlying signal is not sparse, suggesting that it is generally safe to use ReFACTor instead of TSVD and PCA. The algorithm is extremely simple to implement and its running time is dominated by the runtime of PCA, making it as practical as standard principal component analysis.

1605.03267v2	We present a new method for estimating multivariate, second-order stationary Gaussian Random Field (GRF) models based on the Sparse Precision matrix Selection (SPS) algorithm, proposed by Davanloo et al. (2015) for estimating scalar GRF models. Theoretical convergence rates for the estimated between-response covariance matrix and for the estimated parameters of the underlying spatial correlation function are established. Numerical tests using simulated and real datasets validate our theoretical findings. Data segmentation is used to handle large data sets.	Generalized Sparse Precision Matrix Selection for Fitting Multivariate  Gaussian Random Fields to Large Data Sets
1412.8724v2	We propose a robust inferential procedure for assessing uncertainties of parameter estimation in high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension $p$ can grow exponentially fast with the sample size $n$. Our method combines the de-biasing technique with the composite quantile function to construct an estimator that is asymptotically normal. Hence it can be used to construct valid confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. Our estimator is robust and does not require the existence of first or second moment of the noise distribution. It also preserves efficiency in the sense that the worst case efficiency loss is less than 30\% compared to the square-loss-based de-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better than the latter, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Our de-biasing procedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized composite quantile regression. Instead, it allows for any first-stage estimator with desired convergence rate and empirical sparsity. The paper also provides new proof techniques for developing theoretical guarantees of inferential procedures with non-smooth loss functions. To establish the main results, we exploit the local curvature of the conditional expectation of composite quantile loss and apply empirical process theories to control the difference between empirical quantities and their conditional expectations. Our results are established under weaker assumptions compared to existing work on inference for high-dimensional quantile regression. Furthermore, we consider a high-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameters by applying the Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. We also study distributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce computation complexity when the sample size is massive. Finally, we provide empirical results to verify the theory.	A General Framework for Robust Testing and Confidence Regions in  High-Dimensional Quantile Regression
0706.3188v1	"Conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of confidence in new predictions. Given an error probability $\epsilon$, together with a method that makes a prediction $\hat{y}$ of a label $y$, it produces a set of labels, typically containing $\hat{y}$, that also contains $y$ with probability $1-\epsilon$. Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for producing $\hat{y}$: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector machine, ridge regression, etc. Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted. The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then the successive predictions will be right $1-\epsilon$ of the time, even though they are based on an accumulating dataset rather than on independent datasets. In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these. This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal prediction and works through several numerical examples. A more comprehensive treatment of the topic is provided in ""Algorithmic Learning in a Random World"", by Vladimir Vovk, Alex Gammerman, and Glenn Shafer (Springer, 2005)."

1701.02967v1	In this article, a large dimensional performance analysis of kernel least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is provided under the assumption of a two-class Gaussian mixture model for the input data. Building upon recent random matrix advances, when both the dimension of data $p$ and their number $n$ grow large at the same rate, we show that the LS-SVM decision function converges to a normal-distributed variable, the mean and variance of which depend explicitly on a local behavior of the kernel function. This theoretical result is then applied to the MNIST data sets which, despite their non-Gaussianity, exhibit a surprisingly similar behavior. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the mechanism into play in SVM-type methods and in particular of the impact on the choice of the kernel function as well as some of their theoretical limits.

1011.1379v1	Hutter (2007) recently introduced the loss rank principle (LoRP) as a generalpurpose principle for model selection. The LoRP enjoys many attractive properties and deserves further investigations. The LoRP has been well-studied for regression framework in Hutter and Tran (2010). In this paper, we study the LoRP for classification framework, and develop it further for model selection problems in unsupervised learning where the main interest is to describe the associations between input measurements, like cluster analysis or graphical modelling. Theoretical properties and simulation studies are presented.	Model Selection by Loss Rank for Classification and Unsupervised  Learning
1209.3230v1	In the paper, we consider the problem of link prediction in time-evolving graphs. We assume that certain graph features, such as the node degree, follow a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and we propose to use this information to improve the accuracy of prediction. Our strategy involves a joint optimization procedure over the space of adjacency matrices and VAR matrices which takes into account both sparsity and low rank properties of the matrices. Oracle inequalities are derived and illustrate the trade-offs in the choice of smoothing parameters when modeling the joint effect of sparsity and low rank property. The estimate is computed efficiently using proximal methods through a generalized forward-backward agorithm.	Link Prediction in Graphs with Autoregressive Features
1703.04778v1	We propose a probabilistic model to aggregate the answers of respondents answering multiple-choice questions. The model does not assume that everyone has access to the same information, and so does not assume that the consensus answer is correct. Instead, it infers the most probable world state, even if only a minority vote for it. Each respondent is modeled as receiving a signal contingent on the actual world state, and as using this signal to both determine their own answer and predict the answers given by others. By incorporating respondent's predictions of others' answers, the model infers latent parameters corresponding to the prior over world states and the probability of different signals being received in all possible world states, including counterfactual ones. Unlike other probabilistic models for aggregation, our model applies to both single and multiple questions, in which case it estimates each respondent's expertise. The model shows good performance, compared to a number of other probabilistic models, on data from seven studies covering different types of expertise.

1111.6925v1	Probabilistic graphical models combine the graph theory and probability theory to give a multivariate statistical modeling. They provide a unified description of uncertainty using probability and complexity using the graphical model. Especially, graphical models provide the following several useful properties: - Graphical models provide a simple and intuitive interpretation of the structures of probabilistic models. On the other hand, they can be used to design and motivate new models. - Graphical models provide additional insights into the properties of the model, including the conditional independence properties. - Complex computations which are required to perform inference and learning in sophisticated models can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which the underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly. The graphical models have been applied to a large number of fields, including bioinformatics, social science, control theory, image processing, marketing analysis, among others. However, structure learning for graphical models remains an open challenge, since one must cope with a combinatorial search over the space of all possible structures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing structure learning algorithms.	Structure Learning of Probabilistic Graphical Models: A Comprehensive  Survey
1509.02347v1	In this paper, we focus on the stochastic block model (SBM),a probabilistic tool describing interactions between nodes of a network using latent clusters. The SBM assumes that the networkhas a stationary structure, in which connections of time varying intensity are not taken into account. In other words, interactions between two groups are forced to have the same features during the whole observation time. To overcome this limitation,we propose a partition of the whole time horizon, in which interactions are observed, and develop a non stationary extension of the SBM,allowing to simultaneously cluster the nodes in a network along with fixed time intervals in which the interactions take place. The number of clusters (K for nodes, D for time intervals) as well as the class memberships are finallyobtained through maximizing the complete-data integrated likelihood by means of a greedy search approach. After showing that the model works properly with simulated data, we focus on a real data set. We thus consider the three days ACM Hypertext conference held in Turin,June 29th - July 1st 2009. Proximity interactions between attendees during the first day are modelled and an interestingclustering of the daily hours is finally obtained, with times of social gathering (e.g. coffee breaks) recovered by the approach. Applications to large networks are limited due to the computational complexity of the greedy search which is dominated bythe number $K\_{max}$ and $D\_{max}$ of clusters used in the initialization. Therefore,advanced clustering tools are considered to reduce the number of clusters expected in the data, making the greedy search applicable to large networks.

1105.0167v3	We propose a general information-theoretic approach called Seraph (SEmi-supervised metRic leArning Paradigm with Hyper-sparsity) for metric learning that does not rely upon the manifold assumption. Given the probability parameterized by a Mahalanobis distance, we maximize the entropy of that probability on labeled data and minimize it on unlabeled data following entropy regularization, which allows the supervised and unsupervised parts to be integrated in a natural and meaningful way. Furthermore, Seraph is regularized by encouraging a low-rank projection induced from the metric. The optimization of Seraph is solved efficiently and stably by an EM-like scheme with the analytical E-Step and convex M-Step. Experiments demonstrate that Seraph compares favorably with many well-known global and local metric learning methods.	SERAPH: Semi-supervised Metric Learning Paradigm with Hyper Sparsity
1302.6766v3	This work develops a generic framework, called the bag-of-paths (BoP), for link and network data analysis. The central idea is to assign a probability distribution on the set of all paths in a network. More precisely, a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution is defined over a bag of paths in a network, that is, on a representation that considers all paths independently. We show that, under this distribution, the probability of drawing a path connecting two nodes can easily be computed in closed form by simple matrix inversion. This probability captures a notion of relatedness between nodes of the graph: two nodes are considered as highly related when they are connected by many, preferably low-cost, paths. As an application, two families of distances between nodes are derived from the BoP probabilities. Interestingly, the second distance family interpolates between the shortest path distance and the resistance distance. In addition, it extends the Bellman-Ford formula for computing the shortest path distance in order to integrate sub-optimal paths by simply replacing the minimum operator by the soft minimum operator. Experimental results on semi-supervised classification show that both of the new distance families are competitive with other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition to the distance measures studied in this paper, the bag-of-paths framework enables straightforward computation of many other relevant network measures.

1610.01766v2	Constrained adaptive filtering algorithms inculding constrained least mean square (CLMS), constrained affine projection (CAP) and constrained recursive least squares (CRLS) have been extensively studied in many applications. Most existing constrained adaptive filtering algorithms are developed under mean square error (MSE) criterion, which is an ideal optimality criterion under Gaussian noises. This assumption however fails to model the behavior of non-Gaussian noises found in practice. Motivated by the robustness and simplicity of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) in non-Gaussian impulsive noises, this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering algorithm called constrained maximum correntropy criterion (CMCC). Specifically, CMCC incorporates a linear constraint into a MCC filter to solve a constrained optimization problem explicitly. The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm is easy to implement and has low computational complexity, and in terms of convergence accuracy (say lower mean square deviation) and stability, can significantly outperform those MSE based constrained adaptive algorithms in presence of heavy-tailed impulsive noises. Additionally, the mean square convergence behaviors are studied under energy conservation relation, and a sufficient condition to ensure the mean square convergence and the steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) of the proposed algorithm are obtained. Simulation results confirm the theoretical predictions under both Gaussian and non- Gaussian noises, and demonstrate the excellent performance of the novel algorithm by comparing it with other conventional methods.	Constrained Maximum Correntropy Adaptive Filtering
1610.05163v1	Quantitative modeling of post-transcriptional regulation process is a challenging problem in systems biology. A mechanical model of the regulatory process needs to be able to describe the available spatio-temporal protein concentration and mRNA expression data and recover the continuous spatio-temporal fields. Rigorous methods are required to identify model parameters. A promising approach to deal with these difficulties is proposed using Gaussian process as a prior distribution over the latent function of protein concentration and mRNA expression. In this study, we consider a partial differential equation mechanical model with differential operators and latent function. Since the operators at stake are linear, the information from the physical model can be encoded into the kernel function. Hybrid Monte Carlo methods are employed to carry out Bayesian inference of the partial differential equation parameters and Gaussian process kernel parameters. The spatio-temporal field of protein concentration and mRNA expression are reconstructed without explicitly solving the partial differential equation.

In this paper we describe the constrained mixture model, based on a mixture of Gamma and Gaussian distributions, to provide an accurate description of price trends as being clearly positive, negative or ranging while accounting for heavy tails and high kurtosis. The model is estimated in the Expectation Maximisation framework and model order estimation also respects the model's constraints.	Constrained Mixture Models for Asset Returns Modelling
1702.04775v2	Many modern data sets are sampled with error from complex high-dimensional surfaces. Methods such as tensor product splines or Gaussian processes are effective/well suited for characterizing a surface in two or three dimensions but may suffer from difficulties when representing higher dimensional surfaces. Motivated by high throughput toxicity testing where observed dose-response curves are cross sections of a surface defined by a chemical's structural properties, a model is developed to characterize this surface to predict untested chemicals' dose-responses. This manuscript proposes a novel approach that models the multidimensional surface as a sum of learned basis functions formed as the tensor product of lower dimensional functions, which are themselves representable by a basis expansion learned from the data. The model is described, a Gibbs sampling algorithm proposed, and is investigated in a simulation study as well as data taken from the US EPA's ToxCast high throughput toxicity testing platform.

1509.02866v2	We propose a second-order (Hessian or Hessian-free) based optimization method for variational inference inspired by Gaussian backpropagation, and argue that quasi-Newton optimization can be developed as well. This is accomplished by generalizing the gradient computation in stochastic backpropagation via a reparametrization trick with lower complexity. As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to the problems of Bayesian logistic regression and variational auto-encoder (VAE). Additionally, we compute bounds on the estimator variance of intractable expectations for the family of Lipschitz continuous function. Our method is practical, scalable and model free. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets and provide comparisons with other stochastic gradient methods to show substantial enhancement in convergence rates.

1310.0512v2	In standard clustering problems, data points are represented by vectors, and by stacking them together, one forms a data matrix with row or column cluster structure. In this paper, we consider a class of binary matrices, arising in many applications, which exhibit both row and column cluster structure, and our goal is to exactly recover the underlying row and column clusters by observing only a small fraction of noisy entries. We first derive a lower bound on the minimum number of observations needed for exact cluster recovery. Then, we propose three algorithms with different running time and compare the number of observations needed by them for successful cluster recovery. Our analytical results show smooth time-data trade-offs: one can gradually reduce the computational complexity when increasingly more observations are available.

1011.5133v1	In this article, we derive concentration inequalities for the cross-validation estimate of the generalization error for stable predictors in the context of risk assessment. The notion of stability has been first introduced by \cite{DEWA79} and extended by \cite{KEA95}, \cite{BE01} and \cite{KUNIY02} to characterize class of predictors with infinite VC dimension. In particular, this covers $k$-nearest neighbors rules, bayesian algorithm (\cite{KEA95}), boosting,... General loss functions and class of predictors are considered. We use the formalism introduced by \cite{DUD03} to cover a large variety of cross-validation procedures including leave-one-out cross-validation, $k$-fold cross-validation, hold-out cross-validation (or split sample), and the leave-$\upsilon$-out cross-validation. In particular, we give a simple rule on how to choose the cross-validation, depending on the stability of the class of predictors. In the special case of uniform stability, an interesting consequence is that the number of elements in the test set is not required to grow to infinity for the consistency of the cross-validation procedure. In this special case, the particular interest of leave-one-out cross-validation is emphasized.	Concentration inequalities of the cross-validation estimate for stable  predictors
1704.03651v1	Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged during the last few years as an effective approach to optimizing black-box functions where direct queries of the objective are expensive. In this paper we consider the case where direct access to the function is not possible, but information about user preferences is. Such scenarios arise in problems where human preferences are modeled, such as A/B tests or recommender systems. We present a new framework for this scenario that we call Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) which allows us to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be queried through pairwise comparisons, the so-called duels. PBO extends the applicability of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by modeling the probability of the winner of each duel by means of a Gaussian process model with a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO. We illustrate the benefits of PBO in a variety of experiments, showing that PBO needs drastically fewer comparisons for finding the optimum. According to our experiments, the way of modeling correlations in PBO is key in obtaining this advantage.	Preferential Bayesian Optimization
1202.6504v2	This paper presents a kernel-based discriminative learning framework on probability measures. Rather than relying on large collections of vectorial training examples, our framework learns using a collection of probability distributions that have been constructed to meaningfully represent training data. By representing these probability distributions as mean embeddings in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we are able to apply many standard kernel-based learning techniques in straightforward fashion. To accomplish this, we construct a generalization of the support vector machine (SVM) called a support measure machine (SMM). Our analyses of SMMs provides several insights into their relationship to traditional SVMs. Based on such insights, we propose a flexible SVM (Flex-SVM) that places different kernel functions on each training example. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.	Learning from Distributions via Support Measure Machines
1605.00316v1	"The modern data analyst must cope with data encoded in various forms, vectors, matrices, strings, graphs, or more. Consequently, statistical and machine learning models tailored to different data encodings are important. We focus on data encoded as normalized vectors, so that their ""direction"" is more important than their magnitude. Specifically, we consider high-dimensional vectors that lie either on the surface of the unit hypersphere or on the real projective plane. For such data, we briefly review common mathematical models prevalent in machine learning, while also outlining some technical aspects, software, applications, and open mathematical challenges."

1612.05519v2	Many popular network models rely on the assumption of (vertex) exchangeability, in which the distribution of the graph is invariant to relabelings of the vertices. However, the Aldous-Hoover theorem guarantees that these graphs are dense or empty with probability one, whereas many real-world graphs are sparse. We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure.

0711.2434v1	We characterize and study variable importance (VIMP) and pairwise variable associations in binary regression trees. A key component involves the node mean squared error for a quantity we refer to as a maximal subtree. The theory naturally extends from single trees to ensembles of trees and applies to methods like random forests. This is useful because while importance values from random forests are used to screen variables, for example they are used to filter high throughput genomic data in Bioinformatics, very little theory exists about their properties.

1602.03048v1	Unsupervised image segmentation aims at clustering the set of pixels of an image into spatially homogeneous regions. We introduce here a class of Bayesian nonparametric models to address this problem. These models are based on a combination of a Potts-like spatial smoothness component and a prior on partitions which is used to control both the number and size of clusters. This class of models is flexible enough to include the standard Potts model and the more recent Potts-Dirichlet Process model \cite{Orbanz2008}. More importantly, any prior on partitions can be introduced to control the global clustering structure so that it is possible to penalize small or large clusters if necessary. Bayesian computation is carried out using an original generalized Swendsen-Wang algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive in terms of RAND\ index compared to popular image segmentation methods, such as mean-shift, and recent alternative Bayesian nonparametric models.

1710.06818v1	Tensor decomposition methods are popular tools for learning latent variables given only lower-order moments of the data. However, the standard assumption is that we have sufficient data to estimate these moments to high accuracy. In this work, we consider the case in which certain dimensions of the data are not always observed---common in applied settings, where not all measurements may be taken for all observations---resulting in moment estimates of varying quality. We derive a weighted tensor decomposition approach that is computationally as efficient as the non-weighted approach, and demonstrate that it outperforms methods that do not appropriately leverage these less-observed dimensions.

As a second application, we solve an open question linking batch learning and transductive online learning"	Efficient Transductive Online Learning via Randomized Rounding
1605.00388v2	Separating the short jobs from the long is a known technique to improve scheduling performance. In this paper we describe a method we developed for accurately predicting the runtimes classes of the jobs to enable this separation. Our method uses the fact that the runtimes can be represented as a mixture of overlapping Gaussian distributions, in order to train a CART classifier to provide the prediction. The threshold that separates the short jobs from the long jobs is determined during the evaluation of the classifier to maximize prediction accuracy. Our results indicate overall accuracy of 90% for the data set used in our study, with sensitivity and specificity both above 90%.	Highly Accurate Prediction of Jobs Runtime Classes
1606.00832v1	We propose a nonconvex estimator for joint multivariate regression and precision matrix estimation in the high dimensional regime, under sparsity constraints. A gradient descent algorithm with hard thresholding is developed to solve the nonconvex estimator, and it attains a linear rate of convergence to the true regression coefficients and precision matrix simultaneously, up to the statistical error. Compared with existing methods along this line of research, which have little theoretical guarantee, the proposed algorithm not only is computationally much more efficient with provable convergence guarantee, but also attains the optimal finite sample statistical rate up to a logarithmic factor. Thorough experiments on both synthetic and real datasets back up our theory.	High Dimensional Multivariate Regression and Precision Matrix Estimation  via Nonconvex Optimization
1710.01167v1	Many machine learning problems can be characterized by mutual contamination models. In these problems, one observes several random samples from different convex combinations of a set of unknown base distributions and the goal is to infer these base distributions. This paper considers the general setting where the base distributions are defined on arbitrary probability spaces. We examine three popular machine learning problems that arise in this general setting: multiclass classification with label noise, demixing of mixed membership models, and classification with partial labels. In each case, we give sufficient conditions for identifiability and present algorithms for the infinite and finite sample settings, with associated performance guarantees.

1508.01717v4	We consider the problem of structure learning for bow-free acyclic path diagrams (BAPs). BAPs can be viewed as a generalization of linear Gaussian DAG models that allow for certain hidden variables. We present a first method for this problem using a greedy score-based search algorithm. We also prove some necessary and some sufficient conditions for distributional equivalence of BAPs which are used in an algorithmic ap- proach to compute (nearly) equivalent model structures. This allows us to infer lower bounds of causal effects. We also present applications to real and simulated datasets using our publicly available R-package.

1602.03442v2	Recently, Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods have been proposed for scaling up Monte Carlo computations to large data problems. Whilst these approaches have proven useful in many applications, vanilla SG-MCMC might suffer from poor mixing rates when random variables exhibit strong couplings under the target densities or big scale differences. In this study, we propose a novel SG-MCMC method that takes the local geometry into account by using ideas from Quasi-Newton optimization methods. These second order methods directly approximate the inverse Hessian by using a limited history of samples and their gradients. Our method uses dense approximations of the inverse Hessian while keeping the time and memory complexities linear with the dimension of the problem. We provide a formal theoretical analysis where we show that the proposed method is asymptotically unbiased and consistent with the posterior expectations. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach on both synthetic and real datasets. Our experiments on two challenging applications show that our method achieves fast convergence rates similar to Riemannian approaches while at the same time having low computational requirements similar to diagonal preconditioning approaches.

1507.08272v1	This work introduces algorithms able to exploit contextual information in order to improve maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimation in finite mixture models (FMM), demonstrating their benefits and properties in several scenarios. The proposed algorithms are derived in a probabilistic framework with regard to situations where the regular FMM graphs can be extended with context-related variables, respecting the standard expectation-maximization (EM) methodology and, thus, rendering explicit supervision completely redundant. We show that, by direct application of the missing information principle, the compared algorithms' learning behaviour operates between the extremities of supervised and unsupervised learning, proportionally to the information content of contextual assistance. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of context-aware FMM training as compared to conventional unsupervised training in terms of estimation precision, standard errors, convergence rates and classification accuracy or regression fitness in various scenarios, while also highlighting important differences among the outlined situations. Finally, the improved classification outcome of contextually enhanced FMMs is showcased in a brain-computer interface application scenario.	Context-aware learning for finite mixture models
1202.4184v1	Randomized algorithms that base iteration-level decisions on samples from some pool are ubiquitous in machine learning and optimization. Examples include stochastic gradient descent and randomized coordinate descent. This paper makes progress at theoretically evaluating the difference in performance between sampling with- and without-replacement in such algorithms. Focusing on least means squares optimization, we formulate a noncommutative arithmetic-geometric mean inequality that would prove that the expected convergence rate of without-replacement sampling is faster than that of with-replacement sampling. We demonstrate that this inequality holds for many classes of random matrices and for some pathological examples as well. We provide a deterministic worst-case bound on the gap between the discrepancy between the two sampling models, and explore some of the impediments to proving this inequality in full generality. We detail the consequences of this inequality for stochastic gradient descent and the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving linear systems.

1802.07528v1	We present a new Gaussian process (GP) regression model where the covariance kernel is indexed or parameterized by a sufficient dimension reduction subspace of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The covariance kernel will be low-rank while capturing the statistical dependency of the response to the covariates, this affords significant improvement in computational efficiency as well as potential reduction in the variance of predictions. We develop a fast Expectation-Maximization algorithm for estimating the parameters of the subspace-induced Gaussian process (SIGP). Extensive results on real data show that SIGP can outperform the standard full GP even with a low rank-$m$, $m\leq 3$, inducing subspace.	Subspace-Induced Gaussian Processes
1703.01925v1	Deep generative models have been wildly successful at learning coherent latent representations for continuous data such as video and audio. However, generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions and molecular structures still poses significant challenges. Crucially, state-of-the-art methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which encodes and decodes directly to and from these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always valid. Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs, it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and molecular synthesis.	Grammar Variational Autoencoder
0912.0171v2	This article addresses the modeling of reverberant recording environments in the context of under-determined convolutive blind source separation. We model the contribution of each source to all mixture channels in the time-frequency domain as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable whose covariance encodes the spatial characteristics of the source. We then consider four specific covariance models, including a full-rank unconstrained model. We derive a family of iterative expectationmaximization (EM) algorithms to estimate the parameters of each model and propose suitable procedures to initialize the parameters and to align the order of the estimated sources across all frequency bins based on their estimated directions of arrival (DOA). Experimental results over reverberant synthetic mixtures and live recordings of speech data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

1505.04413v2	In a range of fields including the geosciences, molecular biology, robotics and computer vision, one encounters problems that involve random variables on manifolds. Currently, there is a lack of flexible probabilistic models on manifolds that are fast and easy to train. We define an extremely flexible class of exponential family distributions on manifolds such as the torus, sphere, and rotation groups, and show that for these distributions the gradient of the log-likelihood can be computed efficiently using a non-commutative generalization of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We discuss applications to Bayesian camera motion estimation (where harmonic exponential families serve as conjugate priors), and modelling of the spatial distribution of earthquakes on the surface of the earth. Our experimental results show that harmonic densities yield a significantly higher likelihood than the best competing method, while being orders of magnitude faster to train.

1107.1805v1	We consider the problem of training probabilistic conditional random fields (CRFs) in the context of a task where performance is measured using a specific loss function. While maximum likelihood is the most common approach to training CRFs, it ignores the inherent structure of the task's loss function. We describe alternatives to maximum likelihood which take that loss into account. These include a novel adaptation of a loss upper bound from the structured SVMs literature to the CRF context, as well as a new loss-inspired KL divergence objective which relies on the probabilistic nature of CRFs. These loss-sensitive objectives are compared to maximum likelihood using ranking as a benchmark task. This comparison confirms the importance of incorporating loss information in the probabilistic training of CRFs, with the loss-inspired KL outperforming all other objectives.

1504.02723v4	We consider the inference of the structure of an undirected graphical model in an exact Bayesian framework. More specifically we aim at achieving the inference with close-form posteriors, avoiding any sampling step. This task would be intractable without any restriction on the considered graphs, so we limit our exploration to mixtures of spanning trees. We consider the inference of the structure of an undirected graphical model in a Bayesian framework. To avoid convergence issues and highly demanding Monte Carlo sampling, we focus on exact inference. More specifically we aim at achieving the inference with close-form posteriors, avoiding any sampling step. To this aim, we restrict the set of considered graphs to mixtures of spanning trees. We investigate under which conditions on the priors - on both tree structures and parameters - exact Bayesian inference can be achieved. Under these conditions, we derive a fast an exact algorithm to compute the posterior probability for an edge to belong to {the tree model} using an algebraic result called the Matrix-Tree theorem. We show that the assumption we have made does not prevent our approach to perform well on synthetic and flow cytometry data.

1704.07520v2	Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that iteratively transports a set of particles to approximate given distributions, based on an efficient gradient-based update that guarantees to optimally decrease the KL divergence within a function space. This paper develops the first theoretical analysis on SVGD, discussing its weak convergence properties and showing that its asymptotic behavior is captured by a gradient flow of the KL divergence functional under a new metric structure induced by Stein operator. We also provide a number of results on Stein operator and Stein's identity using the notion of weak derivative, including a new proof of the distinguishability of Stein discrepancy under weak conditions.

The package provides tools for selecting trees, forests and decomposable models minimizing information criteria such as AIC or BIC, and for displaying the independence graphs of the models. It has also some useful tools for analysing graphical structures. It supports the use of discrete, continuous, or both types of variables simultaneously.

1410.6791v4	We introduce the Locally Linear Latent Variable Model (LL-LVM), a probabilistic model for non-linear manifold discovery that describes a joint distribution over observations, their manifold coordinates and locally linear maps conditioned on a set of neighbourhood relationships. The model allows straightforward variational optimisation of the posterior distribution on coordinates and locally linear maps from the latent space to the observation space given the data. Thus, the LL-LVM encapsulates the local-geometry preserving intuitions that underlie non-probabilistic methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE). Its probabilistic semantics make it easy to evaluate the quality of hypothesised neighbourhood relationships, select the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold, construct out-of-sample extensions and to combine the manifold model with additional probabilistic models that capture the structure of coordinates within the manifold.

1408.3378v2	We define the beta diffusion tree, a random tree structure with a set of leaves that defines a collection of overlapping subsets of objects, known as a feature allocation. A generative process for the tree structure is defined in terms of particles (representing the objects) diffusing in some continuous space, analogously to the Dirichlet diffusion tree (Neal, 2003), which defines a tree structure over partitions (i.e., non-overlapping subsets) of the objects. Unlike in the Dirichlet diffusion tree, multiple copies of a particle may exist and diffuse along multiple branches in the beta diffusion tree, and an object may therefore belong to multiple subsets of particles. We demonstrate how to build a hierarchically-clustered factor analysis model with the beta diffusion tree and how to perform inference over the random tree structures with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We conclude with several numerical experiments on missing data problems with data sets of gene expression microarrays, international development statistics, and intranational socioeconomic measurements.

1109.1032v1	"The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a generative model that treats sequential data under the assumption that each observation is conditioned on the state of a discrete hidden variable that evolves in time as a Markov chain. In this paper, we derive a novel algorithm to cluster HMMs through their probability distributions. We propose a hierarchical EM algorithm that i) clusters a given collection of HMMs into groups of HMMs that are similar, in terms of the distributions they represent, and ii) characterizes each group by a ""cluster center"", i.e., a novel HMM that is representative for the group. We present several empirical studies that illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm."	Tech Report A Variational HEM Algorithm for Clustering Hidden Markov  Models
1203.1078v2	"In computer experiments, a mathematical model implemented on a computer is used to represent complex physical phenomena. These models, known as computer simulators, enable experimental study of a virtual representation of the complex phenomena. Simulators can be thought of as complex functions that take many inputs and provide an output. Often these simulators are themselves expensive to compute, and may be approximated by ""surrogate models"" such as statistical regression models. In this paper we consider a new kind of surrogate model, a Bayesian ensemble of trees (Chipman et al. 2010), with the specific goal of learning enough about the simulator that a particular feature of the simulator can be estimated. We focus on identifying the simulator's global minimum. Utilizing the Bayesian version of the Expected Improvement criterion (Jones et al. 1998), we show that this ensemble is particularly effective when the simulator is ill-behaved, exhibiting nonstationarity or abrupt changes in the response. A number of illustrations of the approach are given, including a tidal power application."	Sequential Design for Computer Experiments with a Flexible Bayesian  Additive Model
1201.0862v5	We examine the recovery of block sparse signals and extend the framework in two important directions; one by exploiting signals' intra-block correlation and the other by generalizing signals' block structure. We propose two families of algorithms based on the framework of block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL). One family, directly derived from the BSBL framework, requires knowledge of the block structure. Another family, derived from an expanded BSBL framework, is based on a weaker assumption on the block structure, and can be used when the block structure is completely unknown. Using these algorithms we show that exploiting intra-block correlation is very helpful in improving recovery performance. These algorithms also shed light on how to modify existing algorithms or design new ones to exploit such correlation and improve performance.

1207.4674v1	Case vs control comparisons have been the classical approach to the study of neurological diseases. However, most patients will not fall cleanly into either group. Instead, clinicians will typically find patients that cannot be classified as having clearly progressed into the disease state. For those subjects, very little can be said about their brain function on the basis of analyses of group differences. To describe the intermediate brain function requires models that interpolate between the disease states. We have chosen Gaussian Processes (GP) regression to obtain a continuous spectrum of brain activation and to extract the unknown disease progression profile. Our models incorporate spatial distribution of measures of activation, e.g. the correlation of an fMRI trace with an input stimulus, and so constitute ultra-high multi-variate GP regressors. We applied GPs to model fMRI image phenotypes across Alzheimer's Disease (AD) behavioural measures, e.g. MMSE, ACE etc. scores, and obtained predictions at non-observed MMSE/ACE values. The overall model confirmed the known reduction in the spatial extent of activity in response to reading versus false-font stimulation. The predictive uncertainty indicated the worsening confidence intervals at behavioural scores distance from those used for GP training. Thus, the model indicated the type of patient (what behavioural score) that would need to included in the training data to improve models predictions.	Models of Disease Spectra
0811.4208v1	Min-cut clustering, based on minimizing one of two heuristic cost-functions proposed by Shi and Malik, has spawned tremendous research, both analytic and algorithmic, in the graph partitioning and image segmentation communities over the last decade. It is however unclear if these heuristics can be derived from a more general principle facilitating generalization to new problem settings. Motivated by an existing graph partitioning framework, we derive relationships between optimizing relevance information, as defined in the Information Bottleneck method, and the regularized cut in a K-partitioned graph. For fast mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the location of random walkers on the graph. For graphs generated from a stochastic algorithm designed to model community structure, the optimal information theoretic partition and the optimal min-cut partition are shown to be the same with high probability.

1707.09752v2	Real data often contain anomalous cases, also known as outliers. These may spoil the resulting analysis but they may also contain valuable information. In either case, the ability to detect such anomalies is essential. A useful tool for this purpose is robust statistics, which aims to detect the outliers by first fitting the majority of the data and then flagging data points that deviate from it. We present an overview of several robust methods and the resulting graphical outlier detection tools. We discuss robust procedures for univariate, low-dimensional, and high-dimensional data, such as estimating location and scatter, linear regression, principal component analysis, classification, clustering, and functional data analysis. Also the challenging new topic of cellwise outliers is introduced.	Anomaly Detection by Robust Statistics
1603.00929v2	We apply a wild bootstrap method to the Lancaster three-variable interaction measure in order to detect factorisation of the joint distribution on three variables forming a stationary random process, for which the existing permutation bootstrap method fails. As in the i.i.d. case, the Lancaster test is found to outperform existing tests in cases for which two independent variables individually have a weak influence on a third, but that when considered jointly the influence is strong. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: first, we prove that the Lancaster statistic satisfies the conditions required to estimate the quantiles of the null distribution using the wild bootstrap; second, the manner in which this is proved is novel, simpler than existing methods, and can further be applied to other statistics.

1106.2436v3	"We consider an adversarial online learning setting where a decision maker can choose an action in every stage of the game. In addition to observing the reward of the chosen action, the decision maker gets side observations on the reward he would have obtained had he chosen some of the other actions. The observation structure is encoded as a graph, where node i is linked to node j if sampling i provides information on the reward of j. This setting naturally interpolates between the well-known ""experts"" setting, where the decision maker can view all rewards, and the multi-armed bandits setting, where the decision maker can only view the reward of the chosen action. We develop practical algorithms with provable regret guarantees, which depend on non-trivial graph-theoretic properties of the information feedback structure. We also provide partially-matching lower bounds."	From Bandits to Experts: On the Value of Side-Observations
0812.3201v1	Variable selection in high-dimensional space characterizes many contemporary problems in scientific discovery and decision making. Many frequently-used techniques are based on independence screening; examples include correlation ranking (Fan and Lv, 2008) or feature selection using a two-sample t-test in high-dimensional classification (Tibshirani et al., 2003). Within the context of the linear model, Fan and Lv (2008)showed that this simple correlation ranking possesses a sure independence screening property under certain conditions and that its revision, called iteratively sure independent screening (ISIS), is needed when the features are marginally unrelated but jointly related to the response variable. In this paper, we extend ISIS, without explicit definition of residuals, to a general pseudo-likelihood framework, which includes generalized linear models as a special case. Even in the least-squares setting, the new method improves ISIS by allowing variable deletion in the iterative process. Our technique allows us to select important features in high-dimensional classification where the popularly used two-sample t-method fails. A new technique is introduced to reduce the false discovery rate in the feature screening stage. Several simulated and two real data examples are presented to illustrate the methodology.	Ultrahigh dimensional variable selection: beyond the linear model
1107.1283v2	This work considers the problem of learning the structure of multivariate linear tree models, which include a variety of directed tree graphical models with continuous, discrete, and mixed latent variables such as linear-Gaussian models, hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models, and Markov evolutionary trees. The setting is one where we only have samples from certain observed variables in the tree, and our goal is to estimate the tree structure (i.e., the graph of how the underlying hidden variables are connected to each other and to the observed variables). We propose the Spectral Recursive Grouping algorithm, an efficient and simple bottom-up procedure for recovering the tree structure from independent samples of the observed variables. Our finite sample size bounds for exact recovery of the tree structure reveal certain natural dependencies on underlying statistical and structural properties of the underlying joint distribution. Furthermore, our sample complexity guarantees have no explicit dependence on the dimensionality of the observed variables, making the algorithm applicable to many high-dimensional settings. At the heart of our algorithm is a spectral quartet test for determining the relative topology of a quartet of variables from second-order statistics.

1606.08476v1	This paper proposes a novel dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process topic model that considers the dependence between successive observations. Conventional posterior inference algorithms for this kind of models require processing of the whole data through several passes. It is computationally intractable for massive or sequential data. We design the batch and online inference algorithms, based on the Gibbs sampling, for the proposed model. It allows to process sequential data, incrementally updating the model by a new observation. The model is applied to abnormal behaviour detection in video sequences. A new abnormality measure is proposed for decision making. The proposed method is compared with the method based on the non- dynamic Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, for which we also derive the online Gibbs sampler and the abnormality measure. The results with synthetic and real data show that the consideration of the dynamics in a topic model improves the classification performance for abnormal behaviour detection.

1703.01962v1	We discuss a Bayesian formulation to coarse-graining (CG) of PDEs where the coefficients (e.g. material parameters) exhibit random, fine scale variability. The direct solution to such problems requires grids that are small enough to resolve this fine scale variability which unavoidably requires the repeated solution of very large systems of algebraic equations. We establish a physically inspired, data-driven coarse-grained model which learns a low- dimensional set of microstructural features that are predictive of the fine-grained model (FG) response. Once learned, those features provide a sharp distribution over the coarse scale effec- tive coefficients of the PDE that are most suitable for prediction of the fine scale model output. This ultimately allows to replace the computationally expensive FG by a generative proba- bilistic model based on evaluating the much cheaper CG several times. Sparsity enforcing pri- ors further increase predictive efficiency and reveal microstructural features that are important in predicting the FG response. Moreover, the model yields probabilistic rather than single-point predictions, which enables the quantification of the unavoidable epistemic uncertainty that is present due to the information loss that occurs during the coarse-graining process.

1510.08512v1	Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are popular tools for studying network structures. However, many modern applications such as gene network discovery and social interactions analysis often involve high-dimensional noisy data with outliers or heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose the Trimmed Graphical Lasso for robust estimation of sparse GGMs. Our method guards against outliers by an implicit trimming mechanism akin to the popular Least Trimmed Squares method used for linear regression. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of our estimator in the high-dimensional setting. In contrast, existing approaches for robust sparse GGMs estimation lack statistical guarantees. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on simulated and real gene expression data which further demonstrate the value of our approach.

0809.4178v2	Approximate Bayesian inference on the basis of summary statistics is well-suited to complex problems for which the likelihood is either mathematically or computationally intractable. However the methods that use rejection suffer from the curse of dimensionality when the number of summary statistics is increased. Here we propose a machine-learning approach to the estimation of the posterior density by introducing two innovations. The new method fits a nonlinear conditional heteroscedastic regression of the parameter on the summary statistics, and then adaptively improves estimation using importance sampling. The new algorithm is compared to the state-of-the-art approximate Bayesian methods, and achieves considerable reduction of the computational burden in two examples of inference in statistical genetics and in a queueing model.

1610.09838v1	The analysis of nonstationary time series is of great importance in many scientific fields such as physics and neuroscience. In recent years, Gaussian process regression has attracted substantial attention as a robust and powerful method for analyzing time series. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing nonstationary time series using locally stationary Gaussian process analysis with parameters that are coupled through a hidden Markov model. The main advantage of this framework is that arbitrary complex nonstationary covariance functions can be obtained by combining simpler stationary building blocks whose hidden parameters can be estimated in closed-form. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by analyzing two examples of synthetic nonstationary signals: oscillations with time varying frequency and time series with two dynamical states. Finally, we report an example application on real magnetoencephalographic measurements of brain activity.	Analysis of Nonstationary Time Series Using Locally Coupled Gaussian  Processes
1801.06202v2	"Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in predictive model building, because of the small number of samples $(n)$ compared to the huge amount of features $(p)$. This ""$n<<p$"" property has hampered application of deep learning techniques for disease outcome classification. Sparse learning by incorporating external gene network information could be a potential solution to this issue. Still, the problem is very challenging because (1) there are tens of thousands of features and only hundreds of training samples, (2) the scale-free structure of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of convolutional neural networks. To address these issues and build a robust classification model, we propose the Graph-Embedded Deep Feedforward Networks (GEDFN), to integrate external relational information of features into the deep neural network architecture. The method is able to achieve sparse connection between network layers to prevent overfitting. To validate the method's capability, we conducted both simulation experiments and a real data analysis using a breast cancer RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The resulting high classification accuracy and easily interpretable feature selection results suggest the method is a useful addition to the current classification models and feature selection procedures.

1006.0849v1	We present a method for the reconstruction of networks, based on the order of nodes visited by a stochastic branching process. Our algorithm reconstructs a network of minimal size that ensures consistency with the data. Crucially, we show that global consistency with the data can be achieved through purely local considerations, inferring the neighbourhood of each node in turn. The optimisation problem solved for each individual node can be reduced to a Set Covering Problem, which is known to be NP-hard but can be approximated well in practice. We then extend our approach to account for noisy data, based on the Minimum Description Length principle. We demonstrate our algorithms on synthetic data, generated by an SIR-like epidemiological model.	Reconstruction of Causal Networks by Set Covering
1708.05258v1	"Choosing the best-performing optimizer(s) out of a portfolio of optimization algorithms is usually a difficult and complex task. It gets even worse, if the underlying functions are unknown, i.e., so-called Black-Box problems, and function evaluations are considered to be expensive. In the case of continuous single-objective optimization problems, Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) - a sophisticated and effective approach for characterizing the landscapes of such problems by means of numerical values before actually performing the optimization task itself - is advantageous. Unfortunately, until now it has been quite complicated to compute multiple ELA features simultaneously, as the corresponding code has been - if at all - spread across multiple platforms or at least across several packages within these platforms. This article presents a broad summary of existing ELA approaches and introduces flacco, an R-package for feature-based landscape analysis of continuous and constrained optimization problems. Although its functions neither solve the optimization problem itself nor the related ""Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP)"", it offers easy access to an essential ingredient of the ASP by providing a wide collection of ELA features on a single platform - even within a single package. In addition, flacco provides multiple visualization techniques, which enhance the understanding of some of these numerical features, and thereby make certain landscape properties more comprehensible. On top of that, we will introduce the package's build-in, as well as web-hosted and hence platform-independent, graphical user interface (GUI), which facilitates the usage of the package - especially for people who are not familiar with R - making it a very convenient toolbox when working towards algorithm selection of continuous single-objective optimization problems."

0709.2760v3	In recent years, kernel density estimation has been exploited by computer scientists to model machine learning problems. The kernel density estimation based approaches are of interest due to the low time complexity of either O(n) or O(n*log(n)) for constructing a classifier, where n is the number of sampling instances. Concerning design of kernel density estimators, one essential issue is how fast the pointwise mean square error (MSE) and/or the integrated mean square error (IMSE) diminish as the number of sampling instances increases. In this article, it is shown that with the proposed kernel function it is feasible to make the pointwise MSE of the density estimator converge at O(n^-2/3) regardless of the dimension of the vector space, provided that the probability density function at the point of interest meets certain conditions.

1305.6916v4	"Correlation matrices play a key role in many multivariate methods (e.g., graphical model estimation and factor analysis). The current state-of-the-art in estimating large correlation matrices focuses on the use of Pearson's sample correlation matrix. Although Pearson's sample correlation matrix enjoys various good properties under Gaussian models, it is not an effective estimator when facing heavy-tailed distributions. As a robust alternative, Han and Liu [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 109 (2015) 275-287] advocated the use of a transformed version of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix in estimating high dimensional latent generalized correlation matrix under the transelliptical distribution family (or elliptical copula). The transelliptical family assumes that after unspecified marginal monotone transformations, the data follow an elliptical distribution. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix and its transformed version proposed in Han and Liu [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 109 (2015) 275-287] for estimating the population Kendall's tau correlation matrix and the latent Pearson's correlation matrix under both spectral and restricted spectral norms. With regard to the spectral norm, we highlight the role of ""effective rank"" in quantifying the rate of convergence. With regard to the restricted spectral norm, we for the first time present a ""sign sub-Gaussian condition"" which is sufficient to guarantee that the rank-based correlation matrix estimator attains the fast rate of convergence. In both cases, we do not need any moment condition."	Statistical analysis of latent generalized correlation matrix estimation  in transelliptical distribution
1310.3561v4	We present a robust alternative to principal component analysis (PCA) --- called elliptical component analysis (ECA) --- for analyzing high dimensional, elliptically distributed data. ECA estimates the eigenspace of the covariance matrix of the elliptical data. To cope with heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, a multivariate rank statistic is exploited. At the model-level, we consider two settings: either that the leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are non-sparse or that they are sparse. Methodologically, we propose ECA procedures for both non-sparse and sparse settings. Theoretically, we provide both non-asymptotic and asymptotic analyses quantifying the theoretical performances of ECA. In the non-sparse setting, we show that ECA's performance is highly related to the effective rank of the covariance matrix. In the sparse setting, the results are twofold: (i) We show that the sparse ECA estimator based on a combinatoric program attains the optimal rate of convergence; (ii) Based on some recent developments in estimating sparse leading eigenvectors, we show that a computationally efficient sparse ECA estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence under a suboptimal scaling.

1605.03027v1	In this paper we propose a new method to predict the final destination of vehicle trips based on their initial partial trajectories. We first review how we obtained clustering of trajectories that describes user behaviour. Then, we explain how we model main traffic flow patterns by a mixture of 2d Gaussian distributions. This yielded a density based clustering of locations, which produces a data driven grid of similar points within each pattern. We present how this model can be used to predict the final destination of a new trajectory based on their first locations using a two step procedure: We first assign the new trajectory to the clusters it mot likely belongs. Secondly, we use characteristics from trajectories inside these clusters to predict the final destination. Finally, we present experimental results of our methods for classification of trajectories and final destination prediction on datasets of timestamped GPS-Location of taxi trips. We test our methods on two different datasets, to assess the capacity of our method to adapt automatically to different subsets.	Destination Prediction by Trajectory Distribution Based Model
1508.07535v1	A general approach for anomaly detection or novelty detection consists in estimating high density regions or Minimum Volume (MV) sets. The One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating such regions from high dimensional data. Yet it suffers from practical limitations. When applied to a limited number of samples it can lead to poor performance even when picking the best hyperparameters. Moreover the solution of OCSVM is very sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which makes it hard to optimize in an unsupervised setting. We present a new approach to estimate MV sets using the OCSVM with a different choice of the parameter controlling the proportion of outliers. The solution function of the OCSVM is learnt on a training set and the desired probability mass is obtained by adjusting the offset on a test set to prevent overfitting. Models learnt on different train/test splits are then aggregated to reduce the variance induced by such random splits. Our approach makes it possible to tune the hyperparameters automatically and obtain nested set estimates. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the standard OCSVM formulation while suffering less from the curse of dimensionality than kernel density estimates. Results on actual data sets are also presented.	Calibration of One-Class SVM for MV set estimation
1603.00389v2	We consider Bayesian optimization of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box objective function, where we also have access to cheaper approximations of the objective. In general, such approximations arise in applications such as reinforcement learning, engineering, and the natural sciences, and are subject to an inherent, unknown bias. This model discrepancy is caused by an inadequate internal model that deviates from reality and can vary over the domain, making the utilization of these approximations a non-trivial task. We present a novel algorithm that provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of the uncertainties arising from model discrepancies and noisy observations. Its optimization decisions rely on a value of information analysis that extends the Knowledge Gradient factor to the setting of multiple information sources that vary in cost: each sampling decision maximizes the predicted benefit per unit cost. We conduct an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that the method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques: it finds designs of considerably higher objective value and additionally inflicts less cost in the exploration process.

1612.00081v2	Variational inference provides a powerful tool for approximate probabilistic in- ference on complex, structured models. Typical variational inference methods, however, require to use inference networks with computationally tractable proba- bility density functions. This largely limits the design and implementation of vari- ational inference methods. We consider wild variational inference methods that do not require tractable density functions on the inference networks, and hence can be applied in more challenging cases. As an example of application, we treat stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as an inference network, and use our methods to automatically adjust the step sizes of SGLD, yielding significant improvement over the hand-designed step size schemes	Two Methods For Wild Variational Inference
1303.7410v2	We consider learning a causal ordering of variables in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model called LiNGAM. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But, the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions actually are violated. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. The key idea is to detect latent confounders by testing independence between estimated external influences and find subsets (parcels) that include variables that are not affected by latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data and simulated brain imaging data.	ParceLiNGAM: A causal ordering method robust against latent confounders
1609.07333v1	"In many applications (in particular information systems, such as pattern recognition, machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics to name but a few) the assessment of uncertainty is essential - i.e., the estimation of the underlying probability distribution function. More often than not, the form of this function is unknown and it becomes necessary to non-parametrically construct/estimate it from a given sample. One of the methods of choice to non-parametrically estimate the unknown probability distribution function for a given random variable (defined on binary space) has been the expansion of the estimation function in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions. In this paper we demonstrate that the expansion of the probability distribution function estimation in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions is equivalent to the expansion of the function estimation in a set of ""Dirac kernel"" functions. The latter approach can ameliorate the computational bottleneck and notational awkwardness often associated with the Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions approach, in particular when the binary input space is large."

1408.0850v5	"Recently, there has been focus on penalized log-likelihood covariance estimation for sparse inverse covariance (precision) matrices. The penalty is responsible for inducing sparsity, and a very common choice is the convex $l_1$ norm. However, the best estimator performance is not always achieved with this penalty. The most natural sparsity promoting ""norm"" is the non-convex $l_0$ penalty but its lack of convexity has deterred its use in sparse maximum likelihood estimation. In this paper we consider non-convex $l_0$ penalized log-likelihood inverse covariance estimation and present a novel cyclic descent algorithm for its optimization. Convergence to a local minimizer is proved, which is highly non-trivial, and we demonstrate via simulations the reduced bias and superior quality of the $l_0$ penalty as compared to the $l_1$ penalty."	L0 Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation
1703.09813v1	In high-dimensional and/or non-parametric regression problems, regularization (or penalization) is used to control model complexity and induce desired structure. Each penalty has a weight parameter that indicates how strongly the structure corresponding to that penalty should be enforced. Typically the parameters are chosen to minimize the error on a separate validation set using a simple grid search or a gradient-free optimization method. It is more efficient to tune parameters if the gradient can be determined, but this is often difficult for problems with non-smooth penalty functions. Here we show that for many penalized regression problems, the validation loss is actually smooth almost-everywhere with respect to the penalty parameters. We can therefore apply a modified gradient descent algorithm to tune parameters. Through simulation studies on example regression problems, we find that increasing the number of penalty parameters and tuning them using our method can decrease the generalization error.

1702.01811v1	This paper proposes a hierarchical feature extractor for non-stationary streaming time series based on the concept of switching observable Markov chain models. The slow time-scale non-stationary behaviors are considered to be a mixture of quasi-stationary fast time-scale segments that are exhibited by complex dynamical systems. The idea is to model each unique stationary characteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique characteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one low-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in the recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build an online algorithm suited for handling quasi-stationary data at a lower level and a non-stationary behavior at a higher level without a priori knowledge. A key observation made in this study is that the rate of change of data likelihood seems to be a better indicator of change in data characteristics compared to the traditional methods that mostly consider data likelihood for change detection. The algorithm minimizes model complexity and captures data likelihood. Efficacy demonstration and comparative evaluation of the proposed algorithm are performed using time series data simulated from systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. We discuss results that show that the proposed hierarchical SDF algorithm can identify underlying features with significantly high degree of accuracy, even under very noisy conditions. Algorithm is demonstrated to perform better than the baseline Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Hidden Markov Models (HDP-HMM). The low computational complexity of algorithm makes it suitable for on-board, real time operations.	Hierarchical Symbolic Dynamic Filtering of Streaming Non-stationary Time  Series Data
1602.00221v1	This paper presents a new framework for manifold learning based on a sequence of principal polynomials that capture the possibly nonlinear nature of the data. The proposed Principal Polynomial Analysis (PPA) generalizes PCA by modeling the directions of maximal variance by means of curves, instead of straight lines. Contrarily to previous approaches, PPA reduces to performing simple univariate regressions, which makes it computationally feasible and robust. Moreover, PPA shows a number of interesting analytical properties. First, PPA is a volume-preserving map, which in turn guarantees the existence of the inverse. Second, such an inverse can be obtained in closed form. Invertibility is an important advantage over other learning methods, because it permits to understand the identified features in the input domain where the data has physical meaning. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the performance of dimensionality reduction in sensible (input-domain) units. Volume preservation also allows an easy computation of information theoretic quantities, such as the reduction in multi-information after the transform. Third, the analytical nature of PPA leads to a clear geometrical interpretation of the manifold: it allows the computation of Frenet-Serret frames (local features) and of generalized curvatures at any point of the space. And fourth, the analytical Jacobian allows the computation of the metric induced by the data, thus generalizing the Mahalanobis distance. These properties are demonstrated theoretically and illustrated experimentally. The performance of PPA is evaluated in dimensionality and redundancy reduction, in both synthetic and real datasets from the UCI repository.	Principal Polynomial Analysis
1502.06689v1	We consider the problem of noisy 1-bit matrix completion under an exact rank constraint on the true underlying matrix $M^*$. Instead of observing a subset of the noisy continuous-valued entries of a matrix $M^*$, we observe a subset of noisy 1-bit (or binary) measurements generated according to a probabilistic model. We consider constrained maximum likelihood estimation of $M^*$, under a constraint on the entry-wise infinity-norm of $M^*$ and an exact rank constraint. This is in contrast to previous work which has used convex relaxations for the rank. We provide an upper bound on the matrix estimation error under this model. Compared to the existing results, our bound has faster convergence rate with matrix dimensions when the fraction of revealed 1-bit observations is fixed, independent of the matrix dimensions. We also propose an iterative algorithm for solving our nonconvex optimization with a certificate of global optimality of the limiting point. This algorithm is based on low rank factorization of $M^*$. We validate the method on synthetic and real data with improved performance over existing methods.	1-Bit Matrix Completion under Exact Low-Rank Constraint
1605.02674v2	Multivariate Analysis (MVA) comprises a family of well-known methods for feature extraction that exploit correlations among input variables of the data representation. One important property that is enjoyed by most such methods is uncorrelation among the extracted features. Recently, regularized versions of MVA methods have appeared in the literature, mainly with the goal to gain interpretability of the solution. In these cases, the solutions can no longer be obtained in a closed manner, and it is frequent to recur to the iteration of two steps, one of them being an orthogonal Procrustes problem. This letter shows that the Procrustes solution is not optimal from the perspective of the overall MVA method, and proposes an alternative approach based on the solution of an eigenvalue problem. Our method ensures the preservation of several properties of the original methods, most notably the uncorrelation of the extracted features, as demonstrated theoretically and through a collection of selected experiments.	Why (and How) Avoid Orthogonal Procrustes in Regularized Multivariate  Analysis
1801.08600v1	Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used BSS method that can uniquely achieve source recovery, subject to only scaling and permutation ambiguities, through the assumption of statistical independence on the part of the latent sources. Independent vector analysis (IVA) extends the applicability of ICA by jointly decomposing multiple datasets through the exploitation of the dependencies across datasets. Though both ICA and IVA algorithms cast in the maximum likelihood (ML) framework enable the use of all available statistical information in reality, they often deviate from their theoretical optimality properties due to improper estimation of the probability density function (PDF). This motivates the development of flexible ICA and IVA algorithms that closely adhere to the underlying statistical description of the data. Although it is attractive minimize the assumptions, important prior information about the data, such as sparsity, is usually available. If incorporated into the ICA model, use of this additional information can relax the independence assumption, resulting in an improvement in the overall separation performance. Therefore, the development of a unified mathematical framework that can take into account both statistical independence and sparsity is of great interest. In this work, we first introduce a flexible ICA algorithm that uses an effective PDF estimator to accurately capture the underlying statistical properties of the data. We then discuss several techniques to accurately estimate the parameters of the multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution, and how to integrate them into the IVA model. Finally, we provide a mathematical framework that enables direct control over the influence of statistical independence and sparsity, and use this framework to develop an effective ICA algorithm that can jointly exploit these two forms of diversity.

1010.1868v1	Actors in realistic social networks play not one but a number of diverse roles depending on whom they interact with, and a large number of such role-specific interactions collectively determine social communities and their organizations. Methods for analyzing social networks should capture these multi-faceted role-specific interactions, and, more interestingly, discover the latent organization or hierarchy of social communities. We propose a hierarchical Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel to model the generation of hierarchies in social communities, selective membership of actors to subsets of these communities, and the resultant networks due to within- and cross-community interactions. Furthermore, to automatically discover these latent structures from social networks, we develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm for our model. We conduct extensive validation of our model using synthetic networks, and demonstrate the utility of our model in real-world datasets such as predator-prey networks and citation networks.

1704.04285v2	The Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm has been widely used in solving nuclear norm constrained problems, since it does not require projections. However, FW often yields high rank intermediate iterates, which can be very expensive in time and space costs for large problems. To address this issue, we propose a rank-drop method for nuclear norm constrained problems. The goal is to generate descent steps that lead to rank decreases, maintaining low-rank solutions throughout the algorithm. Moreover, the optimization problems are constrained to ensure that the rank-drop step is also feasible and can be readily incorporated into a projection-free minimization method, e.g., Frank-Wolfe. We demonstrate that by incorporating rank-drop steps into the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, the rank of the solution is greatly reduced compared to the original Frank-Wolfe or its common variants.	Projection Free Rank-Drop Steps
1506.08002v1	Taking into account high-order interactions among covariates is valuable in many practical regression problems. This is, however, computationally challenging task because the number of high-order interaction features to be considered would be extremely large unless the number of covariates is sufficiently small. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient algorithm for LASSO-based sparse learning of such high-order interaction models. Our basic strategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently proposed safe feature screening (SFS) rule. An SFS rule has a property that, if a feature satisfies the rule, then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active in the LASSO solution, meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the LASSO training process. If a large number of features can be screened-out before training the LASSO, the computational cost and the memory requirment can be dramatically reduced. However, applying such an SFS rule to each of the extremely large number of high-order interaction features would be computationally infeasible. Our key idea for solving this computational issue is to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction features. Specifically, we introduce a pruning condition called safe feature pruning (SFP) rule which has a property that, if the rule is satisfied in a certain node of the tree, then all the high-order interaction features corresponding to its descendant nodes can be guaranteed to be non-active at the optimal solution. Our algorithm is extremely efficient, making it possible to work, e.g., with 3rd order interactions of 10,000 original covariates, where the number of possible high-order interaction features is greater than 10^{12}.	Safe Feature Pruning for Sparse High-Order Interaction Models
1609.08752v1	To date, the instability of prognostic predictors in a sparse high dimensional model, which hinders their clinical adoption, has received little attention. Stable prediction is often overlooked in favour of performance. Yet, stability prevails as key when adopting models in critical areas as healthcare. Our study proposes a stabilization scheme by detecting higher order feature correlations. Using a linear model as basis for prediction, we achieve feature stability by regularising latent correlation in features. Latent higher order correlation among features is modelled using an autoencoder network. Stability is enhanced by combining a recent technique that uses a feature graph, and augmenting external unlabelled data for training the autoencoder network. Our experiments are conducted on a heart failure cohort from an Australian hospital. Stability was measured using Consistency index for feature subsets and signal-to-noise ratio for model parameters. Our methods demonstrated significant improvement in feature stability and model estimation stability when compared to baselines.	Stabilizing Linear Prediction Models using Autoencoder
1709.09274v1	This paper presents a technique for reduced-order Markov modeling for compact representation of time-series data. In this work, symbolic dynamics-based tools have been used to infer an approximate generative Markov model. The time-series data are first symbolized by partitioning the continuous measurement space of the signal and then, the discrete sequential data are modeled using symbolic dynamics. In the proposed approach, the size of temporal memory of the symbol sequence is estimated from spectral properties of the resulting stochastic matrix corresponding to a first-order Markov model of the symbol sequence. Then, hierarchical clustering is used to represent the states of the corresponding full-state Markov model to construct a reduced-order or size Markov model with a non-deterministic algebraic structure. Subsequently, the parameters of the reduced-order Markov model are identified from the original model by making use of a Bayesian inference rule. The final model is selected using information-theoretic criteria. The proposed concept is elucidated and validated on two different data sets as examples. The first example analyzes a set of pressure data from a swirl-stabilized combustor, where controlled protocols are used to induce flame instabilities. Variations in the complexity of the derived Markov model represent how the system operating condition changes from a stable to an unstable combustion regime. In the second example, the data set is taken from NASA's data repository for prognostics of bearings on rotating shafts. We show that, even with a very small state-space, the reduced-order models are able to achieve comparable performance and that the proposed approach provides flexibility in the selection of a final model for representation and learning.

1707.00727v1	"Tomal et al. (2015) introduced the notion of ""phalanxes"" in the context of rare-class detection in two-class classification problems. A phalanx is a subset of features that work well for classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a different class of phalanxes for application in regression settings. We define a ""Regression Phalanx"" - a subset of features that work well together for prediction. We propose a novel algorithm which automatically chooses Regression Phalanxes from high-dimensional data sets using hierarchical clustering and builds a prediction model for each phalanx for further ensembling. Through extensive simulation studies and several real-life applications in various areas (including drug discovery, chemical analysis of spectra data, microarray analysis and climate projections) we show that an ensemble of Regression Phalanxes improves prediction accuracy when combined with effective prediction methods like Lasso or Random Forests."

1410.0555v2	This paper introduces a linear state-space model with time-varying dynamics. The time dependency is obtained by forming the state dynamics matrix as a time-varying linear combination of a set of matrices. The time dependency of the weights in the linear combination is modelled by another linear Gaussian dynamical model allowing the model to learn how the dynamics of the process changes. Previous approaches have used switching models which have a small set of possible state dynamics matrices and the model selects one of those matrices at each time, thus jumping between them. Our model forms the dynamics as a linear combination and the changes can be smooth and more continuous. The model is motivated by physical processes which are described by linear partial differential equations whose parameters vary in time. An example of such a process could be a temperature field whose evolution is driven by a varying wind direction. The posterior inference is performed using variational Bayesian approximation. The experiments on stochastic advection-diffusion processes and real-world weather processes show that the model with time-varying dynamics can outperform previously introduced approaches.

1705.09048v2	Langevin diffusion is a commonly used tool for sampling from a given distribution. In this work, we establish that when the target density $p^*$ is such that $\log p^*$ is $L$ smooth and $m$ strongly convex, discrete Langevin diffusion produces a distribution $p$ with $KL(p||p^*)\leq \epsilon$ in $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{\epsilon})$ steps, where $d$ is the dimension of the sample space. We also study the convergence rate when the strong-convexity assumption is absent. By considering the Langevin diffusion as a gradient flow in the space of probability distributions, we obtain an elegant analysis that applies to the stronger property of convergence in KL-divergence and gives a conceptually simpler proof of the best-known convergence results in weaker metrics.

1511.06120v1	In clinical and neuroscientific studies, systematic differences between two populations of brain networks are investigated in order to characterize mental diseases or processes. Those networks are usually represented as graphs built from neuroimaging data and studied by means of graph analysis methods. The typical machine learning approach to study these brain graphs creates a classifier and tests its ability to discriminate the two populations. In contrast to this approach, in this work we propose to directly test whether two populations of graphs are different or not, by using the kernel two-sample test (KTST), without creating the intermediate classifier. We claim that, in general, the two approaches provides similar results and that the KTST requires much less computation. Additionally, in the regime of low sample size, we claim that the KTST has lower frequency of Type II error than the classification approach. Besides providing algorithmic considerations to support these claims, we show strong evidence through experiments and one simulation.	The Kernel Two-Sample Test for Brain Networks
1210.0805v2	Many applications in data analysis rely on the decomposition of a data matrix into a low-rank and a sparse component. Existing methods that tackle this task use the nuclear norm and L1-cost functions as convex relaxations of the rank constraint and the sparsity measure, respectively, or employ thresholding techniques. We propose a method that allows for reconstructing and tracking a subspace of upper-bounded dimension from incomplete and corrupted observations. It does not require any a priori information about the number of outliers. The core of our algorithm is an intrinsic Conjugate Gradient method on the set of orthogonal projection matrices, the so-called Grassmannian. Non-convex sparsity measures are used for outlier detection, which leads to improved performance in terms of robustly recovering and tracking the low-rank matrix. In particular, our approach can cope with more outliers and with an underlying matrix of higher rank than other state-of-the-art methods.	Robust PCA and subspace tracking from incomplete observations using  L0-surrogates
1002.3684v1	Independent component analysis (ICA) aims at decomposing an observed random vector into statistically independent variables. Deflation-based implementations, such as the popular one-unit FastICA algorithm and its variants, extract the independent components one after another. A novel method for deflationary ICA, referred to as RobustICA, is put forward in this paper. This simple technique consists of performing exact line search optimization of the kurtosis contrast function. The step size leading to the global maximum of the contrast along the search direction is found among the roots of a fourth-degree polynomial. This polynomial rooting can be performed algebraically, and thus at low cost, at each iteration. Among other practical benefits, RobustICA can avoid prewhitening and deals with real- and complex-valued mixtures of possibly noncircular sources alike. The absence of prewhitening improves asymptotic performance. The algorithm is robust to local extrema and shows a very high convergence speed in terms of the computational cost required to reach a given source extraction quality, particularly for short data records. These features are demonstrated by a comparative numerical analysis on synthetic data. RobustICA's capabilities in processing real-world data involving noncircular complex strongly super-Gaussian sources are illustrated by the biomedical problem of atrial activity (AA) extraction in atrial fibrillation (AF) electrocardiograms (ECGs), where it outperforms an alternative ICA-based technique.

1710.01494v1	Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based approaches are the state-of-the-art in various computer vision tasks, including face recognition. Considerable research effort is currently being directed towards further improving deep CNNs by focusing on more powerful model architectures and better learning techniques. However, studies systematically exploring the strengths and weaknesses of existing deep models for face recognition are still relatively scarce in the literature. In this paper, we try to fill this gap and study the effects of different covariates on the verification performance of four recent deep CNN models using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. Specifically, we investigate the influence of covariates related to: image quality -- blur, JPEG compression, occlusion, noise, image brightness, contrast, missing pixels; and model characteristics -- CNN architecture, color information, descriptor computation; and analyze their impact on the face verification performance of AlexNet, VGG-Face, GoogLeNet, and SqueezeNet. Based on comprehensive and rigorous experimentation, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of the deep learning models, and present key areas for potential future research. Our results indicate that high levels of noise, blur, missing pixels, and brightness have a detrimental effect on the verification performance of all models, whereas the impact of contrast changes and compression artifacts is limited. It has been found that the descriptor computation strategy and color information does not have a significant influence on performance.	Strengths and Weaknesses of Deep Learning Models for Face Recognition  Against Image Degradations
0906.4258v1	Most accurate predictions are typically obtained by learning machines with complex feature spaces (as e.g. induced by kernels). Unfortunately, such decision rules are hardly accessible to humans and cannot easily be used to gain insights about the application domain. Therefore, one often resorts to linear models in combination with variable selection, thereby sacrificing some predictive power for presumptive interpretability. Here, we introduce the Feature Importance Ranking Measure (FIRM), which by retrospective analysis of arbitrary learning machines allows to achieve both excellent predictive performance and superior interpretation. In contrast to standard raw feature weighting, FIRM takes the underlying correlation structure of the features into account. Thereby, it is able to discover the most relevant features, even if their appearance in the training data is entirely prevented by noise. The desirable properties of FIRM are investigated analytically and illustrated in simulations.	The Feature Importance Ranking Measure
1608.02485v2	Boosting combines weak (biased) learners to obtain effective learning algorithms for classification and prediction. In this paper, we show a connection between boosting and kernel-based methods, highlighting both theoretical and practical applications. In the context of $\ell_2$ boosting, we start with a weak linear learner defined by a kernel $K$. We show that boosting with this learner is equivalent to estimation with a special {\it boosting kernel} that depends on $K$, as well as on the regression matrix, noise variance, and hyperparameters. The number of boosting iterations is modeled as a continuous hyperparameter, and fit along with other parameters using standard techniques. We then generalize the boosting kernel to a broad new class of boosting approaches for more general weak learners, including those based on the $\ell_1$, hinge and Vapnik losses. The approach allows fast hyperparameter tuning for this general class, and has a wide range of applications, including robust regression and classification. We illustrate some of these applications with numerical examples on synthetic and real data.	Boosting as a kernel-based method
1511.04157v1	For regular particle filter algorithm or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, the initial weights are traditionally dependent on the proposed distribution, the posterior distribution at the current timestamp in the sampled sequence, and the target is the posterior distribution of the previous timestamp. This is technically correct, but leads to algorithms which usually have practical issues with degeneracy, where all particles eventually collapse onto a single particle. In this paper, we propose and evaluate using $k$ means clustering to attack and even take advantage of this degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a Stochastic SMC algorithm which initializes the set of $k$ means, providing the initial centers chosen from the collapsed particles. To fight against degeneracy, we adjust the regular SMC weights, mediated by cluster proportions, and then correct them to retain the same expectation as before. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach has better performance than vanilla algorithms.	$k$-means: Fighting against Degeneracy in Sequential Monte Carlo with an  Application to Tracking
1610.04751v1	In this paper, we consider clustering data that is assumed to come from one of finitely many pointed convex polyhedral cones. This model is referred to as the Union of Polyhedral Cones (UOPC) model. Similar to the Union of Subspaces (UOS) model where each data from each subspace is generated from a (unknown) basis, in the UOPC model each data from each cone is assumed to be generated from a finite number of (unknown) \emph{extreme rays}.To cluster data under this model, we consider several algorithms - (a) Sparse Subspace Clustering by Non-negative constraints Lasso (NCL), (b) Least squares approximation (LSA), and (c) K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to arrive at affinity between data points. Spectral Clustering (SC) is then applied on the resulting affinity matrix to cluster data into different polyhedral cones. We show that on an average KNN outperforms both NCL and LSA and for this algorithm we provide the deterministic conditions for correct clustering. For an affinity measure between the cones it is shown that as long as the cones are not very coherent and as long as the density of data within each cone exceeds a threshold, KNN leads to accurate clustering. Finally, simulation results on real datasets (MNIST and YaleFace datasets) depict that the proposed algorithm works well on real data indicating the utility of the UOPC model and the proposed algorithm.	Unsupervised clustering under the Union of Polyhedral Cones (UOPC) model
1512.04937v1	The Stochastic Block Model (SBM) is a widely used random graph model for networks with communities. Despite the recent burst of interest in recovering communities in the SBM from statistical and computational points of view, there are still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic and computational limits of recovery. In this paper, we consider the SBM in its full generality, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of communities or how they grow with the number of nodes, as well as on the connection probabilities inside or across communities. This generality allows us to move past the artifacts of homogenous SBM, and understand the right parameters (such as the relative densities of communities) that define the various recovery thresholds. We outline the implications of our generalizations via a set of illustrative examples. For instance, $\log n$ is considered to be the standard lower bound on the cluster size for exact recovery via convex methods, for homogenous SBM. We show that it is possible, in the right circumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the cluster, the denser), to recover very small clusters (up to $\sqrt{\log n}$ size), if there are just a few of them (at most polylogarithmic in $n$).	Relative Density and Exact Recovery in Heterogeneous Stochastic Block  Models
1011.5395v1	A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classification, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the representation found by such a dictionary for a previously unseen example from the same source will have L_2 error of the same magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and study this questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the expected L_2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l_1 regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of the order of O(sqrt(np log(m lambda)/m)), where n is the dimension, p is the number of elements in the dictionary, lambda is a bound on the l_1 norm of the coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O(sqrt(np log(m k)/m)) under an assumption on the level of orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results further yield fast rates of order 1/m as opposed to 1/sqrt(m) using localized Rademacher complexity. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.	The Sample Complexity of Dictionary Learning
1406.0531v2	"One of the most fundamental problems in causal inference is the estimation of a causal effect when variables are confounded. This is difficult in an observational study, because one has no direct evidence that all confounders have been adjusted for. We introduce a novel approach for estimating causal effects that exploits observational conditional independencies to suggest ""weak"" paths in a unknown causal graph. The widely used faithfulness condition of Spirtes et al. is relaxed to allow for varying degrees of ""path cancellations"" that imply conditional independencies but do not rule out the existence of confounding causal paths. The outcome is a posterior distribution over bounds on the average causal effect via a linear programming approach and Bayesian inference. We claim this approach should be used in regular practice along with other default tools in observational studies."	Causal Inference through a Witness Protection Program
1502.01943v1	Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) have found many applications in density estimation and data clustering. However, the model does not adapt well to curved and strongly nonlinear data. Recently there appeared an improvement called AcaGMM (Active curve axis Gaussian Mixture Model), which fits Gaussians along curves using an EM-like (Expectation Maximization) approach. Using the ideas standing behind AcaGMM, we build an alternative active function model of clustering, which has some advantages over AcaGMM. In particular it is naturally defined in arbitrary dimensions and enables an easy adaptation to clustering of complicated datasets along the predefined family of functions. Moreover, it does not need external methods to determine the number of clusters as it automatically reduces the number of groups on-line.	Active Function Cross-Entropy Clustering
1606.05241v1	We introduce the Mondrian kernel, a fast random feature approximation to the Laplace kernel. It is suitable for both batch and online learning, and admits a fast kernel-width-selection procedure as the random features can be re-used efficiently for all kernel widths. The features are constructed by sampling trees via a Mondrian process [Roy and Teh, 2009], and we highlight the connection to Mondrian forests [Lakshminarayanan et al., 2014], where trees are also sampled via a Mondrian process, but fit independently. This link provides a new insight into the relationship between kernel methods and random forests.	The Mondrian Kernel
1702.08239v2	We present a model for random simple graphs with a degree distribution that obeys a power law (i.e., is heavy-tailed). To attain this behavior, the edge probabilities in the graph are constructed from Bertoin-Fujita-Roynette-Yor (BFRY) random variables, which have been recently utilized in Bayesian statistics for the construction of power law models in several applications. Our construction readily extends to capture the structure of latent factors, similarly to stochastic blockmodels, while maintaining its power law degree distribution. The BFRY random variables are well approximated by gamma random variables in a variational Bayesian inference routine, which we apply to several network datasets for which power law degree distributions are a natural assumption. By learning the parameters of the BFRY distribution via probabilistic inference, we are able to automatically select the appropriate power law behavior from the data. In order to further scale our inference procedure, we adopt stochastic gradient ascent routines where the gradients are computed on minibatches (i.e., subsets) of the edges in the graph.

1205.4120v1	Covariance graphical lasso applies a lasso penalty on the elements of the covariance matrix. This method is useful because it not only produces sparse estimation of covariance matrix but also discovers marginal independence structures by generating zeros in the covariance matrix. We propose and explore two new algorithms for solving the covariance graphical lasso problem. Our new algorithms are based on coordinate descent and ECM. We show that these two algorithms are more attractive than the only existing competing algorithm of Bien and Tibshirani (2011) in terms of simplicity, speed and stability. We also discuss convergence properties of our algorithms.	Two New Algorithms for Solving Covariance Graphical Lasso Based on  Coordinate Descent and ECM
1605.04262v1	Given two possible treatments, there may exist subgroups who benefit greater from one treatment than the other. This problem is relevant to the field of marketing, where treatments may correspond to different ways of selling a product. It is similarly relevant to the field of public policy, where treatments may correspond to specific government programs. And finally, personalized medicine is a field wholly devoted to understanding which subgroups of individuals will benefit from particular medical treatments. We present a computationally fast tree-based method, ABtree, for treatment effect differentiation. Unlike other methods, ABtree specifically produces decision rules for optimal treatment assignment on a per-individual basis. The treatment choices are selected for maximizing the overall occurrence of a desired binary outcome, conditional on a set of covariates. In this poster, we present the methodology on tree growth and pruning, and show performance results when applied to simulated data as well as real data.

1208.4183v1	A very important topic in systems biology is developing statistical methods that automatically find causal relations in gene regulatory networks with no prior knowledge of causal connectivity. Many methods have been developed for time series data. However, discovery methods based on steady-state data are often necessary and preferable since obtaining time series data can be more expensive and/or infeasible for many biological systems. A conventional approach is causal Bayesian networks. However, estimation of Bayesian networks is ill-posed. In many cases it cannot uniquely identify the underlying causal network and only gives a large class of equivalent causal networks that cannot be distinguished between based on the data distribution. We propose a new discovery algorithm for uniquely identifying the underlying causal network of genes. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first algorithm for learning gene networks based on a fully identifiable causal model called LiNGAM. We here compare our algorithm with competing algorithms using artificially-generated data, although it is definitely better to test it based on real microarray gene expression data.

1205.1828v1	The natural gradient allows for more efficient gradient descent by removing dependencies and biases inherent in a function's parameterization. Several papers present the topic thoroughly and precisely. It remains a very difficult idea to get your head around however. The intent of this note is to provide simple intuition for the natural gradient and its use. We review how an ill conditioned parameter space can undermine learning, introduce the natural gradient by analogy to the more widely understood concept of signal whitening, and present tricks and specific prescriptions for applying the natural gradient to learning problems.	The Natural Gradient by Analogy to Signal Whitening, and Recipes and  Tricks for its Use
1608.08659v1	Gaussian graphical models are widely used to represent conditional dependence among random variables. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for data arising from a group of Gaussian graphical models that are themselves dependent. A motivating example is that of modeling gene expression collected on multiple tissues from the same individual: here the multivariate outcome is affected by dependencies acting not only at the level of the specific tissues, but also at the level of the whole body; existing methods that assume independence among graphs are not applicable in this case. To estimate multiple dependent graphs, we decompose the problem into two graphical layers: the systemic layer, which affects all outcomes and thereby induces cross- graph dependence, and the category-specific layer, which represents graph-specific variation. We propose a graphical EM technique that estimates both layers jointly, establish estimation consistency and selection sparsistency of the proposed estimator, and confirm by simulation that the EM method is superior to a simple one-step method. We apply our technique to mouse genomics data and obtain biologically plausible results.	Joint Estimation of Multiple Dependent Gaussian Graphical Models with  Applications to Mouse Genomics
1202.3712v1	This paper examines the problem of learning with a finite and possibly large set of p base kernels. It presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of an approach addressing this problem based on ensembles of kernel predictors. This includes novel theoretical guarantees based on the Rademacher complexity of the corresponding hypothesis sets, the introduction and analysis of a learning algorithm based on these hypothesis sets, and a series of experiments using ensembles of kernel predictors with several data sets. Both convex combinations of kernel-based hypotheses and more general Lq-regularized nonnegative combinations are analyzed. These theoretical, algorithmic, and empirical results are compared with those achieved by using learning kernel techniques, which can be viewed as another approach for solving the same problem.	Ensembles of Kernel Predictors
1202.3757v1	This work addresses the following question: Under what assumptions on the data generating process can one infer the causal graph from the joint distribution? The approach taken by conditional independence-based causal discovery methods is based on two assumptions: the Markov condition and faithfulness. It has been shown that under these assumptions the causal graph can be identified up to Markov equivalence (some arrows remain undirected) using methods like the PC algorithm. In this work we propose an alternative by defining Identifiable Functional Model Classes (IFMOCs). As our main theorem we prove that if the data generating process belongs to an IFMOC, one can identify the complete causal graph. To the best of our knowledge this is the first identifiability result of this kind that is not limited to linear functional relationships. We discuss how the IFMOC assumption and the Markov and faithfulness assumptions relate to each other and explain why we believe that the IFMOC assumption can be tested more easily on given data. We further provide a practical algorithm that recovers the causal graph from finitely many data; experiments on simulated data support the theoretical findings.	Identifiability of Causal Graphs using Functional Models
1008.5209v1	We consider a class of learning problems that involve a structured sparsity-inducing norm defined as the sum of $\ell_\infty$-norms over groups of variables. Whereas a lot of effort has been put in developing fast optimization methods when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a specific hierarchical structure, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we show that the corresponding optimization problem is related to network flow optimization. More precisely, the proximal problem associated with the norm we consider is dual to a quadratic min-cost flow problem. We propose an efficient procedure which computes its solution exactly in polynomial time. Our algorithm scales up to millions of variables, and opens up a whole new range of applications for structured sparse models. We present several experiments on image and video data, demonstrating the applicability and scalability of our approach for various problems.	Network Flow Algorithms for Structured Sparsity
1705.05355v1	In order to achieve state-of-the-art performance, modern machine learning techniques require careful data pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, given the ever increasing number of machine learning models being developed, model selection is becoming increasingly important. Automating the selection and tuning of machine learning pipelines consisting of data pre-processing methods and machine learning models, has long been one of the goals of the machine learning community. In this paper, we tackle this meta-learning task by combining ideas from collaborative filtering and Bayesian optimization. Using probabilistic matrix factorization techniques and acquisition functions from Bayesian optimization, we exploit experiments performed in hundreds of different datasets to guide the exploration of the space of possible pipelines. In our experiments, we show that our approach quickly identifies high-performing pipelines across a wide range of datasets, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art.	Probabilistic Matrix Factorization for Automated Machine Learning
1309.6415v2	Theory of graphical models has matured over more than three decades to provide the backbone for several classes of models that are used in a myriad of applications such as genetic mapping of diseases, credit risk evaluation, reliability and computer security, etc. Despite of their generic applicability and wide adoptance, the constraints imposed by undirected graphical models and Bayesian networks have also been recognized to be unnecessarily stringent under certain circumstances. This observation has led to the proposal of several generalizations that aim at more relaxed constraints by which the models can impose local or context-specific dependence structures. Here we consider an additional class of such models, termed as stratified graphical models. We develop a method for Bayesian learning of these models by deriving an analytical expression for the marginal likelihood of data under a specific subclass of decomposable stratified models. A non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is further used to identify models that are highly supported by the posterior distribution over the model space. Our method is illustrated and compared with ordinary graphical models through application to several real and synthetic datasets.

0910.0526v1	The Lasso is a very well known penalized regression model, which adds an $L_{1}$ penalty with parameter $\lambda_{1}$ on the coefficients to the squared error loss function. The Fused Lasso extends this model by also putting an $L_{1}$ penalty with parameter $\lambda_{2}$ on the difference of neighboring coefficients, assuming there is a natural ordering. In this paper, we develop a fast path algorithm for solving the Fused Lasso Signal Approximator that computes the solutions for all values of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. In the supplement, we also give an algorithm for the general Fused Lasso for the case with predictor matrix $\bX \in \mathds{R}^{n \times p}$ with $\text{rank}(\bX)=p$.

DL-FUMI estimates a ""heartbeat concept"" that represents an individual's personal ballistocardiogram heartbeat pattern. DL-FUMI formulates heartbeat detection and heartbeat characterization as a multiple instance learning problem to address the uncertainty inherent in aligning BCG signals with ground truth during training. Experimental results show that the estimated heartbeat concept found by DL-FUMI is an effective heartbeat prototype and achieves superior performance over comparison algorithms."

1707.08493v1	Bayesian nonparametrics are a class of probabilistic models in which the model size is inferred from data. A recently developed methodology in this field is small-variance asymptotic analysis, a mathematical technique for deriving learning algorithms that capture much of the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric inference algorithms, but are simpler to implement and less computationally expensive. Past work on small-variance analysis of Bayesian nonparametric inference algorithms has exclusively considered batch models trained on a single, static dataset, which are incapable of capturing time evolution in the latent structure of the data. This work presents a small-variance analysis of the maximum a posteriori filtering problem for a temporally varying mixture model with a Markov dependence structure, which captures temporally evolving clusters within a dataset. Two clustering algorithms result from the analysis: D-Means, an iterative clustering algorithm for linearly separable, spherical clusters; and SD-Means, a spectral clustering algorithm derived from a kernelized, relaxed version of the clustering problem. Empirical results from experiments demonstrate the advantages of using D-Means and SD-Means over contemporary clustering algorithms, in terms of both computational cost and clustering accuracy.

1205.0288v2	We consider the problem of simultaneously learning to linearly combine a very large number of kernels and learn a good predictor based on the learnt kernel. When the number of kernels $d$ to be combined is very large, multiple kernel learning methods whose computational cost scales linearly in $d$ are intractable. We propose a randomized version of the mirror descent algorithm to overcome this issue, under the objective of minimizing the group $p$-norm penalized empirical risk. The key to achieve the required exponential speed-up is the computationally efficient construction of low-variance estimates of the gradient. We propose importance sampling based estimates, and find that the ideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show the surprising result that in the case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorial structure of the base kernels to be combined allows the implementation of sampling from this distribution to run in $O(\log(d))$ time, making the total computational cost of the method to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal solution to be $O(\log(d)/\epsilon^2)$, thereby allowing our method to operate for very large values of $d$. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that the new algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-art alternatives.

1612.01490v3	Noise injection (NI) is an approach to mitigate over-fitting in feedforward neural networks (NNs). The Bernoulli NI procedure as implemented in dropout and shakeout has connections with $l_1$ and $l_2$ regularization on the NN model parameters and demonstrates the efficiency and feasibility of NI in regularizing NNs. We propose whiteout, a new NI regularization technique with adaptive Gaussian noise in NNs. Whiteout is more versatile than dropout and shakeout. We show that the optimization objective function associated with whiteout in generalized linear models has a closed-form penalty term that has connections with a wide range of regularization and includes the bridge, lasso, ridge, and elastic net penalization as special cases; it can be also extended to offer regularization similar to the adaptive lasso and group lasso. We prove that whiteout can also be viewed as robust learning of NNs in the presence of small perturbations in input and hidden nodes. We establish that the noise-perturbed empirical loss function with whiteout converges almost surely to the ideal loss function, and the estimates of NN parameters obtained from minimizing the former loss function are consistent with those obtained from minimizing the ideal loss function. Computationally, whiteout can be easily incorporated in the back-propagation algorithm. The superiority of whiteout over dropout and shakeout in learning NNs with relatively small sized training data is demonstrated using the the LSVT voice rehabilitation data and the LIBRAS hand movement data.

1103.4614v2	We present two sets of theoretical results on the grouped lasso with overlap of Jacob, Obozinski and Vert (2009) in the linear regression setting. This method allows for joint selection of predictors in sparse regression, allowing for complex structured sparsity over the predictors encoded as a set of groups. This flexible framework suggests that arbitrarily complex structures can be encoded with an intricate set of groups. Our results show that this strategy results in unexpected theoretical consequences for the procedure. In particular, we give two sets of results: (1) finite sample bounds on prediction and estimation, and (2) asymptotic distribution and selection. Both sets of results give insight into the consequences of choosing an increasingly complex set of groups for the procedure, as well as what happens when the set of groups cannot recover the true sparsity pattern. Additionally, these results demonstrate the differences and similarities between the the grouped lasso procedure with and without overlapping groups. Our analysis shows the set of groups must be chosen with caution - an overly complex set of groups will damage the analysis.	Theoretical Properties of the Overlapping Groups Lasso
1506.03768v1	Learning of low dimensional structure in multidimensional data is a canonical problem in machine learning. One common approach is to suppose that the observed data are close to a lower-dimensional smooth manifold. There are a rich variety of manifold learning methods available, which allow mapping of data points to the manifold. However, there is a clear lack of probabilistic methods that allow learning of the manifold along with the generative distribution of the observed data. The best attempt is the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), but identifiability issues lead to poor performance. We solve these issues by proposing a novel Coulomb repulsive process (Corp) for locations of points on the manifold, inspired by physical models of electrostatic interactions among particles. Combining this process with a GP prior for the mapping function yields a novel electrostatic GP (electroGP) process. Focusing on the simple case of a one-dimensional manifold, we develop efficient inference algorithms, and illustrate substantially improved performance in a variety of experiments including filling in missing frames in video.

1507.05117v1	Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) using a sequential Monte Carlo method provides a comprehensive platform for parameter estimation, model selection and sensitivity analysis in differential equations. However, this method, like other Monte Carlo methods, incurs a significant computational cost as it requires explicit numerical integration of differential equations to carry out inference. In this paper we propose a novel method for circumventing the requirement of explicit integration by using derivatives of Gaussian processes to smooth the observations from which parameters are estimated. We evaluate our methods using synthetic data generated from model biological systems described by ordinary and delay differential equations. Upon comparing the performance of our method to existing ABC techniques, we demonstrate that it produces comparably reliable parameter estimates at a significantly reduced execution time.

1306.5310v1	Adaptive filtering algorithms operating in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have demonstrated superiority over their linear counterpart for nonlinear system identification. Unfortunately, an undesirable characteristic of these methods is that the order of the filters grows linearly with the number of input data. This dramatically increases the computational burden and memory requirement. A variety of strategies based on dictionary learning have been proposed to overcome this severe drawback. Few, if any, of these works analyze the problem of updating the dictionary in a time-varying environment. In this paper, we present an analytical study of the convergence behavior of the Gaussian least-mean-square algorithm in the case where the statistics of the dictionary elements only partially match the statistics of the input data. This allows us to emphasize the need for updating the dictionary in an online way, by discarding the obsolete elements and adding appropriate ones. We introduce a kernel least-mean-square algorithm with L1-norm regularization to automatically perform this task. The stability in the mean of this method is analyzed, and its performance is tested with experiments.	Online dictionary learning for kernel LMS. Analysis and forward-backward  splitting algorithm
0710.3742v1	Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.	Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection

1205.2608v1	Temporal-difference (TD) networks are a class of predictive state representations that use well-established TD methods to learn models of partially observable dynamical systems. Previous research with TD networks has dealt only with dynamical systems with finite sets of observations and actions. We present an algorithm for learning TD network representations of dynamical systems with continuous observations and actions. Our results show that the algorithm is capable of learning accurate and robust models of several noisy continuous dynamical systems. The algorithm presented here is the first fully incremental method for learning a predictive representation of a continuous dynamical system.

0910.0949v1	We present here an introduction to Brainstorming approach, that was recently proposed as a consensus meta-learning technique, and used in several practical applications in bioinformatics and chemoinformatics. The consensus learning denotes heterogeneous theoretical classification method, where one trains an ensemble of machine learning algorithms using different types of input training data representations. In the second step all solutions are gathered and the consensus is build between them. Therefore no early solution, given even by a generally low performing algorithm, is not discarder until the late phase of prediction, when the final conclusion is drawn by comparing different machine learning models. This final phase, i.e. consensus learning, is trying to balance the generality of solution and the overall performance of trained model.	BRAINSTORMING: Consensus Learning in Practice
1611.00866v1	Tensor decomposition is an important technique for capturing the high-order interactions among multiway data. Multi-linear tensor composition methods, such as the Tucker decomposition and the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP), assume that the complex interactions among objects are multi-linear, and are thus insufficient to represent nonlinear relationships in data. Another assumption of these methods is that a predefined rank should be known. However, the rank of tensors is hard to estimate, especially for cases with missing values. To address these issues, we design a Bayesian generative model for tensor decomposition. Different from the traditional Bayesian methods, the high-order interactions of tensor entries are modeled with variational auto-encoder. The proposed model takes advantages of Neural Networks and nonparametric Bayesian models, by replacing the multi-linear product in traditional Bayesian tensor decomposition with a complex nonlinear function (via Neural Networks) whose parameters can be learned from data. Experimental results on synthetic data and real-world chemometrics tensor data have demonstrated that our new model can achieve significantly higher prediction performance than the state-of-the-art tensor decomposition approaches.

1112.3827v1	This paper is devoted to regret lower bounds in the classical model of stochastic multi-armed bandit. A well-known result of Lai and Robbins, which has then been extended by Burnetas and Katehakis, has established the presence of a logarithmic bound for all consistent policies. We relax the notion of consistence, and exhibit a generalisation of the logarithmic bound. We also show the non existence of logarithmic bound in the general case of Hannan consistency. To get these results, we study variants of popular Upper Confidence Bounds (ucb) policies. As a by-product, we prove that it is impossible to design an adaptive policy that would select the best of two algorithms by taking advantage of the properties of the environment.

0802.1244v1	We study the problem of partitioning a small sample of $n$ individuals from a mixture of $k$ product distributions over a Boolean cube $\{0, 1\}^K$ according to their distributions. Each distribution is described by a vector of allele frequencies in $\R^K$. Given two distributions, we use $\gamma$ to denote the average $\ell_2^2$ distance in frequencies across $K$ dimensions, which measures the statistical divergence between them. We study the case assuming that bits are independently distributed across $K$ dimensions. This work demonstrates that, for a balanced input instance for $k = 2$, a certain graph-based optimization function returns the correct partition with high probability, where a weighted graph $G$ is formed over $n$ individuals, whose pairwise hamming distances between their corresponding bit vectors define the edge weights, so long as $K = \Omega(\ln n/\gamma)$ and $Kn = \tilde\Omega(\ln n/\gamma^2)$. The function computes a maximum-weight balanced cut of $G$, where the weight of a cut is the sum of the weights across all edges in the cut. This result demonstrates a nice property in the high-dimensional feature space: one can trade off the number of features that are required with the size of the sample to accomplish certain tasks like clustering.

1202.3736v1	Discovering causal relations among observed variables in a given data set is a main topic in studies of statistics and artificial intelligence. Recently, some techniques to discover an identifiable causal structure have been explored based on non-Gaussianity of the observed data distribution. However, most of these are limited to continuous data. In this paper, we present a novel causal model for binary data and propose a new approach to derive an identifiable causal structure governing the data based on skew Bernoulli distributions of external noise. Experimental evaluation shows excellent performance for both artificial and real world data sets.	Discovering causal structures in binary exclusive-or skew acyclic models
1608.03817v3	Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) are powerful models for sequential data but they do not scale well with long sequences. We propose a scalable inference and learning algorithm for FHMMs that draws on ideas from the stochastic variational inference, neural network and copula literatures. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed algorithm requires no message passing procedure among latent variables and can be distributed to a network of computers to speed up learning. Our experiments corroborate that the proposed algorithm does not introduce further approximation bias compared to the proven structured mean-field algorithm, and achieves better performance with long sequences and large FHMMs.	Scaling Factorial Hidden Markov Models: Stochastic Variational Inference  without Messages
1604.04191v1	Due to challenging applications such as collaborative filtering, the matrix completion problem has been widely studied in the past few years. Different approaches rely on different structure assumptions on the matrix in hand. Here, we focus on the completion of a (possibly) low-rank matrix with binary entries, the so-called 1-bit matrix completion problem. Our approach relies on tools from machine learning theory: empirical risk minimization and its convex relaxations. We propose an algorithm to compute a variational approximation of the pseudo-posterior. Thanks to the convex relaxation, the corresponding minimization problem is bi-convex, and thus the method behaves well in practice. We also study the performance of this variational approximation through PAC-Bayesian learning bounds. On the contrary to previous works that focused on upper bounds on the estimation error of M with various matrix norms, we are able to derive from this analysis a PAC bound on the prediction error of our algorithm. We focus essentially on convex relaxation through the hinge loss, for which we present the complete analysis, a complete simulation study and a test on the MovieLens data set. However, we also discuss a variational approximation to deal with the logistic loss.	1-bit Matrix Completion: PAC-Bayesian Analysis of a Variational  Approximation
1712.00288v1	In this paper, we study the effects of different prior and likelihood choices for Bayesian matrix factorisation, focusing on small datasets. These choices can greatly influence the predictive performance of the methods. We identify four groups of approaches: Gaussian-likelihood with real-valued priors, nonnegative priors, semi-nonnegative models, and finally Poisson-likelihood approaches. For each group we review several models from the literature, considering sixteen in total, and discuss the relations between different priors and matrix norms. We extensively compare these methods on eight real-world datasets across three application areas, giving both inter- and intra-group comparisons. We measure convergence runtime speed, cross-validation performance, sparse and noisy prediction performance, and model selection robustness. We offer several insights into the trade-offs between prior and likelihood choices for Bayesian matrix factorisation on small datasets - such as that Poisson models give poor predictions, and that nonnegative models are more constrained than real-valued ones.	Prior and Likelihood Choices for Bayesian Matrix Factorisation on Small  Datasets
1701.01582v2	Recent years have seen an increasing popularity of learning the sparse \emph{changes} in Markov Networks. Changes in the structure of Markov Networks reflect alternations of interactions between random variables under different regimes and provide insights into the underlying system. While each individual network structure can be complicated and difficult to learn, the overall change from one network to another can be simple. This intuition gave birth to an approach that \emph{directly} learns the sparse changes without modelling and learning the individual (possibly dense) networks. In this paper, we review such a direct learning method with some latest developments along this line of research.	Learning Sparse Structural Changes in High-dimensional Markov Networks:  A Review on Methodologies and Theories
1410.0860v1	In recent years rank aggregation has received significant attention from the machine learning community. The goal of such a problem is to combine the (partially revealed) preferences over objects of a large population into a single, relatively consistent ordering of those objects. However, in many cases, we might not want a single ranking and instead opt for individual rankings. We study a version of the problem known as collaborative ranking. In this problem we assume that individual users provide us with pairwise preferences (for example purchasing one item over another). From those preferences we wish to obtain rankings on items that the users have not had an opportunity to explore. The results here have a very interesting connection to the standard matrix completion problem. We provide a theoretical justification for a nuclear norm regularized optimization procedure, and provide high-dimensional scaling results that show how the error in estimating user preferences behaves as the number of observations increase.	Individualized Rank Aggregation using Nuclear Norm Regularization
1605.05697v1	We study the problem of estimating the parameters of a regression model from a set of observations, each consisting of a response and a predictor. The response is assumed to be related to the predictor via a regression model of unknown parameters. Often, in such models the parameters to be estimated are assumed to be constant. Here we consider the more general scenario where the parameters are allowed to evolve over time, a more natural assumption for many applications. We model these dynamics via a linear update equation with additive noise that is often used in a wide range of engineering applications, particularly in the well-known and widely used Kalman filter (where the system state it seeks to estimate maps to the parameter values here). We derive an approximate algorithm to estimate both the mean and the variance of the parameter estimates in an online fashion for a generic regression model. This algorithm turns out to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter. We specialize our algorithm to the multivariate exponential family distribution to obtain a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM). Because the common regression models encountered in practice such as logistic, exponential and multinomial all have observations modeled through an exponential family distribution, our results are used to easily obtain algorithms for online mean and variance parameter estimation for all these regression models in the context of time-dependent parameters. Lastly, we propose to use these algorithms in the contextual multi-armed bandit scenario, where so far model parameters are assumed static and observations univariate and Gaussian or Bernoulli. Both of these restrictions can be relaxed using the algorithms described here, which we combine with Thompson sampling to show the resulting performance on a simulation.	Online Algorithms For Parameter Mean And Variance Estimation In Dynamic  Regression Models
1009.2139v4	Sparse coding consists in representing signals as sparse linear combinations of atoms selected from a dictionary. We consider an extension of this framework where the atoms are further assumed to be embedded in a tree. This is achieved using a recently introduced tree-structured sparse regularization norm, which has proven useful in several applications. This norm leads to regularized problems that are difficult to optimize, and we propose in this paper efficient algorithms for solving them. More precisely, we show that the proximal operator associated with this norm is computable exactly via a dual approach that can be viewed as the composition of elementary proximal operators. Our procedure has a complexity linear, or close to linear, in the number of atoms, and allows the use of accelerated gradient techniques to solve the tree-structured sparse approximation problem at the same computational cost as traditional ones using the L1-norm. Our method is efficient and scales gracefully to millions of variables, which we illustrate in two types of applications: first, we consider fixed hierarchical dictionaries of wavelets to denoise natural images. Then, we apply our optimization tools in the context of dictionary learning, where learned dictionary elements naturally organize in a prespecified arborescent structure, leading to a better performance in reconstruction of natural image patches. When applied to text documents, our method learns hierarchies of topics, thus providing a competitive alternative to probabilistic topic models.	Proximal Methods for Hierarchical Sparse Coding
1602.00360v1	Traditionally, practitioners initialize the {\tt k-means} algorithm with centers chosen uniformly at random. Randomized initialization with uneven weights ({\tt k-means++}) has recently been used to improve the performance over this strategy in cost and run-time. We consider the k-means problem with semi-supervised information, where some of the data are pre-labeled, and we seek to label the rest according to the minimum cost solution. By extending the {\tt k-means++} algorithm and analysis to account for the labels, we derive an improved theoretical bound on expected cost and observe improved performance in simulated and real data examples. This analysis provides theoretical justification for a roughly linear semi-supervised clustering algorithm.	Semi-supervised K-means++
1401.3291v2	In this work we consider the problem of detecting anomalous spatio-temporal behavior in videos. Our approach is to learn the normative multiframe pixel joint distribution and detect deviations from it using a likelihood based approach. Due to the extreme lack of available training samples relative to the dimension of the distribution, we use a mean and covariance approach and consider methods of learning the spatio-temporal covariance in the low-sample regime. Our approach is to estimate the covariance using parameter reduction and sparse models. The first method considered is the representation of the covariance as a sum of Kronecker products as in (Greenewald et al 2013), which is found to be an accurate approximation in this setting. We propose learning algorithms relevant to our problem. We then consider the sparse multiresolution model of (Choi et al 2010) and apply the Kronecker product methods to it for further parameter reduction, as well as introducing modifications for enhanced efficiency and greater applicability to spatio-temporal covariance matrices. We apply our methods to the detection of crowd behavior anomalies in the University of Minnesota crowd anomaly dataset, and achieve competitive results.

1603.01029v2	"Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is an unsupervised linear dimension reduction method that extracts low-dimensional non-Gaussian ""signals"" from high-dimensional data contaminated with Gaussian noise. NGCA can be regarded as a generalization of projection pursuit (PP) and independent component analysis (ICA) to multi-dimensional and dependent non-Gaussian components. Indeed, seminal approaches to NGCA are based on PP and ICA. Recently, a novel NGCA approach called least-squares NGCA (LSNGCA) has been developed, which gives a solution analytically through least-squares estimation of log-density gradients and eigendecomposition. However, since pre-whitening of data is involved in LSNGCA, it performs unreliably when the data covariance matrix is ill-conditioned, which is often the case in high-dimensional data analysis. In this paper, we propose a whitening-free LSNGCA method and experimentally demonstrate its superiority."	Whitening-Free Least-Squares Non-Gaussian Component Analysis
1410.1184v3	We propose a novel graphical model selection (GMS) scheme for high-dimensional stationary time series or discrete time process. The method is based on a natural generalization of the graphical LASSO (gLASSO), introduced originally for GMS based on i.i.d. samples, and estimates the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a time series from a finite length observation. The gLASSO for time series is defined as the solution of an l1-regularized maximum (approximate) likelihood problem. We solve this optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our approach is nonparametric as we do not assume a finite dimensional (e.g., an autoregressive) parametric model for the observed process. Instead, we require the process to be sufficiently smooth in the spectral domain. For Gaussian processes, we characterize the performance of our method theoretically by deriving an upper bound on the probability that our algorithm fails to correctly identify the CIG. Numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to recover the correct CIG from a limited amount of samples.	Graphical LASSO Based Model Selection for Time Series
1204.0656v1	Existing methods for sparse channel estimation typically provide an estimate computed as the solution maximizing an objective function defined as the sum of the log-likelihood function and a penalization term proportional to the l1-norm of the parameter of interest. However, other penalization terms have proven to have strong sparsity-inducing properties. In this work, we design pilot-assisted channel estimators for OFDM wireless receivers within the framework of sparse Bayesian learning by defining hierarchical Bayesian prior models that lead to sparsity-inducing penalization terms. The estimators result as an application of the variational message-passing algorithm on the factor graph representing the signal model extended with the hierarchical prior models. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of our channel estimators as compared to traditional and state-of-the-art sparse methods.	Application of Bayesian Hierarchical Prior Modeling to Sparse Channel  Estimation
1511.07318v1	In this document we are going to derive the equations needed to implement a Variational Bayes estimation of the parameters of the simplified probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (SPLDA) model. This can be used to adapt SPLDA from one database to another with few development data or to implement the fully Bayesian recipe. Our approach is similar to Bishop's VB PPCA.	Bayesian SPLDA
1706.08699v1	Power supply from renewable resources is on a global rise where it is forecasted that renewable generation will surpass other types of generation in a foreseeable future. Increased generation from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind, exposes the power grid to more vulnerabilities, conceivably due to their variable generation, thus highlighting the importance of accurate forecasting methods. This paper proposes a two-stage day-ahead solar forecasting method that breaks down the forecasting into linear and nonlinear parts, determines subsequent forecasts, and accordingly, improves accuracy of the obtained results. To further reduce the error resulted from nonstationarity of the historical solar radiation data, a data processing approach, including pre-process and post-process levels, is integrated with the proposed method. Numerical simulations on three test days with different weather conditions exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage model.	Two-Stage Hybrid Day-Ahead Solar Forecasting
1610.07407v5	We introduce a mixture model for censored durations (C-mix), and develop maximum likelihood inference for the joint estimation of the time distributions and latent regression parameters of the model. We consider a high-dimensional setting, with datasets containing a large number of biomedical covariates. We therefore penalize the negative log-likelihood by the Elastic-Net, which leads to a sparse parameterization of the model. Inference is achieved using an efficient Quasi-Newton Expectation Maximization (QNEM) algorithm, for which we provide convergence properties. We then propose a score by assessing the patients risk of early adverse event. The statistical performance of the method is examined on an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, and finally illustrated on three genetic datasets with high-dimensional covariates. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, namely both the CURE and Cox proportional hazards models for this task, both in terms of C-index and AUC(t).	C-mix: a high dimensional mixture model for censored durations, with  applications to genetic data
1504.06026v1	We consider the problem of estimating undirected triangle-free graphs of high dimensional distributions. Triangle-free graphs form a rich graph family which allows arbitrary loopy structures but 3-cliques. For inferential tractability, we propose a graphical Fermat's principle to regularize the distribution family. Such principle enforces the existence of a distribution-dependent pseudo-metric such that any two nodes have a smaller distance than that of two other nodes who have a geodesic path include these two nodes. Guided by this principle, we show that a greedy strategy is able to recover the true graph. The resulting algorithm only requires a pairwise distance matrix as input and is computationally even more efficient than calculating the minimum spanning tree. We consider graph estimation problems under different settings, including discrete and nonparametric distribution families. Thorough numerical results are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.	Graphical Fermat's Principle and Triangle-Free Graph Estimation
1110.4713v1	Latent Dirichlet Allocation models discrete data as a mixture of discrete distributions, using Dirichlet beliefs over the mixture weights. We study a variation of this concept, in which the documents' mixture weight beliefs are replaced with squashed Gaussian distributions. This allows documents to be associated with elements of a Hilbert space, admitting kernel topic models (KTM), modelling temporal, spatial, hierarchical, social and other structure between documents. The main challenge is efficient approximate inference on the latent Gaussian. We present an approximate algorithm cast around a Laplace approximation in a transformed basis. The KTM can also be interpreted as a type of Gaussian process latent variable model, or as a topic model conditional on document features, uncovering links between earlier work in these areas.	Kernel Topic Models
1011.1026v1	The performance of the Lasso is well understood under the assumptions of the standard linear model with homoscedastic noise. However, in several applications, the standard model does not describe the important features of the data. This paper examines how the Lasso performs on a non-standard model that is motivated by medical imaging applications. In these applications, the variance of the noise scales linearly with the expectation of the observation. Like all heteroscedastic models, the noise terms in this Poisson-like model are \textit{not} independent of the design matrix. More specifically, this paper studies the sign consistency of the Lasso under a sparse Poisson-like model. In addition to studying sufficient conditions for the sign consistency of the Lasso estimate, this paper also gives necessary conditions for sign consistency. Both sets of conditions are comparable to results for the homoscedastic model, showing that when a measure of the signal to noise ratio is large, the Lasso performs well on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data. Simulations reveal that the Lasso performs equally well in terms of model selection performance on both Poisson-like data and homoscedastic data (with properly scaled noise variance), across a range of parameterizations. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the Lasso is robust to the Poisson-like heteroscedastic noise.	The Lasso under Heteroscedasticity
1709.02702v1	The ability of many powerful machine learning algorithms to deal with large data sets without compromise is often hampered by computationally expensive linear algebra tasks, of which calculating the log determinant is a canonical example. In this paper we demonstrate the optimality of Maximum Entropy methods in approximating such calculations. We prove the equivalence between mean value constraints and sample expectations in the big data limit, that Covariance matrix eigenvalue distributions can be completely defined by moment information and that the reduction of the self entropy of a maximum entropy proposal distribution, achieved by adding more moments reduces the KL divergence between the proposal and true eigenvalue distribution. We empirically verify our results on a variety of SparseSuite matrices and establish best practices.	Entropic Determinants
0907.2337v2	Network models have been popular for modeling and representing complex relationships and dependencies between observed variables. When data comes from a dynamic stochastic process, a single static network model cannot adequately capture transient dependencies, such as, gene regulatory dependencies throughout a developmental cycle of an organism. Kolar et al (2010b) proposed a method based on kernel-smoothing l1-penalized logistic regression for estimating time-varying networks from nodal observations collected from a time-series of observational data. In this paper, we establish conditions under which the proposed method consistently recovers the structure of a time-varying network. This work complements previous empirical findings by providing sound theoretical guarantees for the proposed estimation procedure. For completeness, we include numerical simulations in the paper.	Sparsistent Estimation of Time-Varying Discrete Markov Random Fields
1407.7969v1	We introduce a means of automating machine learning (ML) for big data tasks, by performing scalable stochastic Bayesian optimisation of ML algorithm parameters and hyper-parameters. More often than not, the critical tuning of ML algorithm parameters has relied on domain expertise from experts, along with laborious hand-tuning, brute search or lengthy sampling runs. Against this background, Bayesian optimisation is finding increasing use in automating parameter tuning, making ML algorithms accessible even to non-experts. However, the state of the art in Bayesian optimisation is incapable of scaling to the large number of evaluations of algorithm performance required to fit realistic models to complex, big data. We here describe a stochastic, sparse, Bayesian optimisation strategy to solve this problem, using many thousands of noisy evaluations of algorithm performance on subsets of data in order to effectively train algorithms for big data. We provide a comprehensive benchmarking of possible sparsification strategies for Bayesian optimisation, concluding that a Nystrom approximation offers the best scaling and performance for real tasks. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement over the state of the art in tuning the parameters of a Gaussian Process time series prediction task on real, big data.	Automated Machine Learning on Big Data using Stochastic Algorithm Tuning
1611.07161v1	We consider the problem of estimating the expected value of information (the knowledge gradient) for Bayesian learning problems where the belief model is nonlinear in the parameters. Our goal is to maximize some metric, while simultaneously learning the unknown parameters of the nonlinear belief model, by guiding a sequential experimentation process which is expensive. We overcome the problem of computing the expected value of an experiment, which is computationally intractable, by using a sampled approximation, which helps to guide experiments but does not provide an accurate estimate of the unknown parameters. We then introduce a resampling process which allows the sampled model to adapt to new information, exploiting past experiments. We show theoretically that the method converges asymptotically to the true parameters, while simultaneously maximizing our metric. We show empirically that the process exhibits rapid convergence, yielding good results with a very small number of experiments.	Optimal Learning for Stochastic Optimization with Nonlinear Parametric  Belief Models
1802.07167v1	Deep neural networks are a powerful technique for learning complex functions from data. However, their appeal in real-world applications can be hindered by an inability to quantify the uncertainty of predictions. In this paper, the generation of prediction intervals (PI) for quantifying uncertainty in regression tasks is considered. It is axiomatic that high-quality PIs should be as narrow as possible, whilst capturing a specified portion of data. In this paper we derive a loss function directly from this high-quality principle that requires no distributional assumption. We show how its form derives from a likelihood principle, that it can be used with gradient descent, and that in ensembled form, model uncertainty is accounted for. This remedies limitations of a popular model developed on the same high-quality principle. Experiments are conducted on ten regression benchmark datasets. The proposed quality-driven (QD) method is shown to outperform current state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods, reducing average PI width by around 10%.	High-Quality Prediction Intervals for Deep Learning: A  Distribution-Free, Ensembled Approach
1012.3880v1	We propose a novel application of the Simultaneous Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (S-OMP) procedure for sparsistant variable selection in ultra-high dimensional multi-task regression problems. Screening of variables, as introduced in \cite{fan08sis}, is an efficient and highly scalable way to remove many irrelevant variables from the set of all variables, while retaining all the relevant variables. S-OMP can be applied to problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and once the number of variables is reduced to a manageable size, a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to identify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize relatedness of multiple outputs to perform fast screening of relevant variables. As our main theoretical contribution, we prove that, asymptotically, S-OMP is guaranteed to reduce an ultra-high number of variables to below the sample size without losing true relevant variables. We also provide formal evidence that a modified Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can be used to efficiently determine the number of iterations in S-OMP. We further provide empirical evidence on the benefit of variable selection using multiple regression outputs jointly, as opposed to performing variable selection for each output separately. The finite sample performance of S-OMP is demonstrated on extensive simulation studies, and on a genetic association mapping problem. $Keywords$ Adaptive Lasso; Greedy forward regression; Orthogonal matching pursuit; Multi-output regression; Multi-task learning; Simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit; Sure screening; Variable selection	Ultra-high Dimensional Multiple Output Learning With Simultaneous  Orthogonal Matching Pursuit: A Sure Screening Approach
1607.05974v1	We propose a method that performs anomaly detection and localisation within heterogeneous data using a pairwise undirected mixed graphical model. The data are a mixture of categorical and quantitative variables, and the model is learned over a dataset that is supposed not to contain any anomaly. We then use the model over temporal data, potentially a data stream, using a version of the two-sided CUSUM algorithm. The proposed decision statistic is based on a conditional likelihood ratio computed for each variable given the others. Our results show that this function allows to detect anomalies variable by variable, and thus to localise the variables involved in the anomalies more precisely than univariate methods based on simple marginals.	Anomaly Detection and Localisation using Mixed Graphical Models
1710.05115v3	The superposition of temporal point processes has been studied for many years, although the usefulness of such models for practical applications has not be fully developed. We investigate superposed Hawkes process as an important class of such models, with properties studied in the framework of least squares estimation. The superposition of Hawkes processes is demonstrated to be beneficial for tightening the upper bound of excess risk under certain conditions, and we show the feasibility of the benefit in typical situations. The usefulness of superposed Hawkes processes is verified on synthetic data, and its potential to solve the cold-start problem of recommendation systems is demonstrated on real-world data.	Benefits from Superposed Hawkes Processes
1712.00520v1	Identifying altered pathways that are associated with specific cancer types can potentially bring a significant impact on cancer patient treatment. Accurate identification of such key altered pathways information can be used to develop novel therapeutic agents as well as to understand the molecular mechanisms of various types of cancers better. Tri-matrix factorization is an efficient tool to learn associations between two different entities (e.g., cancer types and pathways in our case) from data. To successfully apply tri-matrix factorization methods to biomedical problems, biological prior knowledge such as pathway databases or protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, should be taken into account in the factorization model. However, it is not straightforward in the Bayesian setting even though Bayesian methods are more appealing than point estimate methods, such as a maximum likelihood or a maximum posterior method, in the sense that they calculate distributions over variables and are robust against overfitting. We propose a Bayesian (semi-)nonnegative matrix factorization model for human cancer genomic data, where the biological prior knowledge represented by a pathway database and a PPI network is taken into account in the factorization model through a finite dependent Beta-Bernoulli prior. We tested our method on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and found that the pathways identified by our method can be used as a prognostic biomarkers for patient subgroup identification.	Bayesian Semi-nonnegative Tri-matrix Factorization to Identify Pathways  Associated with Cancer Types
1606.02321v1	The vast majority of the neural network literature focuses on predicting point values for a given set of response variables, conditioned on a feature vector. In many cases we need to model the full joint conditional distribution over the response variables rather than simply making point predictions. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to such conditional density estimation (CDE): Multiscale Nets (MSNs) and CDE Trend Filtering. Multiscale nets transform the CDE regression task into a hierarchical classification task by decomposing the density into a series of half-spaces and learning boolean probabilities of each split. CDE Trend Filtering applies a k-th order graph trend filtering penalty to the unnormalized logits of a multinomial classifier network, with each edge in the graph corresponding to a neighboring point on a discretized version of the density. We compare both methods against plain multinomial classifier networks and mixture density networks (MDNs) on a simulated dataset and three real-world datasets. The results suggest the two methods are complementary: MSNs work well in a high-data-per-feature regime and CDE-TF is well suited for few-samples-per-feature scenarios where overfitting is a primary concern.	Better Conditional Density Estimation for Neural Networks
1709.04135v2	In the multiple linear regression setting, we propose a general framework, termed weighted orthogonal components regression (WOCR), which encompasses many known methods as special cases, including ridge regression and principal components regression. WOCR makes use of the monotonicity inherent in orthogonal components to parameterize the weight function. The formulation allows for efficient determination of tuning parameters and hence is computationally advantageous. Moreover, WOCR offers insights for deriving new better variants. Specifically, we advocate weighting components based on their correlations with the response, which leads to enhanced predictive performance. Both simulated studies and real data examples are provided to assess and illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods.	Weighted Orthogonal Components Regression Analysis
1509.08588v3	The estimation of probabilities of network edges from the observed adjacency matrix has important applications to predicting missing links and network denoising. It has usually been addressed by estimating the graphon, a function that determines the matrix of edge probabilities, but this is ill-defined without strong assumptions on the network structure. Here we propose a novel computationally efficient method, based on neighborhood smoothing to estimate the expectation of the adjacency matrix directly, without making the structural assumptions that graphon estimation requires. The neighborhood smoothing method requires little tuning, has a competitive mean-squared error rate, and outperforms many benchmark methods on link prediction in simulated and real networks.

1310.0532v4	Vertex clustering in a stochastic blockmodel graph has wide applicability and has been the subject of extensive research. In thispaper, we provide a short proof that the adjacency spectral embedding can be used to obtain perfect clustering for the stochastic blockmodel and the degree-corrected stochastic blockmodel. We also show an analogous result for the more general random dot product graph model.	Perfect Clustering for Stochastic Blockmodel Graphs via Adjacency  Spectral Embedding
1703.06476v2	We investigate coresets - succinct, small summaries of large data sets - so that solutions found on the summary are provably competitive with solution found on the full data set. We provide an overview over the state-of-the-art in coreset construction for machine learning. In Section 2, we present both the intuition behind and a theoretically sound framework to construct coresets for general problems and apply it to $k$-means clustering. In Section 3 we summarize existing coreset construction algorithms for a variety of machine learning problems such as maximum likelihood estimation of mixture models, Bayesian non-parametric models, principal component analysis, regression and general empirical risk minimization.

1403.7267v1	The motivation of this work is to improve the performance of standard stacking approaches or ensembles, which are composed of simple, heterogeneous base models, through the integration of the generation and selection stages for regression problems. We propose two extensions to the standard stacking approach. In the first extension we combine a set of standard stacking approaches into an ensemble of ensembles using a two-step ensemble learning in the regression setting. The second extension consists of two parts. In the initial part a diversity mechanism is injected into the original training data set, systematically generating different training subsets or partitions, and corresponding ensembles of ensembles. In the final part after measuring the quality of the different partitions or ensembles, a max-min rule-based selection algorithm is used to select the most appropriate ensemble/partition on which to make the final prediction. We show, based on experiments over a broad range of data sets, that the second extension performs better than the best of the standard stacking approaches, and is as good as the oracle of databases, which has the best base model selected by cross-validation for each data set. In addition to that, the second extension performs better than two state-of-the-art ensemble methods for regression, and it is as good as a third state-of-the-art ensemble method.	Systematic Ensemble Learning for Regression
1004.5265v3	In this paper we consider sparse and identifiable linear latent variable (factor) and linear Bayesian network models for parsimonious analysis of multivariate data. We propose a computationally efficient method for joint parameter and model inference, and model comparison. It consists of a fully Bayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component delta-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a stochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we call SLIM (Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling), is validated and bench-marked on artificial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in spirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in inference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison. Experimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with comparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic search strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identifiability), which is an explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d. linear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM (Sparse Non-linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for correlations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the temporal and/or spatial data. The source code and scripts are available from this http URL	Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate Modeling
1701.04532v1	Gaussian processes (GPs) have been proven to be powerful tools in various areas of machine learning. However, there are very few applications of GPs in the scenario of multi-view learning. In this paper, we present a new GP model for multi-view learning. Unlike existing methods, it combines multiple views by regularizing marginal likelihood with the consistency among the posterior distributions of latent functions from different views. Moreover, we give a general point selection scheme for multi-view learning and improve the proposed model by this criterion. Experimental results on multiple real world data sets have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model and witnessed the performance improvement through employing this novel point selection scheme.

1411.2005v1	Gaussian process classification is a popular method with a number of appealing properties. We show how to scale the model within a variational inducing point framework, outperforming the state of the art on benchmark datasets. Importantly, the variational formulation can be exploited to allow classification in problems with millions of data points, as we demonstrate in experiments.	Scalable Variational Gaussian Process Classification
0909.5026v2	We propose a new optimization algorithm for Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) called SpicyMKL, which is applicable to general convex loss functions and general types of regularization. The proposed SpicyMKL iteratively solves smooth minimization problems. Thus, there is no need of solving SVM, LP, or QP internally. SpicyMKL can be viewed as a proximal minimization method and converges super-linearly. The cost of inner minimization is roughly proportional to the number of active kernels. Therefore, when we aim for a sparse kernel combination, our algorithm scales well against increasing number of kernels. Moreover, we give a general block-norm formulation of MKL that includes non-sparse regularizations, such as elastic-net and \ellp -norm regularizations. Extending SpicyMKL, we propose an efficient optimization method for the general regularization framework. Experimental results show that our algorithm is faster than existing methods especially when the number of kernels is large (> 1000).	SpicyMKL
1411.3803v1	Classical stochastic gradient methods are well suited for minimizing expected-value objective functions. However, they do not apply to the minimization of a nonlinear function involving expected values or a composition of two expected-value functions, i.e., problems of the form $\min_x \mathbf{E}_v [f_v\big(\mathbf{E}_w [g_w(x)]\big)]$. In order to solve this stochastic composition problem, we propose a class of stochastic compositional gradient descent (SCGD) algorithms that can be viewed as stochastic versions of quasi-gradient method. SCGD update the solutions based on noisy sample gradients of $f_v,g_{w}$ and use an auxiliary variable to track the unknown quantity $\mathbf{E}_w[g_w(x)]$. We prove that the SCGD converge almost surely to an optimal solution for convex optimization problems, as long as such a solution exists. The convergence involves the interplay of two iterations with different time scales. For nonsmooth convex problems, the SCGD achieve a convergence rate of $O(k^{-1/4})$ in the general case and $O(k^{-2/3})$ in the strongly convex case, after taking $k$ samples. For smooth convex problems, the SCGD can be accelerated to converge at a rate of $O(k^{-2/7})$ in the general case and $O(k^{-4/5})$ in the strongly convex case. For nonconvex problems, we prove that any limit point generated by SCGD is a stationary point, for which we also provide the convergence rate analysis. Indeed, the stochastic setting where one wants to optimize compositions of expected-value functions is very common in practice. The proposed SCGD methods find wide applications in learning, estimation, dynamic programming, etc.	Stochastic Compositional Gradient Descent: Algorithms for Minimizing  Compositions of Expected-Value Functions
1207.3399v2	We compute the expected value of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to various fundamental statistical models with respect to canonical priors on the probability simplex. We obtain closed formulas for the expected model approximation errors, depending on the dimension of the models and the cardinalities of their sample spaces. For the uniform prior, the expected divergence from any model containing the uniform distribution is bounded by a constant $1-\gamma$, and for the models that we consider, this bound is approached if the state space is very large and the models' dimension does not grow too fast. For Dirichlet priors the expected divergence is bounded in a similar way, if the concentration parameters take reasonable values. These results serve as reference values for more complicated statistical models.	Scaling of Model Approximation Errors and Expected Entropy Distances
1112.4863v4	"We study the basic problem of robust subspace recovery. That is, we assume a data set that some of its points are sampled around a fixed subspace and the rest of them are spread in the whole ambient space, and we aim to recover the fixed underlying subspace. We first estimate ""robust inverse sample covariance"" by solving a convex minimization procedure; we then recover the subspace by the bottom eigenvectors of this matrix (their number correspond to the number of eigenvalues close to 0). We guarantee exact subspace recovery under some conditions on the underlying data. Furthermore, we propose a fast iterative algorithm, which linearly converges to the matrix minimizing the convex problem. We also quantify the effect of noise and regularization and discuss many other practical and theoretical issues for improving the subspace recovery in various settings. When replacing the sum of terms in the convex energy function (that we minimize) with the sum of squares of terms, we obtain that the new minimizer is a scaled version of the inverse sample covariance (when exists). We thus interpret our minimizer and its subspace (spanned by its bottom eigenvectors) as robust versions of the empirical inverse covariance and the PCA subspace respectively. We compare our method with many other algorithms for robust PCA on synthetic and real data sets and demonstrate state-of-the-art speed and accuracy."	A Novel M-Estimator for Robust PCA
1209.0367v2	"Given two graphs, the graph matching problem is to align the two vertex sets so as to minimize the number of adjacency disagreements between the two graphs. The seeded graph matching problem is the graph matching problem when we are first given a partial alignment that we are tasked with completing. In this paper, we modify the state-of-the-art approximate graph matching algorithm ""FAQ"" of Vogelstein et al. (2015) to make it a fast approximate seeded graph matching algorithm, adapt its applicability to include graphs with differently sized vertex sets, and extend the algorithm so as to provide, for each individual vertex, a nomination list of likely matches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm via simulation and real data experiments; indeed, knowledge of even a few seeds can be extremely effective when our seeded graph matching algorithm is used to recover a naturally existing alignment that is only partially observed."

1703.07596v2	Kernel embeddings of distributions and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), the resulting distance between distributions, are useful tools for fully nonparametric two-sample testing and learning on distributions. However, it is rarely that all possible differences between samples are of interest -- discovered differences can be due to different types of measurement noise, data collection artefacts or other irrelevant sources of variability. We propose distances between distributions which encode invariance to additive symmetric noise, aimed at testing whether the assumed true underlying processes differ. Moreover, we construct invariant features of distributions, leading to learning algorithms robust to the impairment of the input distributions with symmetric additive noise.

1802.08598v2	Predictive models that generalize well under distributional shift are often desirable and sometimes crucial to building robust and reliable machine learning applications. We focus on distributional shift that arises in causal inference from observational data and in unsupervised domain adaptation. We pose both of these problems as prediction under a shift in design. Popular methods for overcoming distributional shift make unrealistic assumptions such as having a well-specified model or knowing the policy that gave rise to the observed data. Other methods are hindered by their need for a pre-specified metric for comparing observations, or by poor asymptotic properties. We devise a bound on the generalization error under design shift, incorporating both representation learning and sample re-weighting. Based on the bound, we propose an algorithmic framework that does not require any of the above assumptions and which is asymptotically consistent. We empirically study the new framework using two synthetic datasets, and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to previous methods.	Learning Weighted Representations for Generalization Across Designs
1706.05136v1	We present a probabilistic framework for overlapping community discovery and link prediction for relational data, given as a graph. The proposed framework has: (1) a deep architecture which enables us to infer multiple layers of latent features/communities for each node, providing superior link prediction performance on more complex networks and better interpretability of the latent features; and (2) a regression model which allows directly conditioning the node latent features on the side information available in form of node attributes. Our framework handles both (1) and (2) via a clean, unified model, which enjoys full local conjugacy via data augmentation, and facilitates efficient inference via closed form Gibbs sampling. Moreover, inference cost scales in the number of edges which is attractive for massive but sparse networks. Our framework is also easily extendable to model weighted networks with count-valued edges. We compare with various state-of-the-art methods and report results, both quantitative and qualitative, on several benchmark data sets.

This bias reduction schema is shown to correspond operationally to the $L_2$ Boosting algorithm and provides a new statistical interpretation for $L_2$ Boosting. We analyze the behavior of the Boosting algorithm applied to common smoothers $S$ which we show depend on the spectrum of $I-S$. We present examples of common smoother for which Boosting generates a divergent sequence. The statistical interpretation suggest combining algorithm with an appropriate stopping rule for the iterative procedure. Finally we illustrate the practical finite sample performances of the iterative smoother via a simulation study. simulations.	Recursive Bias Estimation and $L_2$ Boosting
1706.06691v1	"Machine-learned models are often described as ""black boxes"". In many real-world applications however, models may have to sacrifice predictive power in favour of human-interpretability. When this is the case, feature engineering becomes a crucial task, which requires significant and time-consuming human effort. Whilst some features are inherently static, representing properties that cannot be influenced (e.g., the age of an individual), others capture characteristics that could be adjusted (e.g., the daily amount of carbohydrates taken). Nonetheless, once a model is learned from the data, each prediction it makes on new instances is irreversible - assuming every instance to be a static point located in the chosen feature space. There are many circumstances however where it is important to understand (i) why a model outputs a certain prediction on a given instance, (ii) which adjustable features of that instance should be modified, and finally (iii) how to alter such a prediction when the mutated instance is input back to the model. In this paper, we present a technique that exploits the internals of a tree-based ensemble classifier to offer recommendations for transforming true negative instances into positively predicted ones. We demonstrate the validity of our approach using an online advertising application. First, we design a Random Forest classifier that effectively separates between two types of ads: low (negative) and high (positive) quality ads (instances). Then, we introduce an algorithm that provides recommendations that aim to transform a low quality ad (negative instance) into a high quality one (positive instance). Finally, we evaluate our approach on a subset of the active inventory of a large ad network, Yahoo Gemini."	Interpretable Predictions of Tree-based Ensembles via Actionable Feature  Tweaking
1703.08031v1	We present the first treatment of the arc length of the Gaussian Process (GP) with more than a single output dimension. GPs are commonly used for tasks such as trajectory modelling, where path length is a crucial quantity of interest. Previously, only paths in one dimension have been considered, with no theoretical consideration of higher dimensional problems. We fill the gap in the existing literature by deriving the moments of the arc length for a stationary GP with multiple output dimensions. A new method is used to derive the mean of a one-dimensional GP over a finite interval, by considering the distribution of the arc length integrand. This technique is used to derive an approximate distribution over the arc length of a vector valued GP in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by moment matching the distribution. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical derivations.	Distribution of Gaussian Process Arc Lengths
1006.0868v2	The Gaussian process (GP) is a popular way to specify dependencies between random variables in a probabilistic model. In the Bayesian framework the covariance structure can be specified using unknown hyperparameters. Integrating over these hyperparameters considers different possible explanations for the data when making predictions. This integration is often performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. However, with non-Gaussian observations standard hyperparameter sampling approaches require careful tuning and may converge slowly. In this paper we present a slice sampling approach that requires little tuning while mixing well in both strong- and weak-data regimes.

1704.05820v2	We study the problem of interactively learning a binary classifier using noisy labeling and pairwise comparison oracles, where the comparison oracle answers which one in the given two instances is more likely to be positive. Learning from such oracles has multiple applications where obtaining direct labels is harder but pairwise comparisons are easier, and the algorithm can leverage both types of oracles. In this paper, we attempt to characterize how the access to an easier comparison oracle helps in improving the label and total query complexity. We show that the comparison oracle reduces the learning problem to that of learning a threshold function. We then present an algorithm that interactively queries the label and comparison oracles and we characterize its query complexity under Tsybakov and adversarial noise conditions for the comparison and labeling oracles. Our lower bounds show that our label and total query complexity is almost optimal.	Noise-Tolerant Interactive Learning from Pairwise Comparisons

1502.05313v2	Annealed importance sampling (AIS) is a common algorithm to estimate partition functions of useful stochastic models. One important problem for obtaining accurate AIS estimates is the selection of an annealing schedule. Conventionally, an annealing schedule is often determined heuristically or is simply set as a linearly increasing sequence. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the optimal schedule by deriving a functional that dominates the AIS estimation error and by numerically minimizing this functional. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed algorithm mostly outperforms conventional scheduling schemes with large quantization numbers.	Variational Optimization of Annealing Schedules
1711.08160v1	While most classical approaches to Granger causality detection repose upon linear time series assumptions, many interactions in neuroscience and economics applications are nonlinear. We develop an approach to nonlinear Granger causality detection using multilayer perceptrons where the input to the network is the past time lags of all series and the output is the future value of a single series. A sufficient condition for Granger non-causality in this setting is that all of the outgoing weights of the input data, the past lags of a series, to the first hidden layer are zero. For estimation, we utilize a group lasso penalty to shrink groups of input weights to zero. We also propose a hierarchical penalty for simultaneous Granger causality and lag estimation. We validate our approach on simulated data from both a sparse linear autoregressive model and the sparse and nonlinear Lorenz-96 model.

1108.4988v2	Concave regularization methods provide natural procedures for sparse recovery. However, they are difficult to analyze in the high dimensional setting. Only recently a few sparse recovery results have been established for some specific local solutions obtained via specialized numerical procedures. Still, the fundamental relationship between these solutions such as whether they are identical or their relationship to the global minimizer of the underlying nonconvex formulation is unknown. The current paper fills this conceptual gap by presenting a general theoretical framework showing that under appropriate conditions, the global solution of nonconvex regularization leads to desirable recovery performance; moreover, under suitable conditions, the global solution corresponds to the unique sparse local solution, which can be obtained via different numerical procedures. Under this unified framework, we present an overview of existing results and discuss their connections. The unified view of this work leads to a more satisfactory treatment of concave high dimensional sparse estimation procedures, and serves as guideline for developing further numerical procedures for concave regularization.

1009.5736v4	A nonparametric kernel-based method for realizing Bayes' rule is proposed, based on representations of probabilities in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Probabilities are uniquely characterized by the mean of the canonical map to the RKHS. The prior and conditional probabilities are expressed in terms of RKHS functions of an empirical sample: no explicit parametric model is needed for these quantities. The posterior is likewise an RKHS mean of a weighted sample. The estimator for the expectation of a function of the posterior is derived, and rates of consistency are shown. Some representative applications of the kernel Bayes' rule are presented, including Baysian computation without likelihood and filtering with a nonparametric state-space model.	Kernel Bayes' rule
1709.05501v4	Automatic Chemical Design leverages recent advances in deep generative modelling to provide a framework for performing continuous optimization of molecular properties. Although the provision of a continuous representation for prospective lead drug candidates has opened the door to hitherto inaccessible tools of mathematical optimization, some challenges remain for the design process. One known pathology is the model's tendency to decode invalid molecular structures. The goal of this thesis is to test the hypothesis that the origin of this pathology is rooted in the current formulation of Bayesian optimization. Recasting the optimization procedure as a constrained Bayesian optimization problem results in novel drug compounds produced by the model consistently ranking in the 100th percentile of the distribution over training set scores.

1607.00084v2	The problem of finding overlapping communities in networks has gained much attention recently. Optimization-based approaches use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or variants, but the global optimum cannot be provably attained in general. Model-based approaches, such as the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel or MMSB (Airoldi et al., 2008), use parameters for each node to specify the overlapping communities, but standard inference techniques cannot guarantee consistency. We link the two approaches, by (a) establishing sufficient conditions for the symmetric NMF optimization to have a unique solution under MMSB, and (b) proposing a computationally efficient algorithm called GeoNMF that is provably optimal and hence consistent for a broad parameter regime. We demonstrate its accuracy on both simulated and real-world datasets.	On Mixed Memberships and Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations
1403.5177v1	We present a supervised-learning algorithm from graph data (a set of graphs) for arbitrary twice-differentiable loss functions and sparse linear models over all possible subgraph features. To date, it has been shown that under all possible subgraph features, several types of sparse learning, such as Adaboost, LPBoost, LARS/LASSO, and sparse PLS regression, can be performed. Particularly emphasis is placed on simultaneous learning of relevant features from an infinite set of candidates. We first generalize techniques used in all these preceding studies to derive an unifying bounding technique for arbitrary separable functions. We then carefully use this bounding to make block coordinate gradient descent feasible over infinite subgraph features, resulting in a fast converging algorithm that can solve a wider class of sparse learning problems over graph data. We also empirically study the differences from the existing approaches in convergence property, selected subgraph features, and search-space sizes. We further discuss several unnoticed issues in sparse learning over all possible subgraph features.	Sparse Learning over Infinite Subgraph Features

1105.2054v2	Boosting is a popular way to derive powerful learners from simpler hypothesis classes. Following previous work (Mason et al., 1999; Friedman, 2000) on general boosting frameworks, we analyze gradient-based descent algorithms for boosting with respect to any convex objective and introduce a new measure of weak learner performance into this setting which generalizes existing work. We present the weak to strong learning guarantees for the existing gradient boosting work for strongly-smooth, strongly-convex objectives under this new measure of performance, and also demonstrate that this work fails for non-smooth objectives. To address this issue, we present new algorithms which extend this boosting approach to arbitrary convex loss functions and give corresponding weak to strong convergence results. In addition, we demonstrate experimental results that support our analysis and demonstrate the need for the new algorithms we present.	Generalized Boosting Algorithms for Convex Optimization
1704.00541v2	To ensure interpretability of extracted sources in tensor decomposition, we introduce in this paper a dictionary-based tensor canonical polyadic decomposition which enforces one factor to belong exactly to a known dictionary. A new formulation of sparse coding is proposed which enables high dimensional tensors dictionary-based canonical polyadic decomposition. The benefits of using a dictionary in tensor decomposition models are explored both in terms of parameter identifiability and estimation accuracy. Performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated on the decomposition of simulated data and the unmixing of hyperspectral images.	Dictionary-based Tensor Canonical Polyadic Decomposition
1106.4199v1	We present the group fused Lasso for detection of multiple change-points shared by a set of co-occurring one-dimensional signals. Change-points are detected by approximating the original signals with a constraint on the multidimensional total variation, leading to piecewise-constant approximations. Fast algorithms are proposed to solve the resulting optimization problems, either exactly or approximately. Conditions are given for consistency of both algorithms as the number of signals increases, and empirical evidence is provided to support the results on simulated and array comparative genomic hybridization data.

1512.02543v1	We investigate a class of feature allocation models that generalize the Indian buffet process and are parameterized by Gibbs-type random measures. Two existing classes are contained as special cases: the original two-parameter Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Dirichlet process, and the stable (or three-parameter) Indian buffet process, corresponding to the Pitman-Yor process. Asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs-type partitions, such as power laws holding for the number of latent clusters, translates into analogous characteristics for this class of Gibbs-type feature allocation models. Despite containing several different distinct subclasses, the properties of Gibbs-type partitions allow us to develop a black-box procedure for posterior inference within any subclass of models. Through numerical experiments, we compare and contrast a few of these subclasses and highlight the utility of varying power-law behaviors in the latent features.	Gibbs-type Indian buffet processes
1507.05781v1	Adaptive Monte Carlo schemes developed over the last years usually seek to ensure ergodicity of the sampling process in line with MCMC tradition. This poses constraints on what is possible in terms of adaptation. In the general case ergodicity can only be guaranteed if adaptation is diminished at a certain rate. Importance Sampling approaches offer a way to circumvent this limitation and design sampling algorithms that keep adapting. Here I present a gradient informed variant of SMC (and its special case Population Monte Carlo) for static problems.	Gradient Importance Sampling
1605.07870v1	Dictionary learning is a cutting-edge area in imaging processing, that has recently led to state-of-the-art results in many signal processing tasks. The idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a learned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis. Determining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for both precision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionary learning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novel regularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method can simultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionary size. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with the non-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples are presented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.	Simultaneous Sparse Dictionary Learning and Pruning
1802.05447v1	In this paper we propose a new algorithm for streaming principal component analysis. With limited memory, small devices cannot store all the samples in the high-dimensional regime. Streaming principal component analysis aims to find the $k$-dimensional subspace which can explain the most variation of the $d$-dimensional data points that come into memory sequentially. In order to deal with large $d$ and large $N$ (number of samples), most streaming PCA algorithms update the current model using only the incoming sample and then dump the information right away to save memory. However the information contained in previously streamed data could be useful. Motivated by this idea, we develop a new streaming PCA algorithm called History PCA that achieves this goal. By using $O(Bd)$ memory with $B\approx 10$ being the block size, our algorithm converges much faster than existing streaming PCA algorithms. By changing the number of inner iterations, the memory usage can be further reduced to $O(d)$ while maintaining a comparable convergence speed. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm along with the rate of convergence. We also demonstrate on synthetic and real world data sets that our algorithm compares favorably with other state-of-the-art streaming PCA methods in terms of the convergence speed and performance.

1110.4531v4	We propose a method called ideal regression for approximating an arbitrary system of polynomial equations by a system of a particular type. Using techniques from approximate computational algebraic geometry, we show how we can solve ideal regression directly without resorting to numerical optimization. Ideal regression is useful whenever the solution to a learning problem can be described by a system of polynomial equations. As an example, we demonstrate how to formulate Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA), a source separation problem, in terms of ideal regression, which also yields a consistent estimator for SSA. We then compare this estimator in simulations with previous optimization-based approaches for SSA.	Regression for sets of polynomial equations
1701.00481v2	We study the problem of estimating low-rank matrices from linear measurements (a.k.a., matrix sensing) through nonconvex optimization. We propose an efficient stochastic variance reduced gradient descent algorithm to solve a nonconvex optimization problem of matrix sensing. Our algorithm is applicable to both noisy and noiseless settings. In the case with noisy observations, we prove that our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate up to the minimax optimal statistical error. And in the noiseless setting, our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown low-rank matrix and achieves exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. Most notably, the overall computational complexity of our proposed algorithm, which is defined as the iteration complexity times per iteration time complexity, is lower than the state-of-the-art algorithms based on gradient descent. Experiments on synthetic data corroborate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms.	Stochastic Variance-reduced Gradient Descent for Low-rank Matrix  Recovery from Linear Measurements
1406.0597v3	Numbers and numerical vectors account for a large portion of data. However, recently the amount of string data generated has increased dramatically. Consequently, classifying string data is a common problem in many fields. The most widely used approach to this problem is to convert strings into numerical vectors using string kernels and subsequently apply a support vector machine that works in a numerical vector space. However, this non-one-to-one conversion involves a loss of information and makes it impossible to evaluate, using probability theory, the generalization error of a learning machine, considering that the given data to train and test the machine are strings generated according to probability laws. In this study, we approach this classification problem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings. To evaluate the generalization error of such a classifier theoretically, probability theory for strings is required. Therefore, we first extend a limit theorem on the asymptotic behavior of a consensus sequence of strings, which is the counterpart of the mean of numerical vectors, as demonstrated in the probability theory on a metric space of strings developed by one of the authors and his colleague in a previous study [18]. Using the obtained result, we then demonstrate that our learning machine classifies strings in an asymptotically optimal manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of our machine in practical data analysis by applying it to predicting protein--protein interactions using amino acid sequences.

1606.08105v1	When observations are organized into groups where commonalties exist amongst them, the dependent random measures can be an ideal choice for modeling. One of the propositions of the dependent random measures is that the atoms of the posterior distribution are shared amongst groups, and hence groups can borrow information from each other. When normalized dependent random measures prior with independent increments are applied, we can derive appropriate exchangeable probability partition function (EPPF), and subsequently also deduce its inference algorithm given any mixture model likelihood. We provide all necessary derivation and solution to this framework. For demonstration, we used mixture of Gaussians likelihood in combination with a dependent structure constructed by linear combinations of CRMs. Our experiments show superior performance when using this framework, where the inferred values including the mixing weights and the number of clusters both respond appropriately to the number of completely random measure used.

1412.7260v2	High-dimensional data often lie in low-dimensional subspaces corresponding to different classes they belong to. Finding sparse representations of data points in a dictionary built using the collection of data helps to uncover low-dimensional subspaces and address problems such as clustering, classification, subset selection and more. In this paper, we address the problem of recovering sparse representations for noisy data points in a dictionary whose columns correspond to corrupted data lying close to a union of subspaces. We consider a constrained $\ell_1$-minimization and study conditions under which the solution of the proposed optimization satisfies the approximate subspace-sparse recovery condition. More specifically, we show that each noisy data point, perturbed from a subspace by a noise of the magnitude of $\varepsilon$, will be reconstructed using data points from the same subspace with a small error of the order of $O(\varepsilon)$ and that the coefficients corresponding to data points in other subspaces will be sufficiently small, \ie, of the order of $O(\varepsilon)$. We do not impose any randomness assumption on the arrangement of subspaces or distribution of data points in each subspace. Our framework is based on a novel generalization of the null-space property to the setting where data lie in multiple subspaces, the number of data points in each subspace exceeds the dimension of the subspace, and all data points are corrupted by noise. Moreover, assuming a random distribution for data points, we further show that coefficients from the desired support not only reconstruct a given point with high accuracy, but also have sufficiently large values, \ie, of the order of $O(1)$.

1711.08451v1	The estimation of optimal treatment regimes is of considerable interest to precision medicine. In this work, we propose a causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to estimate the optimal treatment regime. The method roots in the framework of causal inference, and estimates the causal treatment effects within the nearest neighborhood. Although the method is simple, it possesses nice theoretical properties. We show that the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime is universally consistent. That is, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime will eventually learn the optimal treatment regime as the sample size increases. We also establish its convergence rate. However, the causal $k$-nearest neighbor regime may suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. performance deteriorates as dimensionality increases. To alleviate this problem, we develop an adaptive causal $k$-nearest neighbor method to perform metric selection and variable selection simultaneously. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated in simulation studies and in an analysis of a chronic depression clinical trial.	Causal nearest neighbor rules for optimal treatment regimes
1802.04725v2	We consider the learning of multi-agent Hawkes processes, a model containing multiple Hawkes processes with shared endogenous impact functions and different exogenous intensities. In the framework of stochastic maximum likelihood estimation, we explore the associated risk bound. Further, we consider the superposition of Hawkes processes within the model, and demonstrate that under certain conditions such an operation is beneficial for tightening the risk bound. Accordingly, we propose a stochastic optimization algorithm assisted with a diversity-driven superposition strategy, achieving better learning results with improved convergence properties. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on synthetic data, and its potential to solve the cold-start problem of sequential recommendation systems is demonstrated on real-world data.

1408.2714v2	We prove new fast learning rates for the one-vs-all multiclass plug-in classifiers trained either from exponentially strongly mixing data or from data generated by a converging drifting distribution. These are two typical scenarios where training data are not iid. The learning rates are obtained under a multiclass version of Tsybakov's margin assumption, a type of low-noise assumption, and do not depend on the number of classes. Our results are general and include a previous result for binary-class plug-in classifiers with iid data as a special case. In contrast to previous works for least squares SVMs under the binary-class setting, our results retain the optimal learning rate in the iid case.

1205.2653v1	The choice of the kernel is critical to the success of many learning algorithms but it is typically left to the user. Instead, the training data can be used to learn the kernel by selecting it out of a given family, such as that of non-negative linear combinations of p base kernels, constrained by a trace or L1 regularization. This paper studies the problem of learning kernels with the same family of kernels but with an L2 regularization instead, and for regression problems. We analyze the problem of learning kernels with ridge regression. We derive the form of the solution of the optimization problem and give an efficient iterative algorithm for computing that solution. We present a novel theoretical analysis of the problem based on stability and give learning bounds for orthogonal kernels that contain only an additive term O(pp/m) when compared to the standard kernel ridge regression stability bound. We also report the results of experiments indicating that L1 regularization can lead to modest improvements for a small number of kernels, but to performance degradations in larger-scale cases. In contrast, L2 regularization never degrades performance and in fact achieves significant improvements with a large number of kernels.	L2 Regularization for Learning Kernels
1307.0293v3	"The vector autoregressive (VAR) model is a powerful tool in modeling complex time series and has been exploited in many fields. However, fitting high dimensional VAR model poses some unique challenges: On one hand, the dimensionality, caused by modeling a large number of time series and higher order autoregressive processes, is usually much higher than the time series length; On the other hand, the temporal dependence structure in the VAR model gives rise to extra theoretical challenges. In high dimensions, one popular approach is to assume the transition matrix is sparse and fit the VAR model using the ""least squares"" method with a lasso-type penalty. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative way in estimating the VAR model. The main idea is, via exploiting the temporal dependence structure, to formulate the estimating problem into a linear program. There is instant advantage for the proposed approach over the lasso-type estimators: The estimation equation can be decomposed into multiple sub-equations and accordingly can be efficiently solved in a parallel fashion. In addition, our method brings new theoretical insights into the VAR model analysis. So far the theoretical results developed in high dimensions (e.g., Song and Bickel (2011) and Kock and Callot (2012)) mainly pose assumptions on the design matrix of the formulated regression problems. Such conditions are indirect about the transition matrices and not transparent. In contrast, our results show that the operator norm of the transition matrices plays an important role in estimation accuracy. We provide explicit rates of convergence for both estimation and prediction. In addition, we provide thorough experiments on both synthetic and real-world equity data to show that there are empirical advantages of our method over the lasso-type estimators in both parameter estimation and forecasting."

Both methods are based on a relaxation of the marginal likelihood obtained by considering the density of the variables represented by a vertex $v$ of $G$ and a neighborhood. The two methods differ by the size of the neighborhood of $v$. We show that the estimates are consistent and that those obtained with the larger neighborhood have smaller asymptotic variance than the ones obtained through the smaller neighborhood.

1612.04875v1	Spectral analysis of neighborhood graphs is one of the most widely used techniques for exploratory data analysis, with applications ranging from machine learning to social sciences. In such applications, it is typical to first encode relationships between the data samples using an appropriate similarity function. Popular neighborhood construction techniques such as k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are known to be very sensitive to the choice of parameters, and more importantly susceptible to noise and varying densities. In this paper, we propose the use of quantile analysis to obtain local scale estimates for neighborhood graph construction. To this end, we build an auto-encoding neural network approach for inferring conditional quantiles of a similarity function, which are subsequently used to obtain robust estimates of the local scales. In addition to being highly resilient to noise or outlying data, the proposed approach does not require extensive parameter tuning unlike several existing methods. Using applications in spectral clustering and single-example label propagation, we show that the proposed neighborhood graphs outperform existing locally scaled graph construction approaches.

1204.1795v1	We consider to learn a causal ordering of variables in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model called LiNGAM. Several existing methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But, the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions actually are violated. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data.	Estimation of causal orders in a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model: a  method robust against latent confounders
1203.3485v1	There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the traditional HMM. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markovianity, which has been developed in the parametric setting to allow construction of highly interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations. In this paper we introduce the explicitduration HDP-HSMM and develop posterior sampling algorithms for efficient inference in both the direct-assignment and weak-limit approximation settings. We demonstrate the utility of the model and our inference methods on synthetic data as well as experiments on a speaker diarization problem and an example of learning the patterns in Morse code.	The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Semi-Markov Model
1603.02160v2	Kernel methods are one of the mainstays of machine learning, but the problem of kernel learning remains challenging, with only a few heuristics and very little theory. This is of particular importance in methods based on estimation of kernel mean embeddings of probability measures. For characteristic kernels, which include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely determines its probability measure, so it can be used to design a powerful statistical testing framework, which includes nonparametric two-sample and independence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be very sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To address this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel mean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaussian process prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean embedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form posterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely related to recently proposed shrinkage estimators for kernel mean embeddings, while the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various possible applications. Critically for the purposes of kernel learning, our model gives a simple, closed form marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data given the kernel hyperparameters. This marginal pseudolikelihood can either be optimized to inform the hyperparameter choice or fully Bayesian inference can be used.	Bayesian Learning of Kernel Embeddings
1506.08776v2	Kernel methods are ubiquitous tools in machine learning. However, there is often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori. Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a $N \times N$ Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of $N$ instances. The computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct application of kernel methods on large datasets, and makes kernel learning especially difficult. In this paper we introduce Bayesian nonparmetric kernel-learning (BaNK), a generic, data-driven framework for scalable learning of kernels. BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral distribution of random frequencies allowing it to both learn kernels and scale to large datasets. We show that this framework can be used for large scale regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that BaNK outperforms several other scalable approaches for kernel learning on a variety of real world datasets.	Bayesian Nonparametric Kernel-Learning
1106.1622v1	We address the problem of minimizing a convex function over the space of large matrices with low rank. While this optimization problem is hard in general, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm and derive its formal approximation guarantees. Each iteration of the algorithm involves (approximately) finding the left and right singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular value of a certain matrix, which can be calculated in linear time. This leads to an algorithm which can scale to large matrices arising in several applications such as matrix completion for collaborative filtering and robust low rank matrix approximation.	Large-Scale Convex Minimization with a Low-Rank Constraint
1004.2468v1	Pattern recognition is a central topic in Learning Theory with numerous applications such as voice and text recognition, image analysis, computer diagnosis. The statistical set-up in classification is the following: we are given an i.i.d. training set $(X_{1},Y_{1}),... (X_{n},Y_{n})$ where $X_{i}$ represents a feature and $Y_{i}\in \{0,1\}$ is a label attached to that feature. The underlying joint distribution of $(X,Y)$ is unknown, but we can learn about it from the training set and we aim at devising low error classifiers $f:X\to Y$ used to predict the label of new incoming features. Here we solve a quantum analogue of this problem, namely the classification of two arbitrary unknown qubit states. Given a number of `training' copies from each of the states, we would like to `learn' about them by performing a measurement on the training set. The outcome is then used to design mesurements for the classification of future systems with unknown labels. We find the asymptotically optimal classification strategy and show that typically, it performs strictly better than a plug-in strategy based on state estimation. The figure of merit is the excess risk which is the difference between the probability of error and the probability of error of the optimal measurement when the states are known, that is the Helstrom measurement. We show that the excess risk has rate $n^{-1}$ and compute the exact constant of the rate.	Quantum learning: optimal classification of qubit states
1706.01865v1	Performance of machine learning approaches depends strongly on the choice of misfit penalty, and correct choice of penalty parameters, such as the threshold of the Huber function. These parameters are typically chosen using expert knowledge, cross-validation, or black-box optimization, which are time consuming for large-scale applications. We present a principled, data-driven approach to simultaneously learn the model pa- rameters and the misfit penalty parameters. We discuss theoretical properties of these joint inference problems, and develop algorithms for their solution. We show synthetic examples of automatic parameter tuning for piecewise linear-quadratic (PLQ) penalties, and use the approach to develop a self-tuning robust PCA formulation for background separation.	Shape Parameter Estimation
1301.1919v1	We propose an approach to multivariate nonparametric regression that generalizes reduced rank regression for linear models. An additive model is estimated for each dimension of a $q$-dimensional response, with a shared $p$-dimensional predictor variable. To control the complexity of the model, we employ a functional form of the Ky-Fan or nuclear norm, resulting in a set of function estimates that have low rank. Backfitting algorithms are derived and justified using a nonparametric form of the nuclear norm subdifferential. Oracle inequalities on excess risk are derived that exhibit the scaling behavior of the procedure in the high dimensional setting. The methods are illustrated on gene expression data.

1004.0314v2	The present contribution suggests the use of a multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm as a visualization tool for manifold-valued elements. A visualization tool of this kind is useful in signal processing and machine learning whenever learning/adaptation algorithms insist on high-dimensional parameter manifolds.

0811.3499v1	The most direct way to express arbitrary dependencies in datasets is to estimate the joint distribution and to apply afterwards the argmax-function to obtain the mode of the corresponding conditional distribution. This method is in practice difficult, because it requires a global optimization of a complicated function, the joint distribution by fixed input variables. This article proposes a method for finding global maxima if the joint distribution is modeled by a kernel density estimation. Some experiments show advantages and shortcomings of the resulting regression method in comparison to the standard Nadaraya-Watson regression technique, which approximates the optimum by the expectation value.

1202.6228v6	In this work, we propose a PAC-Bayes bound for the generalization risk of the Gibbs classifier in the multi-class classification framework. The novelty of our work is the critical use of the confusion matrix of a classifier as an error measure; this puts our contribution in the line of work aiming at dealing with performance measure that are richer than mere scalar criterion such as the misclassification rate. Thanks to very recent and beautiful results on matrix concentration inequalities, we derive two bounds showing that the true confusion risk of the Gibbs classifier is upper-bounded by its empirical risk plus a term depending on the number of training examples in each class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PAC-Bayes bounds based on confusion matrices.	PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound on Confusion Matrix for Multi-Class  Classification
1201.0610v1	Metric learning makes it plausible to learn distances for complex distributions of data from labeled data. However, to date, most metric learning methods are based on a single Mahalanobis metric, which cannot handle heterogeneous data well. Those that learn multiple metrics throughout the space have demonstrated superior accuracy, but at the cost of computational efficiency. Here, we take a new angle to the metric learning problem and learn a single metric that is able to implicitly adapt its distance function throughout the feature space. This metric adaptation is accomplished by using a random forest-based classifier to underpin the distance function and incorporate both absolute pairwise position and standard relative position into the representation. We have implemented and tested our method against state of the art global and multi-metric methods on a variety of data sets. Overall, the proposed method outperforms both types of methods in terms of accuracy (consistently ranked first) and is an order of magnitude faster than state of the art multi-metric methods (16x faster in the worst case).

1511.03405v1	Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations of Gaussian processes (GPs) and are formally equivalent to neural networks with multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are probabilistic and non-parametric and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to generalise, and provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than alternative deep models. The focus of this paper is scalable approximate Bayesian learning of these networks. The paper develops a novel and efficient extension of probabilistic backpropagation, a state-of-the-art method for training Bayesian neural networks, that can be used to train DGPs. The new method leverages a recently proposed method for scaling Expectation Propagation, called stochastic Expectation Propagation. The method is able to automatically discover useful input warping, expansion or compression, and it is therefore is a flexible form of Bayesian kernel design. We demonstrate the success of the new method for supervised learning on several real-world datasets, showing that it typically outperforms GP regression and is never much worse.

1802.01301v1	Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Computer systems can assist in melanoma detection, but are not widespread in clinical practice. In 2016, an open challenge in classification of dermoscopic images of skin lesions was announced. A training set of 900 images with corresponding class labels and semi-automatic/manual segmentation masks was released for the challenge. An independent test set of 379 images was used to rank the participants. This article demonstrates the impact of ranking criteria, segmentation method and classifier, and highlights the clinical perspective. We compare five different measures for diagnostic accuracy by analysing the resulting ranking of the computer systems in the challenge. Choice of performance measure had great impact on the ranking. Systems that were ranked among the top three for one measure, dropped to the bottom half when changing performance measure. Nevus Doctor, a computer system previously developed by the authors, was used to investigate the impact of segmentation and classifier. The unexpected small impact of automatic versus semi-automatic/manual segmentation suggests that improvements of the automatic segmentation method w.r.t. resemblance to semi-automatic/manual segmentation will not improve diagnostic accuracy substantially. A small set of similar classification algorithms are used to investigate the impact of classifier on the diagnostic accuracy. The variability in diagnostic accuracy for different classifier algorithms was larger than the variability for segmentation methods, and suggests a focus for future investigations. From a clinical perspective, the misclassification of a melanoma as benign has far greater cost than the misclassification of a benign lesion. For computer systems to have clinical impact, their performance should be ranked by a high-sensitivity measure.

1703.10827v1	Objective: In this work, we perform margin assessment of human breast tissue from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images using deep neural networks (DNNs). This work simulates an intraoperative setting for breast cancer lumpectomy. Methods: To train the DNNs, we use both the state-of-the-art methods (Weight Decay and DropOut) and a newly introduced regularization method based on function norms. Commonly used methods can fail when only a small database is available. The use of a function norm introduces a direct control over the complexity of the function with the aim of diminishing the risk of overfitting. Results: As neither the code nor the data of previous results are publicly available, the obtained results are compared with reported results in the literature for a conservative comparison. Moreover, our method is applied to locally collected data on several data configurations. The reported results are the average over the different trials. Conclusion: The experimental results show that the use of DNNs yields significantly better results than other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, G-mean and Matthews correlation coefficient. Function norm regularization yielded higher and more robust results than competing methods. Significance: We have demonstrated a system that shows high promise for (partially) automated margin assessment of human breast tissue, Equal error rate (EER) is reduced from approximately 12\% (the lowest reported in the literature) to 5\%\,--\,a 58\% reduction. The method is computationally feasible for intraoperative application (less than 2 seconds per image).

1102.1492v4	Unsupervised discovery of latent representations, in addition to being useful for density modeling, visualisation and exploratory data analysis, is also increasingly important for learning features relevant to discriminative tasks. Autoencoders, in particular, have proven to be an effective way to learn latent codes that reflect meaningful variations in data. A continuing challenge, however, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for particular tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are invariant to irrelevant transformations of the data. The most common way of introducing such problem-specific guidance in autoencoders has been through the incorporation of a parametric component that ties the latent representation to the label information. In this work, we argue that a preferable approach relies instead on a nonparametric guidance mechanism. Conceptually, it ensures that there exists a function that can predict the label information, without explicitly instantiating that function. The superiority of this guidance mechanism is confirmed on two datasets. In particular, this approach is able to incorporate invariance information (lighting, elevation, etc.) from the small NORB object recognition dataset and yields state-of-the-art performance for a single layer, non-convolutional network.

1202.3451v1	Consider observation data, comprised of n observation vectors with values on a set of attributes. This gives us n points in attribute space. Having data structured as a tree, implied by having our observations embedded in an ultrametric topology, offers great advantage for proximity searching. If we have preprocessed data through such an embedding, then an observation's nearest neighbor is found in constant computational time, i.e. O(1) time. A further powerful approach is discussed in this work: the inducing of a hierarchy, and hence a tree, in linear computational time, i.e. O(n) time for n observations. It is with such a basis for proximity search and best match that we can address the burgeoning problems of processing very large, and possibly also very high dimensional, data sets.

1010.5496v1	We study the computational capacity of a model neuron, the Tempotron, which classifies sequences of spikes by linear-threshold operations. We use statistical mechanics and extreme value theory to derive the capacity of the system in random classification tasks. In contrast to its static analog, the Perceptron, the Tempotron's solutions space consists of a large number of small clusters of weight vectors. The capacity of the system per synapse is finite in the large size limit and weakly diverges with the stimulus duration relative to the membrane and synaptic time constants.

1104.0896v5	Objective: Modelling the associations from high-throughput experimental molecular data has provided unprecedented insights into biological pathways and signalling mechanisms. Graphical models and networks have especially proven to be useful abstractions in this regard. Ad-hoc thresholds are often used in conjunction with structure learning algorithms to determine significant associations. The present study overcomes this limitation by proposing a statistically-motivated approach for identifying significant associations in a network. Methods and Materials: A new method that identifies significant associations in graphical models by estimating the threshold minimising the $L_{\mathrm{1}}$ norm between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the observed edge confidences and those of its asymptotic counterpart is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on popular synthetic data sets as well as publicly available experimental molecular data corresponding to gene and protein expression profiles. Results: The improved performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated across the synthetic data sets using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as performance metrics. The results are also demonstrated across varying sample sizes and three different structure learning algorithms with widely varying assumptions. In all cases, the proposed approach has specificity and accuracy close to 1, while sensitivity increases linearly in the logarithm of the sample size. The estimated threshold systematically outperforms common ad-hoc ones in terms of sensitivity while maintaining comparable levels of specificity and accuracy. Networks from experimental data sets are reconstructed accurately with respect to the results from the original papers.	On Identifying Significant Edges in Graphical Models of Molecular  Networks
1704.02162v2	Super-resolution is a classical problem in image processing, with numerous applications to remote sensing image enhancement. Here, we address the super-resolution of irregularly-sampled remote sensing images. Using an optimal interpolation as the low-resolution reconstruction, we explore locally-adapted multimodal convolutional models and investigate different dictionary-based decompositions, namely based on principal component analysis (PCA), sparse priors and non-negativity constraints. We consider an application to the reconstruction of sea surface height (SSH) fields from two information sources, along-track altimeter data and sea surface temperature (SST) data. The reported experiments demonstrate the relevance of the proposed model, especially locally-adapted parametrizations with non-negativity constraints, to outperform optimally-interpolated reconstructions.

1705.06408v1	We consider the problem of efficient randomized dimensionality reduction with norm-preservation guarantees. Specifically we prove data-dependent Johnson-Lindenstrauss-type geometry preservation guarantees for Ho's random subspace method: When data satisfy a mild regularity condition -- the extent of which can be estimated by sampling from the data -- then random subspace approximately preserves the Euclidean geometry of the data with high probability. Our guarantees are of the same order as those for random projection, namely the required dimension for projection is logarithmic in the number of data points, but have a larger constant term in the bound which depends upon this regularity. A challenging situation is when the original data have a sparse representation, since this implies a very large projection dimension is required: We show how this situation can be improved for sparse binary data by applying an efficient `densifying' preprocessing, which neither changes the Euclidean geometry of the data nor requires an explicit matrix-matrix multiplication. We corroborate our theoretical findings with experiments on both dense and sparse high-dimensional datasets from several application domains.

1111.3404v1	Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a fundamental measure of the generalization capacity of learning algorithms. However, apart from a few special cases, it is hard or impossible to calculate analytically. Vapnik et al. [10] proposed a technique for estimating the VC dimension empirically. While their approach behaves well in simulations, it could not be used to bound the generalization risk of classifiers, because there were no bounds for the estimation error of the VC dimension itself. We rectify this omission, providing high probability concentration results for the proposed estimator and deriving corresponding generalization bounds.	Estimated VC dimension for risk bounds
1610.09490v1	Regularised canonical correlation analysis was recently extended to more than two sets of variables by the multiblock method Regularised generalised canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA). Further, Sparse GCCA (SGCCA) was proposed to address the issue of variable selection. However, for technical reasons, the variable selection offered by SGCCA was restricted to a covariance link between the blocks (i.e., with $\tau=1$). One of the main contributions of this paper is to go beyond the covariance link and to propose an extension of SGCCA for the full RGCCA model (i.e., with $\tau\in[0, 1]$). In addition, we propose an extension of SGCCA that exploits structural relationships between variables within blocks. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that allows structured and sparsity-inducing penalties to be included in the RGCCA optimisation problem. The proposed multiblock method is illustrated on a real three-block high-grade glioma data set, where the aim is to predict the location of the brain tumours, and on a simulated data set, where the aim is to illustrate the method's ability to reconstruct the true underlying weight vectors.

1410.5522v1	The classical approach to inverse problems is based on the optimization of a misfit function. Despite its computational appeal, such an approach suffers from many shortcomings, e.g., non-uniqueness of solutions, modeling prior knowledge, etc. The Bayesian formalism to inverse problems avoids most of the difficulties encountered by the optimization approach, albeit at an increased computational cost. In this work, we use information theoretic arguments to cast the Bayesian inference problem in terms of an optimization problem. The resulting scheme combines the theoretical soundness of fully Bayesian inference with the computational efficiency of a simple optimization.	Variational Reformulation of Bayesian Inverse Problems
1511.04402v2	"We compute approximate solutions to L0 regularized linear regression using L1 regularization, also known as the Lasso, as an initialization step. Our algorithm, the Lass-0 (""Lass-zero""), uses a computationally efficient stepwise search to determine a locally optimal L0 solution given any L1 regularization solution. We present theoretical results of consistency under orthogonality and appropriate handling of redundant features. Empirically, we use synthetic data to demonstrate that Lass-0 solutions are closer to the true sparse support than L1 regularization models. Additionally, in real-world data Lass-0 finds more parsimonious solutions than L1 regularization while maintaining similar predictive accuracy."	Lass-0: sparse non-convex regression by local search
1802.00045v1	Gaussian process (GP) models provide a powerful tool for prediction but are computationally prohibitive using large data sets. In such scenarios, one has to resort to approximate methods. We derive an approximation based on a composite likelihood approach using a general belief updating framework, which leads to a recursive computation of the predictor as well as of learning the hyper-parameters. We then provide an analysis of the derived composite GP model in predictive and information-theoretic terms. Finally, we evaluate the approximation with both synthetic data and a real-world application.	Composite Gaussian Processes: Scalable Computation and Performance  Analysis
1506.04158v3	This paper presents a novel spectral algorithm with additive clustering designed to identify overlapping communities in networks. The algorithm is based on geometric properties of the spectrum of the expected adjacency matrix in a random graph model that we call stochastic blockmodel with overlap (SBMO). An adaptive version of the algorithm, that does not require the knowledge of the number of hidden communities, is proved to be consistent under the SBMO when the degrees in the graph are (slightly more than) logarithmic. The algorithm is shown to perform well on simulated data and on real-world graphs with known overlapping communities.

1202.3750v1	Reinforcement learning addresses the dilemma between exploration to find profitable actions and exploitation to act according to the best observations already made. Bandit problems are one such class of problems in stateless environments that represent this explore/exploit situation. We propose a learning algorithm for bandit problems based on fractional expectation of rewards acquired. The algorithm is theoretically shown to converge on an eta-optimal arm and achieve O(n) sample complexity. Experimental results show the algorithm incurs substantially lower regrets than parameter-optimized eta-greedy and SoftMax approaches and other low sample complexity state-of-the-art techniques.

1410.6959v2	$L_1$ regularized logistic regression has now become a workhorse of data mining and bioinformatics: it is widely used for many classification problems, particularly ones with many features. However, $L_1$ regularization typically selects too many features and that so-called false positives are unavoidable. In this paper, we demonstrate and analyze an aggregation method for sparse logistic regression in high dimensions. This approach linearly combines the estimators from a suitable set of logistic models with different underlying sparsity patterns and can balance the predictive ability and model interpretability. Numerical performance of our proposed aggregation method is then investigated using simulation studies. We also analyze a published genome-wide case-control dataset to further evaluate the usefulness of the aggregation method in multilocus association mapping.

1802.04908v1	Modeling complex conditional distributions is critical in a variety of settings. Despite a long tradition of research into conditional density estimation, current methods employ either simple parametric forms or are difficult to learn in practice. This paper employs normalising flows as a flexible likelihood model and presents an efficient method for fitting them to complex densities. These estimators must trade-off between modeling distributional complexity, functional complexity and heteroscedasticity without overfitting. We recognize these trade-offs as modeling decisions and develop a Bayesian framework for placing priors over these conditional density estimators using variational Bayesian neural networks. We evaluate this method on several small benchmark regression datasets, on some of which it obtains state of the art performance. Finally, we apply the method to two spatial density modeling tasks with over 1 million datapoints using the New York City yellow taxi dataset and the Chicago crime dataset.

1709.08915v1	We consider the fundamental problem of inferring the causal direction between two univariate numeric random variables $X$ and $Y$ from observational data. The two-variable case is especially difficult to solve since it is not possible to use standard conditional independence tests between the variables. To tackle this problem, we follow an information theoretic approach based on Kolmogorov complexity and use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to provide a practical solution. In particular, we propose a compression scheme to encode local and global functional relations using MDL-based regression. We infer $X$ causes $Y$ in case it is shorter to describe $Y$ as a function of $X$ than the inverse direction. In addition, we introduce Slope, an efficient linear-time algorithm that through thorough empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real world data we show outperforms the state of the art by a wide margin.

1010.3320v2	The group lasso is a penalized regression method, used in regression problems where the covariates are partitioned into groups to promote sparsity at the group level. Existing methods for finding the group lasso estimator either use gradient projection methods to update the entire coefficient vector simultaneously at each step, or update one group of coefficients at a time using an inexact line search to approximate the optimal value for the group of coefficients when all other groups' coefficients are fixed. We present a new method of computation for the group lasso in the linear regression case, the Single Line Search (SLS) algorithm, which operates by computing the exact optimal value for each group (when all other coefficients are fixed) with one univariate line search. We perform simulations demonstrating that the SLS algorithm is often more efficient than existing computational methods. We also extend the SLS algorithm to the sparse group lasso problem via the Signed Single Line Search (SSLS) algorithm, and give theoretical results to support both algorithms.

1204.0047v2	The problem of optimizing unknown costly-to-evaluate functions has been studied for a long time in the context of Bayesian Optimization. Algorithms in this field aim to find the optimizer of the function by asking only a few function evaluations at locations carefully selected based on a posterior model. In this paper, we assume the unknown function is Lipschitz continuous. Leveraging the Lipschitz property, we propose an algorithm with a distinct exploration phase followed by an exploitation phase. The exploration phase aims to select samples that shrink the search space as much as possible. The exploitation phase then focuses on the reduced search space and selects samples closest to the optimizer. Considering the Expected Improvement (EI) as a baseline, we empirically show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms EI.

1412.7983v2	Recent studies in the literature have paid much attention to the sparsity in linear classification tasks. One motivation of imposing sparsity assumption on the linear discriminant direction is to rule out the noninformative features, making hardly contribution to the classification problem. Most of those work were focused on the scenarios of binary classification. In the presence of multi-class data, preceding researches recommended individually pairwise sparse linear discriminant analysis(LDA). However, further sparsity should be explored. In this paper, an estimator of grouped LASSO type is proposed to take advantage of sparsity for multi-class data. It enjoys appealing non-asymptotic properties which allows insignificant correlations among features. This estimator exhibits superior capability on both simulated and real data.

1102.3975v2	We study the problem of selecting a subset of k random variables from a large set, in order to obtain the best linear prediction of another variable of interest. This problem can be viewed in the context of both feature selection and sparse approximation. We analyze the performance of widely used greedy heuristics, using insights from the maximization of submodular functions and spectral analysis. We introduce the submodularity ratio as a key quantity to help understand why greedy algorithms perform well even when the variables are highly correlated. Using our techniques, we obtain the strongest known approximation guarantees for this problem, both in terms of the submodularity ratio and the smallest k-sparse eigenvalue of the covariance matrix. We further demonstrate the wide applicability of our techniques by analyzing greedy algorithms for the dictionary selection problem, and significantly improve the previously known guarantees. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets; the experiments show that the submodularity ratio is a stronger predictor of the performance of greedy algorithms than other spectral parameters.

1606.01869v3	Clustering is one of the most important unsupervised problems in machine learning and statistics. Among many existing algorithms, kernel k-means has drawn much research attention due to its ability to find non-linear cluster boundaries and its inherent simplicity. There are two main approaches for kernel k-means: SVD of the kernel matrix and convex relaxations. Despite the attention kernel clustering has received both from theoretical and applied quarters, not much is known about robustness of the methods. In this paper we first introduce a semidefinite programming relaxation for the kernel clustering problem, then prove that under a suitable model specification, both the K-SVD and SDP approaches are consistent in the limit, albeit SDP is strongly consistent, i.e. achieves exact recovery, whereas K-SVD is weakly consistent, i.e. the fraction of misclassified nodes vanish.

1107.2462v2	Machine learning approaches to multi-label document classification have to date largely relied on discriminative modeling techniques such as support vector machines. A drawback of these approaches is that performance rapidly drops off as the total number of labels and the number of labels per document increase. This problem is amplified when the label frequencies exhibit the type of highly skewed distributions that are often observed in real-world datasets. In this paper we investigate a class of generative statistical topic models for multi-label documents that associate individual word tokens with different labels. We investigate the advantages of this approach relative to discriminative models, particularly with respect to classification problems involving large numbers of relatively rare labels. We compare the performance of generative and discriminative approaches on document labeling tasks ranging from datasets with several thousand labels to datasets with tens of labels. The experimental results indicate that probabilistic generative models can achieve competitive multi-label classification performance compared to discriminative methods, and have advantages for datasets with many labels and skewed label frequencies.

1705.05197v1	We propose a set of convex low rank inducing norms for a coupled matrices and tensors (hereafter coupled tensors), which shares information between matrices and tensors through common modes. More specifically, we propose a mixture of the overlapped trace norm and the latent norms with the matrix trace norm, and then, we propose a new completion algorithm based on the proposed norms. A key advantage of the proposed norms is that it is convex and can find a globally optimal solution, while existing methods for coupled learning are non-convex. Furthermore, we analyze the excess risk bounds of the completion model regularized by our proposed norms which show that our proposed norms can exploit the low rankness of coupled tensors leading to better bounds compared to uncoupled norms. Through synthetic and real-world data experiments, we show that the proposed completion algorithm compares favorably with existing completion algorithms.	Convex Coupled Matrix and Tensor Completion
1312.4719v1	In this paper we study nonconvex penalization using Bernstein functions. Since the Bernstein function is concave and nonsmooth at the origin, it can induce a class of nonconvex functions for high-dimensional sparse estimation problems. We derive a threshold function based on the Bernstein penalty and give its mathematical properties in sparsity modeling. We show that a coordinate descent algorithm is especially appropriate for penalized regression problems with the Bernstein penalty. Additionally, we prove that the Bernstein function can be defined as the concave conjugate of a $\varphi$-divergence and develop a conjugate maximization algorithm for finding the sparse solution. Finally, we particularly exemplify a family of Bernstein nonconvex penalties based on a generalized Gamma measure and conduct empirical analysis for this family.

1711.08042v2	Most research on the interpretability of machine learning systems focuses on the development of a more rigorous notion of interpretability. I suggest that a better understanding of the deficiencies of the intuitive notion of interpretability is needed as well. I show that visualization enables but also impedes intuitive interpretability, as it presupposes two levels of technical pre-interpretation: dimensionality reduction and regularization. Furthermore, I argue that the use of positive concepts to emulate the distributed semantic structure of machine learning models introduces a significant human bias into the model. As a consequence, I suggest that, if intuitive interpretability is needed, singular representations of internal model states should be avoided.	"""I know it when I see it"".

1202.3774v1	In this paper, we study the risk bounds for samples independently drawn from an infinitely divisible (ID) distribution. In particular, based on a martingale method, we develop two deviation inequalities for a sequence of random variables of an ID distribution with zero Gaussian component. By applying the deviation inequalities, we obtain the risk bounds based on the covering number for the ID distribution. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic convergence of the risk bound derived from one of the two deviation inequalities and show that the convergence rate of the bound is faster than the result for the generic i.i.d. empirical process (Mendelson, 2003).	Risk Bounds for Infinitely Divisible Distribution
1011.5270v2	Many clustering schemes are defined by optimizing an objective function defined on the partitions of the underlying set of a finite metric space. In this paper, we construct a framework for studying what happens when we instead impose various structural conditions on the clustering schemes, under the general heading of functoriality. Functoriality refers to the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorems analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which for example one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We obtain a full classification of all clustering schemes satisfying a condition we refer to as excisiveness. The classification can be changed by varying the notion of maps of finite metric spaces. The conditions occur naturally when one considers clustering as the statistical version of the geometric notion of connected components. By varying the degree of functoriality that one requires from the schemes it is possible to construct richer families of clustering schemes that exhibit sensitivity to density.	Classifying Clustering Schemes
1407.5924v1	Many graph clustering quality functions suffer from a resolution limit, the inability to find small clusters in large graphs. So called resolution-limit-free quality functions do not have this limit. This property was previously introduced for hard clustering, that is, graph partitioning. We investigate the resolution-limit-free property in the context of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for hard and soft graph clustering. To use NMF in the hard clustering setting, a common approach is to assign each node to its highest membership cluster. We show that in this case symmetric NMF is not resolution-limit-free, but that it becomes so when hardness constraints are used as part of the optimization. The resulting function is strongly linked to the Constant Potts Model. In soft clustering, nodes can belong to more than one cluster, with varying degrees of membership. In this setting resolution-limit-free turns out to be too strong a property. Therefore we introduce locality, which roughly states that changing one part of the graph does not affect the clustering of other parts of the graph. We argue that this is a desirable property, provide conditions under which NMF quality functions are local, and propose a novel class of local probabilistic NMF quality functions for soft graph clustering.	Resolution-limit-free and local Non-negative Matrix Factorization  quality functions for graph clustering
1202.3731v1	We address the problem of learning the parameters in graphical models when inference is intractable. A common strategy in this case is to replace the partition function with its Bethe approximation. We show that there exists a regime of empirical marginals where such Bethe learning will fail. By failure we mean that the empirical marginals cannot be recovered from the approximated maximum likelihood parameters (i.e., moment matching is not achieved). We provide several conditions on empirical marginals that yield outer and inner bounds on the set of Bethe learnable marginals. An interesting implication of our results is that there exists a large class of marginals that cannot be obtained as stable fixed points of belief propagation. Taken together our results provide a novel approach to analyzing learning with Bethe approximations and highlight when it can be expected to work or fail.	What Cannot be Learned with Bethe Approximations
1710.06360v2	We consider a novel stochastic multi-armed bandit problem called {\em good arm identification} (GAI), where a good arm is defined as an arm with expected reward greater than or equal to a given threshold. GAI is a pure-exploration problem that a single agent repeats a process of outputting an arm as soon as it is identified as a good one before confirming the other arms are actually not good. The objective of GAI is to minimize the number of samples for each process. We find that GAI faces a new kind of dilemma, the {\em exploration-exploitation dilemma of confidence}, which is different difficulty from the best arm identification. As a result, an efficient design of algorithms for GAI is quite different from that for the best arm identification. We derive a lower bound on the sample complexity of GAI that is tight up to the logarithmic factor $\mathrm{O}(\log \frac{1}{\delta})$ for acceptance error rate $\delta$. We also develop an algorithm whose sample complexity almost matches the lower bound. We also confirm experimentally that our proposed algorithm outperforms naive algorithms in synthetic settings based on a conventional bandit problem and clinical trial researches for rheumatoid arthritis.	Good Arm Identification via Bandit Feedback
1510.07786v2	Estimating the strength of dependency between two variables is fundamental for exploratory analysis and many other applications in data mining. For example: non-linear dependencies between two continuous variables can be explored with the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC); and categorical variables that are dependent to the target class are selected using Gini gain in random forests. Nonetheless, because dependency measures are estimated on finite samples, the interpretability of their quantification and the accuracy when ranking dependencies become challenging. Dependency estimates are not equal to 0 when variables are independent, cannot be compared if computed on different sample size, and they are inflated by chance on variables with more categories. In this paper, we propose a framework to adjust dependency measure estimates on finite samples. Our adjustments, which are simple and applicable to any dependency measure, are helpful in improving interpretability when quantifying dependency and in improving accuracy on the task of ranking dependencies. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the interpretability of MIC when used as a proxy for the amount of noise between variables, and to gain accuracy when ranking variables during the splitting procedure in random forests.	A Framework to Adjust Dependency Measure Estimates for Chance
1207.3649v1	We consider probabilistic multinomial probit classification using Gaussian process (GP) priors. The challenges with the multiclass GP classification are the integration over the non-Gaussian posterior distribution, and the increase of the number of unknown latent variables as the number of target classes grows. Expectation propagation (EP) has proven to be a very accurate method for approximate inference but the existing EP approaches for the multinomial probit GP classification rely on numerical quadratures or independence assumptions between the latent values from different classes to facilitate the computations. In this paper, we propose a novel nested EP approach which does not require numerical quadratures, and approximates accurately all between-class posterior dependencies of the latent values, but still scales linearly in the number of classes. The predictive accuracy of the nested EP approach is compared to Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximations with various benchmark data sets. In the experiments nested EP was the most consistent method with respect to MCMC sampling, but the differences between the compared methods were small if only the classification accuracy is concerned.	Nested Expectation Propagation for Gaussian Process Classification with  a Multinomial Probit Likelihood
1712.02902v1	Bayesian optimization (BO) is a model-based approach for gradient-free black-box function optimization. Typically, BO is powered by a Gaussian process (GP), whose algorithmic complexity is cubic in the number of evaluations. Hence, GP-based BO cannot leverage large amounts of past or related function evaluations, for example, to warm start the BO procedure. We develop a multiple adaptive Bayesian linear regression model as a scalable alternative whose complexity is linear in the number of observations. The multiple Bayesian linear regression models are coupled through a shared feedforward neural network, which learns a joint representation and transfers knowledge across machine learning problems.	Multiple Adaptive Bayesian Linear Regression for Scalable Bayesian  Optimization with Warm Start
1501.04467v1	We consider the setting of linear regression in high dimension. We focus on the problem of constructing adaptive and honest confidence sets for the sparse parameter \theta, i.e. we want to construct a confidence set for theta that contains theta with high probability, and that is as small as possible. The l_2 diameter of a such confidence set should depend on the sparsity S of \theta - the larger S, the wider the confidence set. However, in practice, S is unknown. This paper focuses on constructing a confidence set for \theta which contains \theta with high probability, whose diameter is adaptive to the unknown sparsity S, and which is implementable in practice.	Implementable confidence sets in high dimensional regression
1503.02182v1	Multivariate categorical data occur in many applications of machine learning. One of the main difficulties with these vectors of categorical variables is sparsity. The number of possible observations grows exponentially with vector length, but dataset diversity might be poor in comparison. Recent models have gained significant improvement in supervised tasks with this data. These models embed observations in a continuous space to capture similarities between them. Building on these ideas we propose a Bayesian model for the unsupervised task of distribution estimation of multivariate categorical data. We model vectors of categorical variables as generated from a non-linear transformation of a continuous latent space. Non-linearity captures multi-modality in the distribution. The continuous representation addresses sparsity. Our model ties together many existing models, linking the linear categorical latent Gaussian model, the Gaussian process latent variable model, and Gaussian process classification. We derive inference for our model based on recent developments in sampling based variational inference. We show empirically that the model outperforms its linear and discrete counterparts in imputation tasks of sparse data.

1203.5438v1	We consider the two problems of predicting links in a dynamic graph sequence and predicting functions defined at each node of the graph. In many applications, the solution of one problem is useful for solving the other. Indeed, if these functions reflect node features, then they are related through the graph structure. In this paper, we formulate a hybrid approach that simultaneously learns the structure of the graph and predicts the values of the node-related functions. Our approach is based on the optimization of a joint regularization objective. We empirically test the benefits of the proposed method with both synthetic and real data. The results indicate that joint regularization improves prediction performance over the graph evolution and the node features.

1511.07715v2	Distance-based hierarchical clustering (HC) methods are widely used in unsupervised data analysis but few authors take account of uncertainty in the distance data. We incorporate a statistical model of the uncertainty through corruption or noise in the pairwise distances and investigate the problem of estimating the HC as unknown parameters from measurements. Specifically, we focus on single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) and study its geometry. We prove that under fairly reasonable conditions on the probability distribution governing measurements, SLHC is equivalent to maximum partial profile likelihood estimation (MPPLE) with some of the information contained in the data ignored. At the same time, we show that direct evaluation of SLHC on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of pairwise distances yields a consistent estimator. Consequently, a full MLE is expected to perform better than SLHC in getting the correct HC results for the ground truth metric.	Statistical Properties of the Single Linkage Hierarchical Clustering  Estimator
1602.02485v1	The problem of learning a sparse model is conceptually interpreted as the process of identifying active features/samples and then optimizing the model over them. Recently introduced safe screening allows us to identify a part of non-active features/samples. So far, safe screening has been individually studied either for feature screening or for sample screening. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for safely screening features and samples simultaneously by alternatively iterating feature and sample screening steps. A significant advantage of considering them simultaneously rather than individually is that they have a synergy effect in the sense that the results of the previous safe feature screening can be exploited for improving the next safe sample screening performances, and vice-versa. We first theoretically investigate the synergy effect, and then illustrate the practical advantage through intensive numerical experiments for problems with large numbers of features and samples.

1705.07469v1	We consider the problem of estimation of a low-rank matrix from a limited number of noisy rank-one projections. In particular, we propose two fast, non-convex \emph{proper} algorithms for matrix recovery and support them with rigorous theoretical analysis. We show that the proposed algorithms enjoy linear convergence and that their sample complexity is independent of the condition number of the unknown true low-rank matrix. By leveraging recent advances in low-rank matrix approximation techniques, we show that our algorithms achieve computational speed-ups over existing methods. Finally, we complement our theory with some numerical experiments.	Improved Algorithms for Matrix Recovery from Rank-One Projections
1606.05201v2	"Decoding, ie prediction from brain images or signals, calls for empirical evaluation of its predictive power. Such evaluation is achieved via cross-validation, a method also used to tune decoders' hyper-parameters. This paper is a review on cross-validation procedures for decoding in neuroimaging. It includes a didactic overview of the relevant theoretical considerations. Practical aspects are highlighted with an extensive empirical study of the common decoders in within-and across-subject predictions, on multiple datasets --anatomical and functional MRI and MEG-- and simulations. Theory and experiments outline that the popular "" leave-one-out "" strategy leads to unstable and biased estimates, and a repeated random splits method should be preferred. Experiments outline the large error bars of cross-validation in neuroimaging settings: typical confidence intervals of 10%. Nested cross-validation can tune decoders' parameters while avoiding circularity bias. However we find that it can be more favorable to use sane defaults, in particular for non-sparse decoders."

1110.5847v1	We propose a novel method of introducing structure into existing machine learning techniques by developing structure-based similarity and distance measures. To learn structural information, low-dimensional structure of the data is captured by solving a non-linear, low-rank representation problem. We show that this low-rank representation can be kernelized, has a closed-form solution, allows for separation of independent manifolds, and is robust to noise. From this representation, similarity between observations based on non-linear structure is computed and can be incorporated into existing feature transformations, dimensionality reduction techniques, and machine learning methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets show performance improvements for clustering, and anomaly detection through the use of structural similarity.

0909.1440v1	We present an extension of sparse PCA, or sparse dictionary learning, where the sparsity patterns of all dictionary elements are structured and constrained to belong to a prespecified set of shapes. This \emph{structured sparse PCA} is based on a structured regularization recently introduced by [1]. While classical sparse priors only deal with \textit{cardinality}, the regularization we use encodes higher-order information about the data. We propose an efficient and simple optimization procedure to solve this problem. Experiments with two practical tasks, face recognition and the study of the dynamics of a protein complex, demonstrate the benefits of the proposed structured approach over unstructured approaches.

0811.3619v1	This paper examines from an experimental perspective random forests, the increasingly used statistical method for classification and regression problems introduced by Leo Breiman in 2001. It first aims at confirming, known but sparse, advice for using random forests and at proposing some complementary remarks for both standard problems as well as high dimensional ones for which the number of variables hugely exceeds the sample size. But the main contribution of this paper is twofold: to provide some insights about the behavior of the variable importance index based on random forests and in addition, to propose to investigate two classical issues of variable selection. The first one is to find important variables for interpretation and the second one is more restrictive and try to design a good prediction model. The strategy involves a ranking of explanatory variables using the random forests score of importance and a stepwise ascending variable introduction strategy.

1212.4562v1	We apply information-based complexity analysis to support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, with the goal of a comprehensive continuous algorithmic analysis of such algorithms. This involves complexity measures in which some higher order operations (e.g., certain optimizations) are considered primitive for the purposes of measuring complexity. We consider classes of information operators and algorithms made up of scaled families, and investigate the utility of scaling the complexities to minimize error. We look at the division of statistical learning into information and algorithmic components, at the complexities of each, and at applications to support vector machine (SVM) and more general machine learning algorithms. We give applications to SVM algorithms graded into linear and higher order components, and give an example in biomedical informatics.	A complexity analysis of statistical learning algorithms
1609.01423v3	Principal component analysis (PCA) is an exploratory tool widely used in data analysis to uncover dominant patterns of variability within a population. Despite its ability to represent a data set in a low-dimensional space, the interpretability of PCA remains limited. However, in neuroimaging, it is essential to uncover clinically interpretable phenotypic markers that would account for the main variability in the brain images of a population. Recently, some alternatives to the standard PCA approach, such as Sparse PCA, have been proposed, their aim being to limit the density of the components. Nonetheless, sparsity alone does not entirely solve the interpretability problem, since it may yield scattered and unstable components. We hypothesized that the incorporation of prior information regarding the structure of the data may lead to improved relevance and interpretability of brain patterns. We therefore present a simple extension of the popular PCA framework that adds structured sparsity penalties on the loading vectors in order to identify the few stable regions in the brain images accounting for most of the variability. Such structured sparsity can be obtained by combining l1 and total variation (TV) penalties, where the TV regularization encodes higher order information about the structure of the data. This paper presents the structured sparse PCA (denoted SPCA-TV) optimization framework and its resolution. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of SPCA-TV on three different data sets. The gains of SPCA-TV over unstructured approaches are significant,since SPCA-TV reveals the variability within a data set in the form of intelligible brain patterns that are easy to interpret, and are more stable across different samples.

1711.02226v1	Our goal is to extract meaningful transformations from raw images, such as varying the thickness of lines in handwriting or the lighting in a portrait. We propose an unsupervised approach to learn such transformations by attempting to reconstruct an image from a linear combination of transformations of its nearest neighbors. On handwritten digits and celebrity portraits, we show that even with linear transformations, our method generates visually high-quality modified images. Moreover, since our method is semiparametric and does not model the data distribution, the learned transformations extrapolate off the training data and can be applied to new types of images.

1707.02963v2	Sparsity learning with known grouping structures has received considerable attention due to wide modern applications in high-dimensional data analysis. Although advantages of using group information have been well-studied by shrinkage-based approaches, benefits of group sparsity have not been well-documented for greedy-type methods, which much limits our understanding and use of this important class of methods. In this paper, generalizing from a popular forward-backward greedy approach, we propose a new interactive greedy algorithm for group sparsity learning and prove that the proposed greedy-type algorithm attains the desired benefits of group sparsity under high dimensional settings. An estimation error bound refining other existing methods and a guarantee for group support recovery are also established simultaneously. In addition, an interactive feature is incorporated to allow extra algorithm flexibility without compromise in theoretical properties. The promising use of our proposal is demonstrated through numerical evaluations including a real industrial application in human activity recognition.	An Interactive Greedy Approach to Group Sparsity in High Dimension
1511.04817v1	We present a convex approach to probabilistic segmentation and modeling of time series data. Our approach builds upon recent advances in multivariate total variation regularization, and seeks to learn a separate set of parameters for the distribution over the observations at each time point, but with an additional penalty that encourages the parameters to remain constant over time. We propose efficient optimization methods for solving the resulting (large) optimization problems, and a two-stage procedure for estimating recurring clusters under such models, based upon kernel density estimation. Finally, we show on a number of real-world segmentation tasks, the resulting methods often perform as well or better than existing latent variable models, while being substantially easier to train.	Probabilistic Segmentation via Total Variation Regularization
1309.7821v2	This article proposes Multinomial Probit Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (MPBART) as a multinomial probit extension of BART - Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (Chipman et al (2010)). MPBART is flexible to allow inclusion of predictors that describe the observed units as well as the available choice alternatives. Through two simulation studies and four real data examples, we show that MPBART exhibits very good predictive performance in comparison to other discrete choice and multiclass classification methods. To implement MPBART, we have developed an R package mpbart available freely from CRAN repositories.	MPBART - Multinomial Probit Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
1111.0708v2	Discovering causal relationships is a hard task, often hindered by the need for intervention, and often requiring large amounts of data to resolve statistical uncertainty. However, humans quickly arrive at useful causal relationships. One possible reason is that humans extrapolate from past experience to new, unseen situations: that is, they encode beliefs over causal invariances, allowing for sound generalization from the observations they obtain from directly acting in the world. Here we outline a Bayesian model of causal induction where beliefs over competing causal hypotheses are modeled using probability trees. Based on this model, we illustrate why, in the general case, we need interventions plus constraints on our causal hypotheses in order to extract causal information from our experience.	Bayesian Causal Induction
1511.07367v1	Latent variable time-series models are among the most heavily used tools from machine learning and applied statistics. These models have the advantage of learning latent structure both from noisy observations and from the temporal ordering in the data, where it is assumed that meaningful correlation structure exists across time. A few highly-structured models, such as the linear dynamical system with linear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference procedures (e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the general rule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models is intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling focuses on approximate inference procedures for one particular class of models. Here, we extend recent developments in stochastic variational inference to develop a `black-box' approximate inference technique for latent variable models with latent dynamical structure. We propose a structured Gaussian variational approximate posterior that carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman filter-smoother but, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach to approximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent variable generative models. We show that our approach recovers accurate estimates in the case of basic models with closed-form posteriors, and more interestingly performs well in comparison to variational approaches that were designed in a bespoke fashion for specific non-conjugate models.	Black box variational inference for state space models
0903.2003v4	We revisit the problem of feature selection in linear discriminant analysis (LDA), that is, when features are correlated. First, we introduce a pooled centroids formulation of the multiclass LDA predictor function, in which the relative weights of Mahalanobis-transformed predictors are given by correlation-adjusted $t$-scores (cat scores). Second, for feature selection we propose thresholding cat scores by controlling false nondiscovery rates (FNDR). Third, training of the classifier is based on James--Stein shrinkage estimates of correlations and variances, where regularization parameters are chosen analytically without resampling. Overall, this results in an effective and computationally inexpensive framework for high-dimensional prediction with natural feature selection. The proposed shrinkage discriminant procedures are implemented in the R package ``sda'' available from the R repository CRAN.

1102.2075v1	We study the scenario of graph-based clustering algorithms such as spectral clustering. Given a set of data points, one first has to construct a graph on the data points and then apply a graph clustering algorithm to find a suitable partition of the graph. Our main question is if and how the construction of the graph (choice of the graph, choice of parameters, choice of weights) influences the outcome of the final clustering result. To this end we study the convergence of cluster quality measures such as the normalized cut or the Cheeger cut on various kinds of random geometric graphs as the sample size tends to infinity. It turns out that the limit values of the same objective function are systematically different on different types of graphs. This implies that clustering results systematically depend on the graph and can be very different for different types of graph. We provide examples to illustrate the implications on spectral clustering.	How the result of graph clustering methods depends on the construction  of the graph
1301.0858v1	"A new geometrically-motivated algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization is developed and applied to the discovery of latent ""topics"" for text and image ""document"" corpora.

In contrast to related approaches that are based on solving non-convex optimization problems using suboptimal approximations, locally-optimal methods, or heuristics, the new algorithm is convex, has polynomial complexity, and has competitive qualitative and quantitative performance compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches on synthetic and real-world datasets."

1110.3204v1	We introduce a factor analysis model that summarizes the dependencies between observed variable groups, instead of dependencies between individual variables as standard factor analysis does. A group may correspond to one view of the same set of objects, one of many data sets tied by co-occurrence, or a set of alternative variables collected from statistics tables to measure one property of interest. We show that by assuming group-wise sparse factors, active in a subset of the sets, the variation can be decomposed into factors explaining relationships between the sets and factors explaining away set-specific variation. We formulate the assumptions in a Bayesian model which provides the factors, and apply the model to two data analysis tasks, in neuroimaging and chemical systems biology.

1108.0453v1	In many data mining applications collection of sufficiently large datasets is the most time consuming and expensive. On the other hand, industrial methods of data collection create huge databases, and make difficult direct applications of the advanced machine learning algorithms. To address the above problems, we consider active learning (AL), which may be very efficient either for the experimental design or for the data filtering. In this paper we demonstrate using the online evaluation opportunity provided by the AL Challenge that quite competitive results may be produced using a small percentage of the available data. Also, we present several alternative criteria, which may be useful for the evaluation of the active learning processes. The author of this paper attended special presentation in Barcelona, where results of the WCCI 2010 AL Challenge were discussed.	On the Evaluation Criterions for the Active Learning Processes
1712.08104v2	"We investigate the optimization of two probabilistic generative models with binary latent variables using a novel variational EM approach. The approach distinguishes itself from previous variational approaches by using latent states as variational parameters. Here we use efficient and general purpose sampling procedures to vary the latent states, and investigate the ""black box"" applicability of the resulting optimization procedure. For general purpose applicability, samples are drawn from approximate marginal distributions of the considered generative model as well as from the model's prior distribution. As such, variational sampling is defined in a generic form, and is directly executable for a given model. As a proof of concept, we then apply the novel procedure (A) to Binary Sparse Coding (a model with continuous observables), and (B) to basic Sigmoid Belief Networks (which are models with binary observables). Numerical experiments verify that the investigated approach efficiently as well as effectively increases a variational free energy objective without requiring any additional analytical steps."

1201.1450v1	"An empirical investigation of the interaction of sample size and discretization - in this case the entropy-based method CAIM (Class-Attribute Interdependence Maximization) - was undertaken to evaluate the impact and potential bias introduced into data mining performance metrics due to variation in sample size as it impacts the discretization process. Of particular interest was the effect of discretizing within cross-validation folds averse to outside discretization folds. Previous publications have suggested that discretizing externally can bias performance results; however, a thorough review of the literature found no empirical evidence to support such an assertion. This investigation involved construction of over 117,000 models on seven distinct datasets from the UCI (University of California-Irvine) Machine Learning Library and multiple modeling methods across a variety of configurations of sample size and discretization, with each unique ""setup"" being independently replicated ten times. The analysis revealed a significant optimistic bias as sample sizes decreased and discretization was employed. The study also revealed that there may be a relationship between the interaction that produces such bias and the numbers and types of predictor attributes, extending the ""curse of dimensionality"" concept from feature selection into the discretization realm. Directions for further exploration are laid out, as well some general guidelines about the proper application of discretization in light of these results."

1606.08882v1	"Contagions such as the spread of popular news stories, or infectious diseases, propagate in cascades over dynamic networks with unobservable topologies. However, ""social signals"" such as product purchase time, or blog entry timestamps are measurable, and implicitly depend on the underlying topology, making it possible to track it over time. Interestingly, network topologies often ""jump"" between discrete states that may account for sudden changes in the observed signals. The present paper advocates a switched dynamic structural equation model to capture the topology-dependent cascade evolution, as well as the discrete states driving the underlying topologies. Conditions under which the proposed switched model is identifiable are established. Leveraging the edge sparsity inherent to social networks, a recursive $\ell_1$-norm regularized least-squares estimator is put forth to jointly track the states and network topologies. An efficient first-order proximal-gradient algorithm is developed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Numerical experiments on both synthetic data and real cascades measured over the span of one year are conducted, and test results corroborate the efficacy of the advocated approach."

1507.05016v2	We introduce incremental variational inference and apply it to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Incremental variational inference is inspired by incremental EM and provides an alternative to stochastic variational inference. Incremental LDA can process massive document collections, does not require to set a learning rate, converges faster to a local optimum of the variational bound and enjoys the attractive property of monotonically increasing it. We study the performance of incremental LDA on large benchmark data sets. We further introduce a stochastic approximation of incremental variational inference which extends to the asynchronous distributed setting. The resulting distributed algorithm achieves comparable performance as single host incremental variational inference, but with a significant speed-up.

1103.0897v3	We present a probabilistic viewpoint to multiple kernel learning unifying well-known regularised risk approaches and recent advances in approximate Bayesian inference relaxations. The framework proposes a general objective function suitable for regression, robust regression and classification that is lower bound of the marginal likelihood and contains many regularised risk approaches as special cases. Furthermore, we derive an efficient and provably convergent optimisation algorithm.	Multiple Kernel Learning: A Unifying Probabilistic Viewpoint
1606.00813v1	We present a novel k-way high-dimensional graphical model called the Generalized Root Model (GRM) that explicitly models dependencies between variable sets of size k > 2---where k = 2 is the standard pairwise graphical model. This model is based on taking the k-th root of the original sufficient statistics of any univariate exponential family with positive sufficient statistics, including the Poisson and exponential distributions. As in the recent work with square root graphical (SQR) models [Inouye et al. 2016]---which was restricted to pairwise dependencies---we give the conditions of the parameters that are needed for normalization using the radial conditionals similar to the pairwise case [Inouye et al. 2016]. In particular, we show that the Poisson GRM has no restrictions on the parameters and the exponential GRM only has a restriction akin to negative definiteness. We develop a simple but general learning algorithm based on L1-regularized node-wise regressions. We also present a general way of numerically approximating the log partition function and associated derivatives of the GRM univariate node conditionals---in contrast to [Inouye et al. 2016], which only provided algorithm for estimating the exponential SQR. To illustrate GRM, we model word counts with a Poisson GRM and show the associated k-sized variable sets. We finish by discussing methods for reducing the parameter space in various situations.

1605.05918v2	Sparse versions of principal component analysis (PCA) have imposed themselves as simple, yet powerful ways of selecting relevant features of high-dimensional data in an unsupervised manner. However, when several sparse principal components are computed, the interpretation of the selected variables is difficult since each axis has its own sparsity pattern and has to be interpreted separately. To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure called globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA) that allows to obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. This allows the practitioner to identify the original variables which are relevant to describe the data. To this end, using Roweis' probabilistic interpretation of PCA and a Gaussian prior on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact computation of the marginal likelihood of a Bayesian PCA model. To avoid the drawbacks of discrete model selection, a simple relaxation of this framework is presented. It allows to find a path of models using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood is then maximized over this path. This approach is illustrated on real and synthetic data sets. In particular, using unlabeled microarray data, GSPPCA infers much more relevant gene subsets than traditional sparse PCA algorithms.	Bayesian Variable Selection for Globally Sparse Probabilistic PCA
0806.2669v1	We present the Procrustes measure, a novel measure based on Procrustes rotation that enables quantitative comparison of the output of manifold-based embedding algorithms (such as LLE (Roweis and Saul, 2000) and Isomap (Tenenbaum et al, 2000)). The measure also serves as a natural tool when choosing dimension-reduction parameters. We also present two novel dimension-reduction techniques that attempt to minimize the suggested measure, and compare the results of these techniques to the results of existing algorithms. Finally, we suggest a simple iterative method that can be used to improve the output of existing algorithms.

1704.02534v1	In this paper we study the problem of noisy tensor completion for tensors that admit a canonical polyadic or CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition with one of the factors being sparse. We present general theoretical error bounds for an estimate obtained by using a complexity-regularized maximum likelihood principle and then instantiate these bounds for the case of additive white Gaussian noise. We also provide an ADMM-type algorithm for solving the complexity-regularized maximum likelihood problem and validate the theoretical finding via experiments on synthetic data set.

1105.4871v1	"We address the online linear optimization problem when the actions of the forecaster are represented by binary vectors. Our goal is to understand the magnitude of the minimax regret for the worst possible set of actions. We study the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial information models of the so-called ""semi-bandit"", and ""bandit"" problems. We consider both $L_\infty$-, and $L_2$-type of restrictions for the losses assigned by the adversary. We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied in the series of papers Gyorgy et al. (2007), Dani et al. (2008), Abernethy et al. (2008), Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2009), Helmbold and Warmuth (2009), Koolen et al. (2010), Uchiya et al. (2010), Kale et al. (2010) and Audibert and Bubeck (2010). We provide simple proofs that recover most of the previous results. We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the bandit game, the upper and lower bounds are tight, up to a constant factor. Finally, we answer a question asked by Koolen et al. (2010) by showing that the exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against $L_{\infty}$ adversaries."	Minimax Policies for Combinatorial Prediction Games
1404.5028v1	Mean shift clustering finds the modes of the data probability density by identifying the zero points of the density gradient. Since it does not require to fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular clustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of the mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation and then compute its gradient. However, since good density estimation does not necessarily imply accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect two-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to directly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density estimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus is computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point algorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean shift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance. We empirically show that the proposed clustering method works much better than the mean shift especially for high-dimensional data. Experimental results further indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing clustering methods.	Clustering via Mode Seeking by Direct Estimation of the Gradient of a  Log-Density
1507.05333v3	Methods of transfer learning try to combine knowledge from several related tasks (or domains) to improve performance on a test task. Inspired by causal methodology, we relax the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant over all tasks. We show how this assumption can be motivated from ideas in the field of causality. We prove that in an adversarial setting using this subset for prediction is optimal if no examples from the test task are observed; we further provide examples, in which the tasks are sufficiently diverse and the estimator therefore outperforms pooling the data, even on average. If examples from the test task are available, we provide a method to transfer knowledge from the training tasks and exploit all available features for prediction. We introduce a practical method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset and provide corresponding code. We present results on synthetic data sets and a gene deletion data set.

1710.11260v1	This paper raises an implicit manifold learning perspective in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by studying how the support of the learned distribution, modelled as a submanifold $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$, perfectly match with $\mathcal{M}_{r}$, the support of the real data distribution. We show that optimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence forces $\mathcal{M}_{\theta}$ to perfectly match with $\mathcal{M}_{r}$, while optimizing Wasserstein distance does not. On the other hand, by comparing the gradients of the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Wasserstein distances ($W_1$ and $W_2^2$) in their primal forms, we conjecture that Wasserstein $W_2^2$ may enjoy desirable properties such as reduced mode collapse. It is therefore interesting to design new distances that inherit the best from both distances.	Implicit Manifold Learning on Generative Adversarial Networks
1602.03253v2	We derive a new discrepancy statistic for measuring differences between two probability distributions based on combining Stein's identity with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. We apply our result to test how well a probabilistic model fits a set of observations, and derive a new class of powerful goodness-of-fit tests that are widely applicable for complex and high dimensional distributions, even for those with computationally intractable normalization constants. Both theoretical and empirical properties of our methods are studied thoroughly.	A Kernelized Stein Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests and Model  Evaluation
1003.4944v1	Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a powerful method for modeling data associated with pairwise relationships, finding use in collaborative filtering, computational biology, and document analysis, among other areas. In many domains, there is additional information that can assist in prediction. For example, when modeling movie ratings, we might know when the rating occurred, where the user lives, or what actors appear in the movie. It is difficult, however, to incorporate this side information into the PMF model. We propose a framework for incorporating side information by coupling together multiple PMF problems via Gaussian process priors. We replace scalar latent features with functions that vary over the space of side information. The GP priors on these functions require them to vary smoothly and share information. We successfully use this new method to predict the scores of professional basketball games, where side information about the venue and date of the game are relevant for the outcome.

1001.4019v1	"Inspired by a growing interest in analyzing network data, we study the problem of node classification on graphs, focusing on approaches based on kernel machines. Conventionally, kernel machines are linear classifiers in the implicit feature space. We argue that linear classification in the feature space of kernels commonly used for graphs is often not enough to produce good results. When this is the case, one naturally considers nonlinear classifiers in the feature space. We show that repeating this process produces something we call ""deep kernel machines."" We provide some examples where deep kernel machines can make a big difference in classification performance, and point out some connections to various recent literature on deep architectures in artificial intelligence and machine learning."

1201.3973v2	In this paper, we discuss an extension of the Split Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Split HMC) method for Gaussian process model (GPM). This method is based on splitting the Hamiltonian in a way that allows much of the movement around the state space to be done at low computational cost. To this end, we approximate the negative log density (i.e., the energy function) of the distribution of interest by a quadratic function U0 for which Hamiltonian dynamics can be solved analytically. The overall energy function U is then written as U0 + U1, where U1 is the approximation error. The Hamiltonian is then split into two parts; one part is based on U0 is handled analytically, the other part is based on U1 for which we approximate Hamiltonian's equations by discretizing time. We use simulated and real data to compare the performance of our method to the standard HMC. We find that splitting the Hamiltonian for GP models could lead to substantial improvement (up to 10 folds) of sampling efficiency, which is measured in terms of the amount of time required for producing an independent sample with high acceptance probability from posterior distributions.

0809.4866v1	This report concerns the problem of dimensionality reduction through information geometric methods on statistical manifolds. While there has been considerable work recently presented regarding dimensionality reduction for the purposes of learning tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization, these methods have focused primarily on Riemannian manifolds in Euclidean space. While sufficient for many applications, there are many high-dimensional signals which have no straightforward and meaningful Euclidean representation. In these cases, signals may be more appropriately represented as a realization of some distribution lying on a statistical manifold, or a manifold of probability density functions (PDFs). We present a framework for dimensionality reduction that uses information geometry for both statistical manifold reconstruction as well as dimensionality reduction in the data domain.

1106.2697v2	A key problem in statistical modeling is model selection, how to choose a model at an appropriate level of complexity. This problem appears in many settings, most prominently in choosing the number ofclusters in mixture models or the number of factors in factor analysis. In this tutorial we describe Bayesian nonparametric methods, a class of methods that side-steps this issue by allowing the data to determine the complexity of the model. This tutorial is a high-level introduction to Bayesian nonparametric methods and contains several examples of their application.	A Tutorial on Bayesian Nonparametric Models
0901.2730v1	In this paper, we present a novel and general framework called {\it Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Networks} (MaxEnDNet), which integrates the max-margin structured learning and Bayesian-style estimation and combines and extends their merits. Major innovations of this model include: 1) It generalizes the extant Markov network prediction rule based on a point estimator of weights to a Bayesian-style estimator that integrates over a learned distribution of the weights. 2) It extends the conventional max-entropy discrimination learning of classification rule to a new structural max-entropy discrimination paradigm of learning the distribution of Markov networks. 3) It subsumes the well-known and powerful Maximum Margin Markov network (M$^3$N) as a special case, and leads to a model similar to an $L_1$-regularized M$^3$N that is simultaneously primal and dual sparse, or other types of Markov network by plugging in different prior distributions of the weights. 4) It offers a simple inference algorithm that combines existing variational inference and convex-optimization based M$^3$N solvers as subroutines. 5) It offers a PAC-Bayesian style generalization bound. This work represents the first successful attempt to combine Bayesian-style learning (based on generative models) with structured maximum margin learning (based on a discriminative model), and outperforms a wide array of competing methods for structured input/output learning on both synthetic and real data sets.

1603.07871v2	We consider the problem of change-point detection in multivariate time-series. The multivariate distribution of the observations is supposed to follow a graphical model, whose graph and parameters are affected by abrupt changes throughout time. We demonstrate that it is possible to perform exact Bayesian inference whenever one considers a simple class of undirected graphs called spanning trees as possible structures. We are then able to integrate on the graph and segmentation spaces at the same time by combining classical dynamic programming with algebraic results pertaining to spanning trees. In particular, we show that quantities such as posterior distributions for change-points or posterior edge probabilities over time can efficiently be obtained. We illustrate our results on both synthetic and experimental data arising from biology and neuroscience.

1110.5508v1	We propose a scalable, efficient and statistically motivated computational framework for Graphical Lasso (Friedman et al., 2007b) - a covariance regularization framework that has received significant attention in the statistics community over the past few years. Existing algorithms have trouble in scaling to dimensions larger than a thousand. Our proposal significantly enhances the state-of-the-art for such moderate sized problems and gracefully scales to larger problems where other algorithms become practically infeasible. This requires a few key new ideas. We operate on the primal problem and use a subtle variation of block-coordinate-methods which drastically reduces the computational complexity by orders of magnitude. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the convergence and complexity of our algorithm and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal via experiments. We believe that our framework extends the applicability of Graphical Lasso to large-scale modern applications like bioinformatics, collaborative filtering and social networks, among others.

1103.5202v2	In this paper, we give a new sharp generalization bound of lp-MKL which is a generalized framework of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and imposes lp-mixed-norm regularization instead of l1-mixed-norm regularization. We utilize localization techniques to obtain the sharp learning rate. The bound is characterized by the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the associated kernels. A larger decay rate gives a faster convergence rate. Furthermore, we give the minimax learning rate on the ball characterized by lp-mixed-norm in the product space. Then we show that our derived learning rate of lp-MKL achieves the minimax optimal rate on the lp-mixed-norm ball.	Fast Learning Rate of lp-MKL and its Minimax Optimality
1010.4945v1	A density ratio is defined by the ratio of two probability densities. We study the inference problem of density ratios and apply a semi-parametric density-ratio estimator to the two-sample homogeneity test. In the proposed test procedure, the f-divergence between two probability densities is estimated using a density-ratio estimator. The f-divergence estimator is then exploited for the two-sample homogeneity test. We derive the optimal estimator of f-divergence in the sense of the asymptotic variance, and then investigate the relation between the proposed test procedure and the existing score test based on empirical likelihood estimator. Through numerical studies, we illustrate the adequacy of the asymptotic theory for finite-sample inference.	f-divergence estimation and two-sample homogeneity test under  semiparametric density-ratio models
1203.3461v1	Most existing distance metric learning methods assume perfect side information that is usually given in pairwise or triplet constraints. Instead, in many real-world applications, the constraints are derived from side information, such as users' implicit feedbacks and citations among articles. As a result, these constraints are usually noisy and contain many mistakes. In this work, we aim to learn a distance metric from noisy constraints by robust optimization in a worst-case scenario, to which we refer as robust metric learning. We formulate the learning task initially as a combinatorial optimization problem, and show that it can be elegantly transformed to a convex programming problem. We present an efficient learning algorithm based on smooth optimization [7]. It has a worst-case convergence rate of O(1/{\surd}{\varepsilon}) for smooth optimization problems, where {\varepsilon} is the desired error of the approximate solution. Finally, our empirical study with UCI data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.	Robust Metric Learning by Smooth Optimization
1204.6509v1	We introduce in this paper a new way of optimizing the natural extension of the quantization error using in k-means clustering to dissimilarity data.

1702.06209v1	Hypothesis tests in models whose dimension far exceeds the sample size can be formulated much like the classical studentized tests only after the initial bias of estimation is removed successfully. The theory of debiased estimators can be developed in the context of quantile regression models for a fixed quantile value. However, it is frequently desirable to formulate tests based on the quantile regression process, as this leads to more robust tests and more stable confidence sets. Additionally, inference in quantile regression requires estimation of the so called sparsity function, which depends on the unknown density of the error. In this paper we consider a debiasing approach for the uniform testing problem. We develop high-dimensional regression rank scores and show how to use them to estimate the sparsity function, as well as how to adapt them for inference involving the quantile regression process. Furthermore, we develop a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in a location-shift high-dimensional models and confidence sets that are uniformly valid for many quantile values. The main technical result are the development of a Bahadur representation of the debiasing estimator that is uniform over a range of quantiles and uniform convergence of the quantile process to the Brownian bridge process, which are of independent interest. Simulation studies illustrate finite sample properties of our procedure.	Uniform Inference for High-dimensional Quantile Regression: Linear  Functionals and Regression Rank Scores
1502.02089v1	Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) are probability distributions over vector-valued functions, and have been previously used for multi-output regression and for multi-class classification. A less explored facet of the multi-output Gaussian process is that it can be used as a generative model for vector-valued random fields in the context of pattern recognition. As a generative model, the multi-output GP is able to handle vector-valued functions with continuous inputs, as opposed, for example, to hidden Markov models. It also offers the ability to model multivariate random functions with high dimensional inputs. In this report, we use a discriminative training criteria known as Minimum Classification Error to fit the parameters of a multi-output Gaussian process. We compare the performance of generative training and discriminative training of MOGP in emotion recognition, activity recognition, and face recognition. We also compare the proposed methodology against hidden Markov models trained in a generative and in a discriminative way.	Discriminative training for Convolved Multiple-Output Gaussian processes
1510.06463v1	Inventory control with unknown demand distribution is considered, with emphasis placed on the case involving discrete nonperishable items. We focus on an adaptive policy which in every period uses, as much as possible, the optimal newsvendor ordering quantity for the empirical distribution learned up to that period. The policy is assessed using the regret criterion, which measures the price paid for ambiguity on demand distribution over $T$ periods. When there are guarantees on the latter's separation from the critical newsvendor parameter $\beta=b/(h+b)$, a constant upper bound on regret can be found. Without any prior information on the demand distribution, we show that the regret does not grow faster than the rate $T^{1/2+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$. In view of a known lower bound, this is almost the best one could hope for. Simulation studies involving this along with other policies are also conducted.

1701.04342v1	"Regression models are increasingly built using datasets which do not follow a design of experiment. Instead, the data is e.g. gathered by an automated monitoring of a technical system. As a consequence, already the input data represents phenomena of the system and violates statistical assumptions of distributions. The input data can show correlations, clusters or other patterns. Further, the distribution of input data influences the reliability of regression models. We propose criteria to quantify typical phenomena of input data for regression and show their suitability with simulated benchmark datasets. ----- Regressionen werden zunehmend auf Datens\""atzen angewendet, deren Eingangsvektoren nicht durch eine statistische Versuchsplanung festgelegt wurden.

1801.08310v1	Decision trees algorithms use a gain function to select the best split during the tree's induction. This function is crucial to obtain trees with high predictive accuracy. Some gain functions can suffer from a bias when it compares splits of different arities. Quinlan proposed a gain ratio in C4.5's information gain function to fix this bias. In this paper, we present an updated version of the gain ratio that performs better as it tries to fix the gain ratio's bias for unbalanced trees and some splits with low predictive interest.

1610.06949v1	"Gradient matching with Gaussian processes is a promising tool for learning parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODE's). The essence of gradient matching is to model the prior over state variables as a Gaussian process which implies that the joint distribution given the ODE's and GP kernels is also Gaussian distributed. The state-derivatives are integrated out analytically since they are modelled as latent variables. However, the state variables themselves are also latent variables because they are contaminated by noise. Previous work sampled the state variables since integrating them out is \textit{not} analytically tractable. In this paper we use mean-field approximation to establish tight variational lower bounds that decouple state variables and are therefore, in contrast to the integral over state variables, analytically tractable and even concave for a restricted family of ODE's, including nonlinear and periodic ODE's. Such variational lower bounds facilitate ""hill climbing"" to determine the maximum a posteriori estimate of ODE parameters. An additional advantage of our approach over sampling methods is the determination of a proxy to the intractable posterior distribution over state variables given observations and the ODE's."

1802.06226v1	Measuring divergence between two distributions is essential in machine learning and statistics and has various applications including binary classification, change point detection, and two-sample test. Furthermore, in the era of big data, designing divergence measure that is interpretable and can handle high-dimensional and complex data becomes extremely important. In the paper, we propose a post selection inference (PSI) framework for divergence measure, which can select a set of statistically significant features that discriminate two distributions. Specifically, we employ an additive variant of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for features and introduce a general hypothesis test for PSI. A novel MMD estimator using the incomplete U-statistics, which has an asymptotically Normal distribution (under mild assumptions) and gives high detection power in PSI, is also proposed and analyzed theoretically. Through synthetic and real-world feature selection experiments, we show that the proposed framework can successfully detect statistically significant features. Last, we propose a sample selection framework for analyzing different members in the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) family.

1610.06194v2	"Effective and accurate model selection is an important problem in modern data analysis. One of the major challenges is the computational burden required to handle large data sets that cannot be stored or processed on one machine. Another challenge one may encounter is the presence of outliers and contaminations that damage the inference quality. In this paper, we extend the recently studied ""divide and conquer"" strategy in Bayesian parametric inference to the model selection context, in which we divide the observations of the full data set into roughly equal subsets and perform inference and model selection independently on each subset. After local subset inference, we aggregate the posterior model probabilities or other model/variable selection criteria to obtain a final model, by using the notion of geometric median. We show how this approach leads to improved concentration in finding the ""correct"" model and also parameters, and how it is robust to outliers and data contamination."

1606.05492v3	This paper discusses about an R package that implements the Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been successfully applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction. The clustering part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its implementation with minimum efforts. This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also provides a simple example of usage. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository.

In particular we develop a flexible methodological framework where the modeled functions and derivatives of a given order are subject to inequality or equality constraints. We characterize the posterior distribution over model and constraint parameters through stochastic variational inference techniques. As a result, the proposed approach allows for accurate and scalable uncertainty quantification of predictions and parameters. We demonstrate the application of equality constraints in the challenging problem of parameter inference in ordinary differential equation models, while we showcase the application of inequality constraints on monotonic regression on count data. The proposed approach is extensively tested in several experimental settings, leading to highly competitive results in challenging modeling applications, while offering high expressiveness, flexibility and scalability."	Constraining the Dynamics of Deep Probabilistic Models
1212.1263v1	In this paper we prove the probabilistic continuous complexity conjecture. In continuous complexity theory, this states that the complexity of solving a continuous problem with probability approaching 1 converges (in this limit) to the complexity of solving the same problem in its worst case. We prove the conjecture holds if and only if space of problem elements is uniformly convex. The non-uniformly convex case has a striking counterexample in the problem of identifying a Brownian path in Wiener space, where it is shown that probabilistic complexity converges to only half of the worst case complexity in this limit.

1203.0038v1	In this letter we borrow from the inference techniques developed for unbounded state-cardinality (nonparametric) variants of the HMM and use them to develop a tuning-parameter free, black-box inference procedure for Explicit-state-duration hidden Markov models (EDHMM). EDHMMs are HMMs that have latent states consisting of both discrete state-indicator and discrete state-duration random variables. In contrast to the implicit geometric state duration distribution possessed by the standard HMM, EDHMMs allow the direct parameterisation and estimation of per-state duration distributions. As most duration distributions are defined over the positive integers, truncation or other approximations are usually required to perform EDHMM inference.

1711.07527v1	Inpatient care is a large share of total health care spending, making analysis of inpatient utilization patterns an important part of understanding what drives health care spending growth. Common features of inpatient utilization measures include zero inflation, over-dispersion, and skewness, all of which complicate statistical modeling. Mixture modeling is a popular approach that can accommodate these features of health care utilization data. In this work, we add a nonparametric clustering component to such models. Our fully Bayesian model framework allows for an unknown number of mixing components, so that the data determine the number of mixture components. When we apply the modeling framework to data on hospital lengths of stay for patients with lung cancer, we find distinct subgroups of patients with differences in means and variances of hospital days, health and treatment covariates, and relationships between covariates and length of stay.

1404.5443v1	This paper presents a novel approach for approximate integration over the uncertainty of noise and signal variances in Gaussian process (GP) regression. Our efficient and straightforward approach can also be applied to integration over input dependent noise variance (heteroscedasticity) and input dependent signal variance (nonstationarity) by setting independent GP priors for the noise and signal variances. We use expectation propagation (EP) for inference and compare results to Markov chain Monte Carlo in two simulated data sets and three empirical examples. The results show that EP produces comparable results with less computational burden.	Approximate Inference for Nonstationary Heteroscedastic Gaussian process  Regression

1606.04366v2	In this paper we develop a method for learning nonlinear systems with multiple outputs and inputs. We begin by modelling the errors of a nominal predictor of the system using a latent variable framework. Then using the maximum likelihood principle we derive a criterion for learning the model. The resulting optimization problem is tackled using a majorization-minimization approach. Finally, we develop a convex majorization technique and show that it enables a recursive identification method. The method learns parsimonious predictive models and is tested on both synthetic and real nonlinear systems.	Recursive nonlinear-system identification using latent variables
1707.08712v1	Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and orthogonal least squares (OLS) are widely used for sparse signal reconstruction in under-determined linear regression problems. The performance of these compressed sensing (CS) algorithms depends crucially on the \textit{a priori} knowledge of either the sparsity of the signal ($k_0$) or noise variance ($\sigma^2$). Both $k_0$ and $\sigma^2$ are unknown in general and extremely difficult to estimate in under determined models. This limits the application of OMP and OLS in many practical situations. In this article, we develop two computationally efficient frameworks namely TF-IGP and RRT-IGP for using OMP and OLS even when $k_0$ and $\sigma^2$ are unavailable. Both TF-IGP and RRT-IGP are analytically shown to accomplish successful sparse recovery under the same set of restricted isometry conditions on the design matrix required for OMP/OLS with \textit{a priori} knowledge of $k_0$ and $\sigma^2$. Numerical simulations also indicate a highly competitive performance of TF-IGP and RRT-IGP in comparison to OMP/OLS with \textit{a priori} knowledge of $k_0$ and $\sigma^2$.

0904.0584v1	We propose an efficient algorithm for sparse signal reconstruction problems. The proposed algorithm is an augmented Lagrangian method based on the dual sparse reconstruction problem. It is efficient when the number of unknown variables is much larger than the number of observations because of the dual formulation. Moreover, the primal variable is explicitly updated and the sparsity in the solution is exploited. Numerical comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm is favorable when the design matrix is poorly conditioned or dense and very large.

1609.01051v2	This work presents PESMOC, Predictive Entropy Search for Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization with Constraints, an information-based strategy for the simultaneous optimization of multiple expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions under the presence of several constraints. PESMOC can hence be used to solve a wide range of optimization problems. Iteratively, PESMOC chooses an input location on which to evaluate the objective functions and the constraints so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the Pareto set of the corresponding optimization problem. The constraints considered in PESMOC are assumed to have similar properties to those of the objective functions in typical Bayesian optimization problems. That is, they do not have a known expression (which prevents gradient computation), their evaluation is considered to be very expensive, and the resulting observations may be corrupted by noise. These constraints arise in a plethora of expensive black-box optimization problems. We carry out synthetic experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of PESMOC, where we sample both the objectives and the constraints from a Gaussian process prior. The results obtained show that PESMOC is able to provide better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations than a strategy based on random search.

1710.05213v1	This paper considers the problem of brain disease classification based on connectome data. A connectome is a network representation of a human brain. The typical connectome classification problem is very challenging because of the small sample size and high dimensionality of the data. We propose to use simultaneous approximate diagonalization of adjacency matrices in order to compute their eigenstructures in more stable way. The obtained approximate eigenvalues are further used as features for classification. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be efficient for detection of Alzheimer's disease, outperforming simple baselines and competing with state-of-the-art approaches to brain disease classification.	Simultaneous Matrix Diagonalization for Structural Brain Networks  Classification
1011.4088v1	Often we wish to predict a large number of variables that depend on each other as well as on other observed variables. Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classification and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random fields, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields.	An Introduction to Conditional Random Fields
1412.6515v4	Two recently introduced criteria for estimation of generative models are both based on a reduction to binary classification. Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is an estimation procedure in which a generative model is trained to be able to distinguish data samples from noise samples. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are pairs of generator and discriminator networks, with the generator network learning to generate samples by attempting to fool the discriminator network into believing its samples are real data. Both estimation procedures use the same function to drive learning, which naturally raises questions about how they are related to each other, as well as whether this function is related to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). NCE corresponds to training an internal data model belonging to the {\em discriminator} network but using a fixed generator network. We show that a variant of NCE, with a dynamic generator network, is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation. Since pairing a learned discriminator with an appropriate dynamically selected generator recovers MLE, one might expect the reverse to hold for pairing a learned generator with a certain discriminator. However, we show that recovering MLE for a learned generator requires departing from the distinguishability game. Specifically: (i) The expected gradient of the NCE discriminator can be made to match the expected gradient of MLE, if one is allowed to use a non-stationary noise distribution for NCE, (ii) No choice of discriminator network can make the expected gradient for the GAN generator match that of MLE, and (iii) The existing theory does not guarantee that GANs will converge in the non-convex case. This suggests that the key next step in GAN research is to determine whether GANs converge, and if not, to modify their training algorithm to force convergence.	On distinguishability criteria for estimating generative models
1605.07332v2	In many applications, it is desirable to extract only the relevant aspects of data. A principled way to do this is the information bottleneck (IB) method, where one seeks a code that maximizes information about a 'relevance' variable, Y, while constraining the information encoded about the original data, X. Unfortunately however, the IB method is computationally demanding when data are high-dimensional and/or non-gaussian. Here we propose an approximate variational scheme for maximizing a lower bound on the IB objective, analogous to variational EM. Using this method, we derive an IB algorithm to recover features that are both relevant and sparse. Finally, we demonstrate how kernelized versions of the algorithm can be used to address a broad range of problems with non-linear relation between X and Y.	Relevant sparse codes with variational information bottleneck
0712.1219v2	Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) provides dynamical access into the complex functioning of the human brain, detailing the hemodynamic activity of thousands of voxels during hundreds of sequential time points. One approach towards illuminating the connection between fMRI and cognitive function is through decoding; how do the time series of voxel activities combine to provide information about internal and external experience? Here we seek models of fMRI decoding which are balanced between the simplicity of their interpretation and the effectiveness of their prediction. We use signals from a subject immersed in virtual reality to compare global and local methods of prediction applying both linear and nonlinear techniques of dimensionality reduction. We find that the prediction of complex stimuli is remarkably low-dimensional, saturating with less than 100 features. In particular, we build effective models based on the decorrelated components of cognitive activity in the classically-defined Brodmann areas. For some of the stimuli, the top predictive areas were surprisingly transparent, including Wernicke's area for verbal instructions, visual cortex for facial and body features, and visual-temporal regions for velocity. Direct sensory experience resulted in the most robust predictions, with the highest correlation ($c \sim 0.8$) between the predicted and experienced time series of verbal instructions. Techniques based on non-linear dimensionality reduction (Laplacian eigenmaps) performed similarly. The interpretability and relative simplicity of our approach provides a conceptual basis upon which to build more sophisticated techniques for fMRI decoding and offers a window into cognitive function during dynamic, natural experience.

1004.4965v1	Graphs provide an efficient tool for object representation in various computer vision applications. Once graph-based representations are constructed, an important question is how to compare graphs. This problem is often formulated as a graph matching problem where one seeks a mapping between vertices of two graphs which optimally aligns their structure. In the classical formulation of graph matching, only one-to-one correspondences between vertices are considered. However, in many applications, graphs cannot be matched perfectly and it is more interesting to consider many-to-many correspondences where clusters of vertices in one graph are matched to clusters of vertices in the other graph. In this paper, we formulate the many-to-many graph matching problem as a discrete optimization problem and propose an approximate algorithm based on a continuous relaxation of the combinatorial problem. We compare our method with other existing methods on several benchmark computer vision datasets.	Many-to-Many Graph Matching: a Continuous Relaxation Approach
1506.07930v1	We present a technique for clustering categorical data by generating many dissimilarity matrices and averaging over them. We begin by demonstrating our technique on low dimensional categorical data and comparing it to several other techniques that have been proposed. Then we give conditions under which our method should yield good results in general. Our method extends to high dimensional categorical data of equal lengths by ensembling over many choices of explanatory variables. In this context we compare our method with two other methods. Finally, we extend our method to high dimensional categorical data vectors of unequal length by using alignment techniques to equalize the lengths. We give examples to show that our method continues to provide good results, in particular, better in the context of genome sequences than clusterings suggested by phylogenetic trees.	Clustering categorical data via ensembling dissimilarity matrices
1205.4343v2	We present a new analysis of the problem of learning with drifting distributions in the batch setting using the notion of discrepancy. We prove learning bounds based on the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis set and the discrepancy of distributions both for a drifting PAC scenario and a tracking scenario. Our bounds are always tighter and in some cases substantially improve upon previous ones based on the $L_1$ distance. We also present a generalization of the standard on-line to batch conversion to the drifting scenario in terms of the discrepancy and arbitrary convex combinations of hypotheses. We introduce a new algorithm exploiting these learning guarantees, which we show can be formulated as a simple QP. Finally, we report the results of preliminary experiments demonstrating the benefits of this algorithm.	New Analysis and Algorithm for Learning with Drifting Distributions
1408.0337v1	A large amount of observational data has been accumulated in various fields in recent times, and there is a growing need to estimate the generating processes of these data. A linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) based on the non-Gaussianity of external influences has been proposed to estimate the data-generating processes of variables. However, the results of the estimation can be biased if there are latent classes. In this paper, we first review LiNGAM, its extended model, as well as the estimation procedure for LiNGAM in a Bayesian framework. We then propose a new Bayesian estimation procedure that solves the problem.	A Bayesian estimation approach to analyze non-Gaussian data-generating  processes with latent classes
1005.1593v2	We improve recently published results about resources of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) required to make them Universal Approximators. We show that any distribution p on the set of binary vectors of length n can be arbitrarily well approximated by an RBM with k-1 hidden units, where k is the minimal number of pairs of binary vectors differing in only one entry such that their union contains the support set of p. In important cases this number is half of the cardinality of the support set of p. We construct a DBN with 2^n/2(n-b), b ~ log(n), hidden layers of width n that is capable of approximating any distribution on {0,1}^n arbitrarily well. This confirms a conjecture presented by Le Roux and Bengio 2010.	Refinements of Universal Approximation Results for Deep Belief Networks  and Restricted Boltzmann Machines
0906.2027v2	Given a matrix M of low-rank, we consider the problem of reconstructing it from noisy observations of a small, random subset of its entries. The problem arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative filtering (the `Netflix problem') to structure-from-motion and positioning. We study a low complexity algorithm introduced by Keshavan et al.(2009), based on a combination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call here OptSpace. We prove performance guarantees that are order-optimal in a number of circumstances.	Matrix Completion from Noisy Entries
1511.02722v1	Learning a causal effect from observational data is not straightforward, as this is not possible without further assumptions. If hidden common causes between treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$ cannot be blocked by other measurements, one possibility is to use an instrumental variable. In principle, it is possible under some assumptions to discover whether a variable is structurally instrumental to a target causal effect $X \rightarrow Y$, but current frameworks are somewhat lacking on how general these assumptions can be. A instrumental variable discovery problem is challenging, as no variable can be tested as an instrument in isolation but only in groups, but different variables might require different conditions to be considered an instrument. Moreover, identification constraints might be hard to detect statistically. In this paper, we give a theoretical characterization of instrumental variable discovery, highlighting identifiability problems and solutions, the need for non-Gaussianity assumptions, and how they fit within existing methods.

1107.4976v2	In recent years, a rich variety of shrinkage priors have been proposed that have great promise in addressing massive regression problems. In general, these new priors can be expressed as scale mixtures of normals, but have more complex forms and better properties than traditional Cauchy and double exponential priors. We first propose a new class of normal scale mixtures through a novel generalized beta distribution that encompasses many interesting priors as special cases. This encompassing framework should prove useful in comparing competing priors, considering properties and revealing close connections. We then develop a class of variational Bayes approximations through the new hierarchy presented that will scale more efficiently to the types of truly massive data sets that are now encountered routinely.

1701.00422v2	Personalized treatment of patients based on tissue-specific cancer subtypes has strongly increased the efficacy of the chosen therapies. Even though the amount of data measured for cancer patients has increased over the last years, most cancer subtypes are still diagnosed based on individual data sources (e.g. gene expression data). We propose an unsupervised data integration method based on kernel principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in data analysis. Unfortunately, the straight-forward multiple-kernel extension of this method leads to the use of only one of the input matrices, which does not fit the goal of gaining information from all data sources. Therefore, we present a scoring function to determine the impact of each input matrix. The approach enables visualizing the integrated data and subsequent clustering for cancer subtype identification. Due to the nature of the method, no free parameters have to be set. We apply the methodology to five different cancer data sets and demonstrate its advantages in terms of results and usability.

1802.05035v1	Modeling variability in tensor decomposition methods is one of the challenges of source separation. One possible solution to account for variations from one data set to another, jointly analysed, is to resort to the PARAFAC2 model. However, so far imposing constraints on the mode with variability has not been possible. In the following manuscript, a relaxation of the PARAFAC2 model is introduced, that allows for imposing nonnegativity constraints on the varying mode. An algorithm to compute the proposed flexible PARAFAC2 model is derived, and its performance is studied on both synthetic and chemometrics data.	Nonnegative PARAFAC2: a flexible coupling approach
1406.3070v1	This paper presents foundational theoretical results on distributed parameter estimation for undirected probabilistic graphical models.

0712.2682v2	The problem of biclustering consists of the simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a matrix such that each of the submatrices induced by a pair of row and column clusters is as uniform as possible. In this paper we approximate the optimal biclustering by applying one-way clustering algorithms independently on the rows and on the columns of the input matrix. We show that such a solution yields a worst-case approximation ratio of 1+sqrt(2) under L1-norm for 0-1 valued matrices, and of 2 under L2-norm for real valued matrices.

1112.3699v8	"In this article, we have proposed several approaches for post processing a large ensemble of prediction models or rules. The results from our simulations show that the post processing methods we have considered here are promising. We have used the techniques developed here for estimation of quantitative traits from markers, on the benchmark ""Bostob Housing""data set and in some simulations. In most cases, the produced models had better prediction performance than, for example, the ones produced by the random forest or the rulefit algorithms."	Ensemble Models with Trees and Rules
1411.0254v3	We present the first fully variational Bayesian inference scheme for continuous Gaussian-process-modulated Poisson processes. Such point processes are used in a variety of domains, including neuroscience, geo-statistics and astronomy, but their use is hindered by the computational cost of existing inference schemes. Our scheme: requires no discretisation of the domain; scales linearly in the number of observed events; and is many orders of magnitude faster than previous sampling based approaches. The resulting algorithm is shown to outperform standard methods on synthetic examples, coal mining disaster data and in the prediction of Malaria incidences in Kenya.

1706.02829v4	Time series analysis is used to understand and predict dynamic processes, including evolving demands in business, weather, markets, and biological rhythms. Exponential smoothing is used in all these domains to obtain simple interpretable models of time series and to forecast future values. Despite its popularity, exponential smoothing fails dramatically in the presence of outliers, large amounts of noise, or when the underlying time series changes. We propose a flexible model for time series analysis, using exponential smoothing cells for overlapping time windows. The approach can detect and remove outliers, denoise data, fill in missing observations, and provide meaningful forecasts in challenging situations. In contrast to classic exponential smoothing, which solves a nonconvex optimization problem over the smoothing parameters and initial state, the proposed approach requires solving a single structured convex optimization problem. Recent developments in efficient convex optimization of large-scale dynamic models make the approach tractable. We illustrate new capabilities using synthetic examples, and then use the approach to analyze and forecast noisy real-world time series. Code for the approach and experiments is publicly available.	Time Series Using Exponential Smoothing Cells
1709.01180v1	Stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) has been developed as a flexible family of scalable Bayesian sampling algorithms. However, there has been little theoretical analysis of the impact of minibatch size to the algorithm's convergence rate. In this paper, we prove that under a limited computational budget/time, a larger minibatch size leads to a faster decrease of the mean squared error bound (thus the fastest one corresponds to using full gradients), which motivates the necessity of variance reduction in SG-MCMC. Consequently, by borrowing ideas from stochastic optimization, we propose a practical variance-reduction technique for SG-MCMC, that is efficient in both computation and storage. We develop theory to prove that our algorithm induces a faster convergence rate than standard SG-MCMC. A number of large-scale experiments, ranging from Bayesian learning of logistic regression to deep neural networks, validate the theory and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed variance-reduction SG-MCMC framework.	A Convergence Analysis for A Class of Practical Variance-Reduction  Stochastic Gradient MCMC
1106.3655v2	We generalise the problem of inverse reinforcement learning to multiple tasks, from multiple demonstrations. Each one may represent one expert trying to solve a different task, or as different experts trying to solve the same task. Our main contribution is to formalise the problem as statistical preference elicitation, via a number of structured priors, whose form captures our biases about the relatedness of different tasks or expert policies. In doing so, we introduce a prior on policy optimality, which is more natural to specify. We show that our framework allows us not only to learn to efficiently from multiple experts but to also effectively differentiate between the goals of each. Possible applications include analysing the intrinsic motivations of subjects in behavioural experiments and learning from multiple teachers.	Bayesian multitask inverse reinforcement learning
1410.7365v2	In high-dimensional data, structured noise caused by observed and unobserved factors affecting multiple target variables simultaneously, imposes a serious challenge for modeling, by masking the often weak signal. Therefore, (1) explaining away the structured noise in multiple-output regression is of paramount importance. Additionally, (2) assumptions about the correlation structure of the regression weights are needed. We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the \emph{latent signal-to-noise ratio} which turns out to be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite-dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational unidentifiability in reduced-rank regression models. Simulations and prediction experiments with metabolite, gene expression, FMRI measurement, and macroeconomic time series data show that our model equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance and, in particular, outperforms the standard approach of assuming independent noise and signal models.	Multiple Output Regression with Latent Noise
1702.05243v3	Estimating the state of a dynamical system from a series of noise-corrupted observations is fundamental in many areas of science and engineering. The most well-known method, the Kalman smoother (and the related Kalman filter), relies on assumptions of linearity and Gaussianity that are rarely met in practice. In this paper, we introduced a new dynamical smoothing method that exploits the remarkable capabilities of convolutional neural networks to approximate complex non-linear functions. The main idea is to generate a training set composed of both latent states and observations from an ensemble of simulators and to train the deep network to recover the former from the latter. Importantly, this method only requires the availability of the simulators and can therefore be applied in situations in which either the latent dynamical model or the observation model cannot be easily expressed in closed form. In our simulation studies, we show that the resulting ConvNet smoother has almost optimal performance in the Gaussian case even when the parameters are unknown. Furthermore, the method can be successfully applied to extremely non-linear and non-Gaussian systems. Finally, we empirically validate our approach via the analysis of measured brain signals.	Estimating Nonlinear Dynamics with the ConvNet Smoother
1702.04018v1	Statistical downscaling of global climate models (GCMs) allows researchers to study local climate change effects decades into the future. A wide range of statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in machine learning have not been explored. In this paper, we compare four fundamental statistical methods, Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD), Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine, with three more advanced machine learning methods, Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning (MSSL), BCSD coupled with MSSL, and Convolutional Neural Networks to downscale daily precipitation in the Northeast United States. Metrics to evaluate of each method's ability to capture daily anomalies, large scale climate shifts, and extremes are analyzed. We find that linear methods, led by BCSD, consistently outperform non-linear approaches. The direct application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches.

1210.3335v3	Graph clustering involves the task of dividing nodes into clusters, so that the edge density is higher within clusters as opposed to across clusters. A natural, classic and popular statistical setting for evaluating solutions to this problem is the stochastic block model, also referred to as the planted partition model. In this paper we present a new algorithm--a convexified version of Maximum Likelihood--for graph clustering. We show that, in the classic stochastic block model setting, it outperforms existing methods by polynomial factors when the cluster size is allowed to have general scalings. In fact, it is within logarithmic factors of known lower bounds for spectral methods, and there is evidence suggesting that no polynomial time algorithm would do significantly better. We then show that this guarantee carries over to a more general extension of the stochastic block model. Our method can handle the settings of semi-random graphs, heterogeneous degree distributions, unequal cluster sizes, unaffiliated nodes, partially observed graphs and planted clique/coloring etc. In particular, our results provide the best exact recovery guarantees to date for the planted partition, planted k-disjoint-cliques and planted noisy coloring models with general cluster sizes; in other settings, we match the best existing results up to logarithmic factors.	Improved Graph Clustering
1507.03176v1	Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aims to factorize a matrix into two optimized nonnegative matrices appropriate for the intended applications. The method has been widely used for unsupervised learning tasks, including recommender systems (rating matrix of users by items) and document clustering (weighting matrix of papers by keywords). However, traditional NMF methods typically assume the number of latent factors (i.e., dimensionality of the loading matrices) to be fixed. This assumption makes them inflexible for many applications. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric NMF framework to mitigate this issue by using dependent Indian Buffet Processes (dIBP). In a nutshell, we apply a correlation function for the generation of two stick weights associated with each pair of columns of loading matrices, while still maintaining their respective marginal distribution specified by IBP. As a consequence, the generation of two loading matrices will be column-wise (indirectly) correlated. Under this same framework, two classes of correlation function are proposed (1) using Bivariate beta distribution and (2) using Copula function. Both methods allow us to adopt our work for various applications by flexibly choosing an appropriate parameter settings. Compared with the other state-of-the art approaches in this area, such as using Gaussian Process (GP)-based dIBP, our work is seen to be much more flexible in terms of allowing the two corresponding binary matrix columns to have greater variations in their non-zero entries. Our experiments on the real-world and synthetic datasets show that three proposed models perform well on the document clustering task comparing standard NMF without predefining the dimension for the factor matrices, and the Bivariate beta distribution-based and Copula-based models have better flexibility than the GP-based model.

1101.0316v1	With the present revival of interest in bistatic radar systems, research in that area has gained momentum. Given some of the strategic advantages for a bistatic configuration, and tech- nological advances in the past few years, large-scale implementation of the bistatic systems is a scope for the near future. If the bistatic systems are to replace the monostatic systems (at least par- tially), then all the existing usages of a monostatic system should be manageable in a bistatic system. A detailed investigation of the possibilities of an automatic target recognition (ATR) facil- ity in a bistatic radar system is presented. Because of the lack of data, experiments were carried out on simulated data. Still, the results are positive and make a positive case for the introduction of the bistatic configuration. First, it was found that, contrary to the popular expectation that the bistatic ATR performance might be substantially worse than the monostatic ATR performance, the bistatic ATR performed fairly well (though not better than the monostatic ATR). Second, the ATR per- formance does not deteriorate substantially with increasing bistatic angle. Last, the polarimetric data from bistatic scattering were found to have distinct information, contrary to expert opinions. Along with these results, suggestions were also made about how to stabilise the bistatic-ATR per- formance with changing bistatic angle. Finally, a new fast and robust ATR algorithm (developed in the present work) has been presented.	Bistatic SAR ATR
1004.0524v1	The ECME algorithm has proven to be an effective way of accelerating the EM algorithm for many problems. Recognising the limitation of using prefixed acceleration subspace in ECME, we propose the new Dynamic ECME (DECME) algorithm which allows the acceleration subspace to be chosen dynamically. Our investigation of an inefficient special case of DECME, the classical Successive Overrelaxation (SOR) method, leads to an efficient, simple, and widely applicable DECME implementation, called DECME_v1. The fast convergence of DECME_v1 is established by the theoretical result that, in a small neighbourhood of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), DECME_v1 is equivalent to a conjugate direction method. Numerical results show that DECME_v1 and its two variants are very stable and often converge faster than EM by a factor of one hundred in terms of number of iterations and a factor of thirty in terms of CPU time when EM is very slow.

1305.7255v1	In recent years, manifold learning has become increasingly popular as a tool for performing non-linear dimensionality reduction. This has led to the development of numerous algorithms of varying degrees of complexity that aim to recover man ifold geometry using either local or global features of the data. Building on the Laplacian Eigenmap and Diffusionmaps framework, we propose a new paradigm that offers a guarantee, under reasonable assumptions, that any manifo ld learning algorithm will preserve the geometry of a data set. Our approach is based on augmenting the output of embedding algorithms with geometric informatio n embodied in the Riemannian metric of the manifold. We provide an algorithm for estimating the Riemannian metric from data and demonstrate possible application s of our approach in a variety of examples.

1203.3506v1	We introduce a new family of estimators for unnormalized statistical models. Our family of estimators is parameterized by two nonlinear functions and uses a single sample from an auxiliary distribution, generalizing Maximum Likelihood Monte Carlo estimation of Geyer and Thompson (1992). The family is such that we can estimate the partition function like any other parameter in the model. The estimation is done by optimizing an algebraically simple, well defined objective function, which allows for the use of dedicated optimization methods. We establish consistency of the estimator family and give an expression for the asymptotic covariance matrix, which enables us to further analyze the influence of the nonlinearities and the auxiliary density on estimation performance. Some estimators in our family are particularly stable for a wide range of auxiliary densities. Interestingly, a specific choice of the nonlinearity establishes a connection between density estimation and classification by nonlinear logistic regression. Finally, the optimal amount of auxiliary samples relative to the given amount of the data is considered from the perspective of computational efficiency.

1308.1479v2	Big Data bring new opportunities to modern society and challenges to data scientists. On one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity, and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This article give overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasis on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogeneous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data can not be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions.	Challenges of Big Data Analysis
1711.11394v1	Missing data is an expected issue when large amounts of data is collected, and several imputation techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem. Beneath classical approaches such as MICE, the application of Machine Learning techniques is tempting. Here, the recently proposed missForest imputation method has shown high imputation accuracy under the Missing (Completely) at Random scheme with various missing rates. In its core, it is based on a random forest for classification and regression, respectively. In this paper we study whether this approach can even be enhanced by other methods such as the stochastic gradient tree boosting method, the C5.0 algorithm or modified random forest procedures. In particular, other resampling strategies within the random forest protocol are suggested. In an extensive simulation study, we analyze their performances for continuous, categorical as well as mixed-type data. Therein, MissBooPF, a combination of the stochastic gradient tree boosting method together with the parametrically bootstrapped random forest method, appeared to be promising. Finally, an empirical analysis focusing on credit information and Facebook data is conducted.	Who wins the Miss Contest for Imputation Methods? Our Vote for Miss  BooPF
1311.4669v1	Symmetric binary matrices representing relations among entities are commonly collected in many areas. Our focus is on dynamically evolving binary relational matrices, with interest being in inference on the relationship structure and prediction. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian dynamic model, which reduces dimensionality in characterizing the binary matrix through a lower-dimensional latent space representation, with the latent coordinates evolving in continuous time via Gaussian processes. By using a logistic mapping function from the probability matrix space to the latent relational space, we obtain a flexible and computational tractable formulation. Employing P\`olya-Gamma data augmentation, an efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation, with the dimension of the latent space automatically inferred. We provide some theoretical results on flexibility of the model, and illustrate performance via simulation experiments. We also consider an application to co-movements in world financial markets.

1607.04566v1	Spectral embedding uses eigenfunctions of the discrete Laplacian on a weighted graph to obtain coordinates for an embedding of an abstract data set into Euclidean space. We propose a new pre-processing step of first using the eigenfunctions to simulate a low-frequency wave moving over the data and using both position as well as change in time of the wave to obtain a refined metric to which classical methods of dimensionality reduction can then applied. This is motivated by the behavior of waves, symmetries of the wave equation and the hunting technique of bats. It is shown to be effective in practice and also works for other partial differential equations -- the method yields improved results even for the classical heat equation.

0907.3740v1	We give improved constants for data dependent and variance sensitive confidence bounds, called empirical Bernstein bounds, and extend these inequalities to hold uniformly over classes of functionswhose growth function is polynomial in the sample size n. The bounds lead us to consider sample variance penalization, a novel learning method which takes into account the empirical variance of the loss function. We give conditions under which sample variance penalization is effective. In particular, we present a bound on the excess risk incurred by the method. Using this, we argue that there are situations in which the excess risk of our method is of order 1/n, while the excess risk of empirical risk minimization is of order 1/sqrt/{n}. We show some experimental results, which confirm the theory. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our results to sample compression schemes.	Empirical Bernstein Bounds and Sample Variance Penalization
1003.3570v1	We propose a novel algorithm for greedy forward feature selection for regularized least-squares (RLS) regression and classification, also known as the least-squares support vector machine or ridge regression. The algorithm, which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition. We experimentally demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm and its ability to find good quality feature sets.	Linear Time Feature Selection for Regularized Least-Squares
1202.3776v1	A Support Vector Method for multivariate performance measures was recently introduced by Joachims (2005). The underlying optimization problem is currently solved using cutting plane methods such as SVM-Perf and BMRM. One can show that these algorithms converge to an eta accurate solution in O(1/Lambda*e) iterations, where lambda is the trade-off parameter between the regularizer and the loss function. We present a smoothing strategy for multivariate performance scores, in particular precision/recall break-even point and ROCArea. When combined with Nesterov's accelerated gradient algorithm our smoothing strategy yields an optimization algorithm which converges to an eta accurate solution in O(min{1/e,1/sqrt(lambda*e)}) iterations. Furthermore, the cost per iteration of our scheme is the same as that of SVM-Perf and BMRM. Empirical evaluation on a number of publicly available datasets shows that our method converges significantly faster than cutting plane methods without sacrificing generalization ability.	Smoothing Multivariate Performance Measures
1412.2295v2	We propose a likelihood ratio based inferential framework for high dimensional semiparametric generalized linear models. This framework addresses a variety of challenging problems in high dimensional data analysis, including incomplete data, selection bias, and heterogeneous multitask learning. Our work has three main contributions. (i) We develop a regularized statistical chromatography approach to infer the parameter of interest under the proposed semiparametric generalized linear model without the need of estimating the unknown base measure function. (ii) We propose a new framework to construct post-regularization confidence regions and tests for the low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. Unlike existing post-regularization inferential methods, our approach is based on a novel directional likelihood. In particular, the framework naturally handles generic regularized estimators with nonconvex penalty functions and it can be used to infer least false parameters under misspecified models. (iii) We develop new concentration inequalities and normal approximation results for U-statistics with unbounded kernels, which are of independent interest. We demonstrate the consequences of the general theory by using an example of missing data problem. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis are provided to illustrate our proposed approach.	A Likelihood Ratio Framework for High Dimensional Semiparametric  Regression
1607.02738v2	Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) exploits Hamiltonian dynamics to construct efficient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we present a generalization of HMC which exploits \textit{non-canonical} Hamiltonian dynamics. We refer to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dynamics map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field. We establish a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples where these non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary HMC.	Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
1202.3733v1	We show that the log-likelihood of several probabilistic graphical models is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the lp-norm of the parameters. We discuss several implications of Lipschitz parametrization. We present an upper bound of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that allows understanding methods that penalize the lp-norm of differences of parameters as the minimization of that upper bound. The expected log-likelihood is lower bounded by the negative lp-norm, which allows understanding the generalization ability of probabilistic models. The exponential of the negative lp-norm is involved in the lower bound of the Bayes error rate, which shows that it is reasonable to use parameters as features in algorithms that rely on metric spaces (e.g. classification, dimensionality reduction, clustering). Our results do not rely on specific algorithms for learning the structure or parameters. We show preliminary results for activity recognition and temporal segmentation.	Lipschitz Parametrization of Probabilistic Graphical Models
1612.08915v1	In typical applications of Bayesian optimization, minimal assumptions are made about the objective function being optimized. This is true even when researchers have prior information about the shape of the function with respect to one or more argument. We make the case that shape constraints are often appropriate in at least two important application areas of Bayesian optimization: (1) hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms and (2) decision analysis with utility functions. We describe a methodology for incorporating a variety of shape constraints within the usual Bayesian optimization framework and present positive results from simple applications which suggest that Bayesian optimization with shape constraints is a promising topic for further research.	Bayesian Optimization with Shape Constraints
1201.1657v1	The hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) has become an important Bayesian nonparametric model for grouped data, such as document collections. The HDP is used to construct a flexible mixed-membership model where the number of components is determined by the data. As for most Bayesian nonparametric models, exact posterior inference is intractable---practitioners use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or variational inference. Inspired by the split-merge MCMC algorithm for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model, we describe a novel split-merge MCMC sampling algorithm for posterior inference in the HDP. We study its properties on both synthetic data and text corpora. We find that split-merge MCMC for the HDP can provide significant improvements over traditional Gibbs sampling, and we give some understanding of the data properties that give rise to larger improvements.	A Split-Merge MCMC Algorithm for the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process
1801.09150v1	Modern vehicles are equipped with increasingly complex sensors. These sensors generate large volumes of data that provide opportunities for modeling and analysis. Here, we are interested in exploiting this data to learn aspects of behaviors and the road network associated with individual drivers. Our dataset is collected on a standard vehicle used to commute to work and for personal trips. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained on the GPS position and orientation data is utilized to compress the large amount of position information into a small amount of road segment states. Each state has a set of observations, i.e. car signals, associated with it that are quantized and modeled as draws from a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). The inference for the topic distributions is carried out using HDP split-merge sampling algorithm. The topic distributions over joint quantized car signals characterize the driving situation in the respective road state. In a novel manner, we demonstrate how the sparsity of the personal road network of a driver in conjunction with a hierarchical topic model allows data driven predictions about destinations as well as likely road conditions.	Bayesian Nonparametric Modeling of Driver Behavior using HDP Split-Merge  Sampling Algorithm
1711.02475v1	Well-established methods for the solution of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) typically struggle in problems with high-dimensional inputs/outputs. Such difficulties are only amplified in large-scale applications where even a few tens of full-order model runs are impractical. While dimensionality reduction can alleviate some of these issues, it is not known which and how many features of the (high-dimensional) input are actually predictive of the (high-dimensional) output. In this paper, we advocate a Bayesian formulation that is capable of performing simultaneous dimension and model-order reduction. It consists of a component that encodes the high-dimensional input into a low-dimensional set of feature functions by employing sparsity-enforcing priors and a decoding component that makes use of the solution of a coarse-grained model in order to reconstruct that of the full-order model. Both components are represented with latent variables in a probabilistic graphical model and are simultaneously trained using Stochastic Variational Inference methods. The model is capable of quantifying the predictive uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place in any model-order/dimension reduction as well as the uncertainty arising from finite-sized training datasets. We demonstrate its capabilities in the context of random media where fine-scale fluctuations can give rise to random inputs with tens of thousands of variables. With a few tens of full-order model simulations, the proposed model is capable of identifying salient physical features and produce sharp predictions under different boundary conditions of the full output which itself consists of thousands of components.

1709.08135v1	As renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) penetrate the power grid at an accelerating speed, it is essential for operators to have accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) energy forecasting for efficient operations and planning. Generally, observed weather data are applied in the solar PV generation forecasting model while in practice the energy forecasting is based on forecasted weather data. In this paper, a study on the uncertainty in weather forecasting for the most commonly used weather variables is presented. The forecasted weather data for six days ahead is compared with the observed data and the results of analysis are quantified by statistical metrics. In addition, the most influential weather predictors in energy forecasting model are selected. The performance of historical and observed weather data errors is assessed using a solar PV generation forecasting model. Finally, a sensitivity test is performed to identify the influential weather variables whose accurate values can significantly improve the results of energy forecasting.

1107.2848v1	In this paper we develop a randomized block-coordinate descent method for minimizing the sum of a smooth and a simple nonsmooth block-separable convex function and prove that it obtains an $\epsilon$-accurate solution with probability at least $1-\rho$ in at most $O(\tfrac{n}{\epsilon} \log \tfrac{1}{\rho})$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of blocks. For strongly convex functions the method converges linearly. This extends recent results of Nesterov [Efficiency of coordinate descent methods on huge-scale optimization problems, CORE Discussion Paper #2010/2], which cover the smooth case, to composite minimization, while at the same time improving the complexity by the factor of 4 and removing $\epsilon$ from the logarithmic term. More importantly, in contrast with the aforementioned work in which the author achieves the results by applying the method to a regularized version of the objective function with an unknown scaling factor, we show that this is not necessary, thus achieving true iteration complexity bounds. In the smooth case we also allow for arbitrary probability vectors and non-Euclidean norms. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that the algorithm is able to solve huge-scale $\ell_1$-regularized least squares and support vector machine problems with a billion variables.	Iteration Complexity of Randomized Block-Coordinate Descent Methods for  Minimizing a Composite Function
1702.06234v2	Many statistical learning problems can be posed as minimization of a sum of two convex functions, one typically a composition of non-smooth and linear functions. Examples include regression under structured sparsity assumptions. Popular algorithms for solving such problems, e.g., ADMM, often involve non-trivial optimization subproblems or smoothing approximation. We consider two classes of primal-dual algorithms that do not incur these difficulties, and unify them from a perspective of monotone operator theory. From this unification we propose a continuum of preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting algorithms amenable to parallel and distributed computing. For the entire region of convergence of the whole continuum of algorithms, we establish its rates of convergence. For some known instances of this continuum, our analysis closes the gap in theory. We further exploit the unification to propose a continuum of accelerated algorithms. We show that the whole continuum attains the theoretically optimal rate of convergence. The scalability of the proposed algorithms, as well as their convergence behavior, is demonstrated up to 1.2 million variables with a distributed implementation.

0811.3579v3	We present a procedure for effective estimation of entropy and mutual information from small-sample data, and apply it to the problem of inferring high-dimensional gene association networks. Specifically, we develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, we show that it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. We illustrate the approach by analyzing E. coli gene expression data and computing an entropy-based gene-association network from gene expression data. A computer program is available that implements the proposed shrinkage estimator.	Entropy inference and the James-Stein estimator, with application to  nonlinear gene association networks
1310.5543v2	Kernel methods have been widely applied to machine learning and other questions of approximating an unknown function from its finite sample data. To ensure arbitrary accuracy of such approximation, various denseness conditions are imposed on the selected kernel. This note contributes to the study of universal, characteristic, and $C_0$-universal kernels. We first give simple and direct description of the difference and relation among these three kinds of universalities of kernels. We then focus on translation-invariant and weighted polynomial kernels. A simple and shorter proof of the known characterization of characteristic translation-invariant kernels will be presented. The main purpose of the note is to give a delicate discussion on the universalities of weighted polynomial kernels.	Universalities of Reproducing Kernels Revisited
1307.2715v1	Community detection in graphs has been the subject of many algorithms. Recent methods want to optimize a modularity function which shows a maximum of relationships within communities and found a minimum of inter-community relations. these algorithms are applied to unipartite, multipartite and directed graphs. However, given the NP-completeness of the problem, these algorithms are heuristics that do not guarantee an optimum. In this paper we introduce an algorithm which, based on an approximate solution obtained through a efficient detection algorithm, modifie it to achieve a local optimum based on a function. this reassignment function is a potential function and therefore the computed optimum is a Nash equilibrium. We supplement our method with an overlap function that allows to have simultaneously the two detection modes. Several experiments show the interest of our approach.

1205.2629v1	Score matching is a recently developed parameter learning method that is particularly effective to complicated high dimensional density models with intractable partition functions. In this paper, we study two issues that have not been completely resolved for score matching. First, we provide a formal link between maximum likelihood and score matching. Our analysis shows that score matching finds model parameters that are more robust with noisy training data. Second, we develop a generalization of score matching. Based on this generalization, we further demonstrate an extension of score matching to models of discrete data.	Interpretation and Generalization of Score Matching
0808.2337v1	We consider principal component analysis (PCA) in decomposable Gaussian graphical models. We exploit the prior information in these models in order to distribute its computation. For this purpose, we reformulate the problem in the sparse inverse covariance (concentration) domain and solve the global eigenvalue problem using a sequence of local eigenvalue problems in each of the cliques of the decomposable graph. We demonstrate the application of our methodology in the context of decentralized anomaly detection in the Abilene backbone network. Based on the topology of the network, we propose an approximate statistical graphical model and distribute the computation of PCA.	Decomposable Principal Component Analysis
1406.2784v1	We study the problem of low-rank tensor factorization in the presence of missing data. We ask the following question: how many sampled entries do we need, to efficiently and exactly reconstruct a tensor with a low-rank orthogonal decomposition? We propose a novel alternating minimization based method which iteratively refines estimates of the singular vectors. We show that under certain standard assumptions, our method can recover a three-mode $n\times n\times n$ dimensional rank-$r$ tensor exactly from $O(n^{3/2} r^5 \log^4 n)$ randomly sampled entries. In the process of proving this result, we solve two challenging sub-problems for tensors with missing data. First, in the process of analyzing the initialization step, we prove a generalization of a celebrated result by Szemer\'edie et al. on the spectrum of random graphs. Next, we prove global convergence of alternating minimization with a good initialization. Simulations suggest that the dependence of the sample size on dimensionality $n$ is indeed tight.

1606.00113v1	Imaging genetic research has essentially focused on discovering unique and co-association effects, but typically ignoring to identify outliers or atypical objects in genetic as well as non-genetics variables. Identifying significant outliers is an essential and challenging issue for imaging genetics and multiple sources data analysis. Therefore, we need to examine for transcription errors of identified outliers. First, we address the influence function (IF) of kernel mean element, kernel covariance operator, kernel cross-covariance operator, kernel canonical correlation analysis (kernel CCA) and multiple kernel CCA. Second, we propose an IF of multiple kernel CCA, which can be applied for more than two datasets. Third, we propose a visualization method to detect influential observations of multiple sources of data based on the IF of kernel CCA and multiple kernel CCA. Finally, the proposed methods are capable of analyzing outliers of subjects usually found in biomedical applications, in which the number of dimension is large. To examine the outliers, we use the stem-and-leaf display. Experiments on both synthesized and imaging genetics data (e.g., SNP, fMRI, and DNA methylation) demonstrate that the proposed visualization can be applied effectively.

1510.06779v3	We present tree- and list- structured density estimation methods for high dimensional binary/categorical data. Our density estimation models are high dimensional analogies to variable bin width histograms. In each leaf of the tree (or list), the density is constant, similar to the flat density within the bin of a histogram. Histograms, however, cannot easily be visualized in higher dimensions, whereas our models can. The accuracy of histograms fades as dimensions increase, whereas our models have priors that help with generalization. Our models are sparse, unlike high-dimensional histograms. We present three generative models, where the first one allows the user to specify the number of desired leaves in the tree within a Bayesian prior. The second model allows the user to specify the desired number of branches within the prior. The third model returns lists (rather than trees) and allows the user to specify the desired number of rules and the length of rules within the prior. Our results indicate that the new approaches yield a better balance between sparsity and accuracy of density estimates than other methods for this task.

1610.02920v2	Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are successful deep generative models. GANs are based on a two-player minimax game. However, the objective function derived in the original motivation is changed to obtain stronger gradients when learning the generator. We propose a novel algorithm that repeats the density ratio estimation and f-divergence minimization. Our algorithm offers a new perspective toward the understanding of GANs and is able to make use of multiple viewpoints obtained in the research of density ratio estimation, e.g. what divergence is stable and relative density ratio is useful.

1709.05667v1	Principal component analysis (PCA) is very popular to perform dimension reduction. The selection of the number of significant components is essential but often based on some practical heuristics depending on the application. Only few works have proposed a probabilistic approach able to infer the number of significant components. To this purpose, this paper introduces a Bayesian nonparametric principal component analysis (BNP-PCA). The proposed model projects observations onto a random orthogonal basis which is assigned a prior distribution defined on the Stiefel manifold. The prior on factor scores involves an Indian buffet process to model the uncertainty related to the number of components. The parameters of interest as well as the nuisance parameters are finally inferred within a fully Bayesian framework via Monte Carlo sampling. A study of the (in-)consistence of the marginal maximum a posteriori estimator of the latent dimension is carried out. A new estimator of the subspace dimension is proposed. Moreover, for sake of statistical significance, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based on the posterior distribution of the principal components is used to refine this estimate. The behaviour of the algorithm is first studied on various synthetic examples. Finally, the proposed BNP dimension reduction approach is shown to be easily yet efficiently coupled with clustering or latent factor models within a unique framework.

0812.1949v1	We obtain an index of the complexity of a random sequence by allowing the role of the measure in classical probability theory to be played by a function we call the generating mechanism. Typically, this generating mechanism will be a finite automata. We generate a set of biased sequences by applying a finite state automata with a specified number, $m$, of states to the set of all binary sequences. Thus we can index the complexity of our random sequence by the number of states of the automata. We detail optimal algorithms to predict sequences generated in this way.	Prediction with Restricted Resources and Finite Automata
1202.3717v1	Bayesian priors offer a compact yet general means of incorporating domain knowledge into many learning tasks. The correctness of the Bayesian analysis and inference, however, largely depends on accuracy and correctness of these priors. PAC-Bayesian methods overcome this problem by providing bounds that hold regardless of the correctness of the prior distribution. This paper introduces the first PAC-Bayesian bound for the batch reinforcement learning problem with function approximation. We show how this bound can be used to perform model-selection in a transfer learning scenario. Our empirical results confirm that PAC-Bayesian policy evaluation is able to leverage prior distributions when they are informative and, unlike standard Bayesian RL approaches, ignore them when they are misleading.	PAC-Bayesian Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning
0912.1128v1	After building a classifier with modern tools of machine learning we typically have a black box at hand that is able to predict well for unseen data. Thus, we get an answer to the question what is the most likely label of a given unseen data point. However, most methods will provide no answer why the model predicted the particular label for a single instance and what features were most influential for that particular instance. The only method that is currently able to provide such explanations are decision trees. This paper proposes a procedure which (based on a set of assumptions) allows to explain the decisions of any classification method.	How to Explain Individual Classification Decisions
1103.4023v1	Gaussian Process (GP) models are often used as mathematical approximations of computationally expensive experiments. Provided that its kernel is suitably chosen and that enough data is available to obtain a reasonable fit of the simulator, a GP model can beneficially be used for tasks such as prediction, optimization, or Monte-Carlo-based quantification of uncertainty. However, the former conditions become unrealistic when using classical GPs as the dimension of input increases. One popular alternative is then to turn to Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), relying on the assumption that the simulator's response can approximately be decomposed as a sum of univariate functions. If such an approach has been successfully applied in approximation, it is nevertheless not completely compatible with the GP framework and its versatile applications. The ambition of the present work is to give an insight into the use of GPs for additive models by integrating additivity within the kernel, and proposing a parsimonious numerical method for data-driven parameter estimation. The first part of this article deals with the kernels naturally associated to additive processes and the properties of the GP models based on such kernels. The second part is dedicated to a numerical procedure based on relaxation for additive kernel parameter estimation. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated and compared to other approaches on Sobol's g-function.	Additive Kernels for Gaussian Process Modeling
1405.1580v1	When I first encountered PAC-Bayesian concentration inequalities they seemed to me to be rather disconnected from good old-fashioned results like Hoeffding's and Bernstein's inequalities. But, at least for one flavour of the PAC-Bayesian bounds, there is actually a very close relation, and the main innovation is a continuous version of the union bound, along with some ingenious applications. Here's the gist of what's going on, presented from a machine learning perspective.	PAC-Bayes Mini-tutorial: A Continuous Union Bound
1707.09688v2	Two-sample feature selection is the problem of finding features that describe a difference between two probability distributions, which is a ubiquitous problem in both scientific and engineering studies. However, existing methods have limited applicability because of their restrictive assumptions on data distributoins or computational difficulty. In this paper, we resolve these difficulties by formulating the problem as a sparsest $k$-subgraph problem. The proposed method is nonparametric and does not assume any specific parametric models on the data distributions. We show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and does not require any extra computation for model selection. Moreover, we prove that the proposed method provides a consistent estimator of features under mild conditions. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the current method with regard to both accuracy and computation time.

1802.05664v1	We study optimal covariate balance for causal inferences from observational data when rich covariates and complex relationships necessitate flexible modeling with neural networks. Standard approaches such as propensity weighting and matching/balancing fail in such settings due to miscalibrated propensity nets and inappropriate covariate representations, respectively. We propose a new method based on adversarial training of a weighting and a discriminator network that effectively addresses this methodological gap. This is demonstrated through new theoretical characterizations of the method as well as empirical results using both fully connected architectures to learn complex relationships and convolutional architectures to handle image confounders, showing how this new method can enable strong causal analyses in these challenging settings.

1502.05700v2	Bayesian optimization is an effective methodology for the global optimization of functions with expensive evaluations. It relies on querying a distribution over functions defined by a relatively cheap surrogate model. An accurate model for this distribution over functions is critical to the effectiveness of the approach, and is typically fit using Gaussian processes (GPs). However, since GPs scale cubically with the number of observations, it has been challenging to handle objectives whose optimization requires many evaluations, and as such, massively parallelizing the optimization. In this work, we explore the use of neural networks as an alternative to GPs to model distributions over functions. We show that performing adaptive basis function regression with a neural network as the parametric form performs competitively with state-of-the-art GP-based approaches, but scales linearly with the number of data rather than cubically. This allows us to achieve a previously intractable degree of parallelism, which we apply to large scale hyperparameter optimization, rapidly finding competitive models on benchmark object recognition tasks using convolutional networks, and image caption generation using neural language models.	Scalable Bayesian Optimization Using Deep Neural Networks
1506.05843v1	Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions. For example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children's names in a given state and year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions. In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency between the draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the preceding nucleotides, children's names are highly correlated from year to year, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic. These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here, we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in P\'olya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead.	Dependent Multinomial Models Made Easy: Stick Breaking with the  Pólya-Gamma Augmentation
1711.08536v1	Modern machine learning systems such as image classifiers rely heavily on large scale data sets for training. Such data sets are costly to create, thus in practice a small number of freely available, open source data sets are widely used. We suggest that examining the geo-diversity of open data sets is critical before adopting a data set for use cases in the developing world. We analyze two large, publicly available image data sets to assess geo-diversity and find that these data sets appear to exhibit an observable amerocentric and eurocentric representation bias. Further, we analyze classifiers trained on these data sets to assess the impact of these training distributions and find strong differences in the relative performance on images from different locales. These results emphasize the need to ensure geo-representation when constructing data sets for use in the developing world.

1506.04000v1	Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs. Code to replicate each experiment in this paper will be available shortly.	MCMC for Variationally Sparse Gaussian Processes

We propose a fast approximate online SSL algorithm that solves for the harmonic solution on an approximate graph. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that good behavior can be achieved by collapsing nearby points into a set of local ""representative points"" that minimize distortion. Moreover, we regularize the harmonic solution to achieve better stability properties. We apply our algorithm to face recognition and optical character recognition applications to show that we can take advantage of the manifold structure to outperform the previous methods. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we show that our method yields provable performance bounds."	Online Semi-Supervised Learning on Quantized Graphs
1705.07362v1	The waggle dance that honeybees perform is an astonishing way of communicating the location of food source. After over 60 years of its discovery, researchers still use manual labeling by watching hours of dance videos to detect different transitions between dance components thus extracting information regarding the distance and direction to the food source. We propose an automated process to monitor and segment different components of honeybee waggle dance. The process is highly accurate, runs in real-time, and can use shared information between multiple dances.	Honey Bee Dance Modeling in Real-time using Machine Learning
1012.3476v1	Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) have attracted a lot of attention of late, as one the principle building blocks of deep networks. Training RBMs remains problematic however, because of the intractibility of their partition function. The maximum likelihood gradient requires a very robust sampler which can accurately sample from the model despite the loss of ergodicity often incurred during learning. While using Parallel Tempering in the negative phase of Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML-PT) helps address the issue, it imposes a trade-off between computational complexity and high ergodicity, and requires careful hand-tuning of the temperatures. In this paper, we show that this trade-off is unnecessary. The choice of optimal temperatures can be automated by minimizing average return time (a concept first proposed by [Katzgraber et al., 2006]) while chains can be spawned dynamically, as needed, thus minimizing the computational overhead. We show on a synthetic dataset, that this results in better likelihood scores.	Adaptive Parallel Tempering for Stochastic Maximum Likelihood Learning  of RBMs
0907.4643v2	We discuss here the mean-field theory for a cellular automata model of meta-learning. The meta-learning is the process of combining outcomes of individual learning procedures in order to determine the final decision with higher accuracy than any single learning method. Our method is constructed from an ensemble of interacting, learning agents, that acquire and process incoming information using various types, or different versions of machine learning algorithms. The abstract learning space, where all agents are located, is constructed here using a fully connected model that couples all agents with random strength values. The cellular automata network simulates the higher level integration of information acquired from the independent learning trials. The final classification of incoming input data is therefore defined as the stationary state of the meta-learning system using simple majority rule, yet the minority clusters that share opposite classification outcome can be observed in the system. Therefore, the probability of selecting proper class for a given input data, can be estimated even without the prior knowledge of its affiliation. The fuzzy logic can be easily introduced into the system, even if learning agents are build from simple binary classification machine learning algorithms by calculating the percentage of agreeing agents.	Mean-Field Theory of Meta-Learning
1205.1053v1	In latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), topics are multinomial distributions over the entire vocabulary. However, the vocabulary usually contains many words that are not relevant in forming the topics. We adopt a variable selection method widely used in statistical modeling as a dimension reduction tool and combine it with LDA. In this variable selection model for LDA (vsLDA), topics are multinomial distributions over a subset of the vocabulary, and by excluding words that are not informative for finding the latent topic structure of the corpus, vsLDA finds topics that are more robust and discriminative. We compare three models, vsLDA, LDA with symmetric priors, and LDA with asymmetric priors, on heldout likelihood, MCMC chain consistency, and document classification. The performance of vsLDA is better than symmetric LDA for likelihood and classification, better than asymmetric LDA for consistency and classification, and about the same in the other comparisons.

1704.05201v6	We propose a novel adaptive importance sampling algorithm which incorporates Stein variational gradient decent algorithm (SVGD) with importance sampling (IS). Our algorithm leverages the nonparametric transforms in SVGD to iteratively decrease the KL divergence between our importance proposal and the target distribution. The advantages of this algorithm are twofold: first, our algorithm turns SVGD into a standard IS algorithm, allowing us to use standard diagnostic and analytic tools of IS to evaluate and interpret the results; second, we do not restrict the choice of our importance proposal to predefined distribution families like traditional (adaptive) IS methods. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm performs well on evaluating partition functions of restricted Boltzmann machines and testing likelihood of variational auto-encoders.

1705.07006v4	Analyzing the underlying structure of multiple time-sequences provides insight into the understanding of social networks and human activities. In this work, we present the Bayesian nonparametric Poisson process allocation (BaNPPA), a generative model to automatically infer the number of latent functions in temporal data. We model the intensity of each sequence as an infinite mixture of latent functions, each of which is the square of a function drawn from a Gaussian process. A technical challenge for the inference of such mixture models is the identifiability issue between coefficients and the scale of latent functions. We propose to cope with the identifiability issue by regulating the volume of each latent function and derive a variational inference algorithm that can scale well to large-scale data sets. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and scalable to large-scale datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed Bayesian nonparametric model through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets.

1205.4656v2	We demonstrate an equivalence between reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embeddings of conditional distributions and vector-valued regressors. This connection introduces a natural regularized loss function which the RKHS embeddings minimise, providing an intuitive understanding of the embeddings and a justification for their use. Furthermore, the equivalence allows the application of vector-valued regression methods and results to the problem of learning conditional distributions. Using this link we derive a sparse version of the embedding by considering alternative formulations. Further, by applying convergence results for vector-valued regression to the embedding problem we derive minimax convergence rates which are O(\log(n)/n) -- compared to current state of the art rates of O(n^{-1/4}) -- and are valid under milder and more intuitive assumptions. These minimax upper rates coincide with lower rates up to a logarithmic factor, showing that the embedding method achieves nearly optimal rates. We study our sparse embedding algorithm in a reinforcement learning task where the algorithm shows significant improvement in sparsity over an incomplete Cholesky decomposition.

1702.03537v2	We propose a framework for modeling and estimating the state of controlled dynamical systems, where an agent can affect the system through actions and receives partial observations. Based on this framework, we propose the Predictive State Representation with Random Fourier Features (RFFPSR). A key property in RFF-PSRs is that the state estimate is represented by a conditional distribution of future observations given future actions. RFF-PSRs combine this representation with moment-matching, kernel embedding and local optimization to achieve a method that enjoys several favorable qualities: It can represent controlled environments which can be affected by actions; it has an efficient and theoretically justified learning algorithm; it uses a non-parametric representation that has expressive power to represent continuous non-linear dynamics. We provide a detailed formulation, a theoretical analysis and an experimental evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

1709.05276v1	We compare two statistical models of three binary random variables. One is a mixture model and the other is a product of mixtures model called a restricted Boltzmann machine. Although the two models we study look different from their parametrizations, we show that they represent the same set of distributions on the interior of the probability simplex, and are equal up to closure. We give a semi-algebraic description of the model in terms of six binomial inequalities and obtain closed form expressions for the maximum likelihood estimates. We briefly discuss extensions to larger models.	Mixtures and products in two graphical models
1505.02065v6	We introduce a novel approach for estimating Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) parameters from collapsed Gibbs samples (CGS), by leveraging the full conditional distributions over the latent variable assignments to efficiently average over multiple samples, for little more computational cost than drawing a single additional collapsed Gibbs sample. Our approach can be understood as adapting the soft clustering methodology of Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB0) to CGS parameter estimation, in order to get the best of both techniques. Our estimators can straightforwardly be applied to the output of any existing implementation of CGS, including modern accelerated variants. We perform extensive empirical comparisons of our estimators with those of standard collapsed inference algorithms on real-world data for both unsupervised LDA and Prior-LDA, a supervised variant of LDA for multi-label classification. Our results show a consistent advantage of our approach over traditional CGS under all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 inference in the majority of conditions. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of averaging over multiple samples in LDA parameter estimation, and the use of efficient computational techniques to do so.

1603.07602v1	Investigations have been performed into using clustering methods in data mining time-series data from smart meters. The problem is to identify patterns and trends in energy usage profiles of commercial and industrial customers over 24-hour periods, and group similar profiles. We tested our method on energy usage data provided by several U.S. power utilities. The results show accurate grouping of accounts similar in their energy usage patterns, and potential for the method to be utilized in energy efficiency programs.

1701.05305v2	Random forest (RF) missing data algorithms are an attractive approach for dealing with missing data. They have the desirable properties of being able to handle mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity, and they have the potential to scale to big data settings. Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms but relatively little guidance about their efficacy, which motivated us to study their performance. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting---the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Performance of algorithms was assessed by ability to impute data accurately. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing not at random.	Random Forest Missing Data Algorithms
1511.01987v1	Currently, machine learning plays an important role in the lives and individual activities of numerous people. Accordingly, it has become necessary to design machine learning algorithms to ensure that discrimination, biased views, or unfair treatment do not result from decision making or predictions made via machine learning. In this work, we introduce a novel empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework for supervised learning, neutralized ERM (NERM) that ensures that any classifiers obtained can be guaranteed to be neutral with respect to a viewpoint hypothesis. More specifically, given a viewpoint hypothesis, NERM works to find a target hypothesis that minimizes the empirical risk while simultaneously identifying a target hypothesis that is neutral to the viewpoint hypothesis. Within the NERM framework, we derive a theoretical bound on empirical and generalization neutrality risks. Furthermore, as a realization of NERM with linear classification, we derive a max-margin algorithm, neutral support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that our neutral SVM shows improved classification performance in real datasets without sacrificing the neutrality guarantee.

1608.07597v3	Kernel-based K-means clustering has gained popularity due to its simplicity and the power of its implicit non-linear representation of the data. A dominant concern is the memory requirement since memory scales as the square of the number of data points. We provide a new analysis of a class of approximate kernel methods that have more modest memory requirements, and propose a specific one-pass randomized kernel approximation followed by standard K-means on the transformed data. The analysis and experiments suggest the method is accurate, while requiring drastically less memory than standard kernel K-means and significantly less memory than Nystrom based approximations.	A Randomized Approach to Efficient Kernel Clustering
0710.0845v3	We present the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP), a stochastic process which assigns probability distributions to infinitely-deep, infinitely-branching trees. We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian nonparametric model of document collections. Specifically, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm finds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientific abstracts from several journals. This model exemplifies a recent trend in statistical machine learning--the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on flexible data structures.

1304.6803v5	We propose a new method for detecting changes in Markov network structure between two sets of samples. Instead of naively fitting two Markov network models separately to the two data sets and figuring out their difference, we \emph{directly} learn the network structure change by estimating the ratio of Markov network models. This density-ratio formulation naturally allows us to introduce sparsity in the network structure change, which highly contributes to enhancing interpretability. Furthermore, computation of the normalization term, which is a critical bottleneck of the naive approach, can be remarkably mitigated. We also give the dual formulation of the optimization problem, which further reduces the computation cost for large-scale Markov networks. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method.	Direct Learning of Sparse Changes in Markov Networks by Density Ratio  Estimation
1607.08601v1	We prove a central limit theorem for the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to the $d$ largest eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian matrix of a finite dimensional random dot product graph. As a corollary, we show that for stochastic blockmodel graphs, the rows of the spectral embedding of the normalized Laplacian converge to multivariate normals and furthermore the mean and the covariance matrix of each row are functions of the associated vertex's block membership. Together with prior results for the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, we then compare, via the Chernoff information between multivariate normal distributions, how the choice of embedding method impacts subsequent inference. We demonstrate that neither embedding method dominates with respect to the inference task of recovering the latent block assignments.	Limit theorems for eigenvectors of the normalized Laplacian for random  graphs
1505.06659v1	We consider statistical and algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. Prior results show that, from an \emph{algorithmic perspective}, when using sketching matrices constructed from random projections and leverage-score sampling, if the number of samples $r$ much smaller than the original sample size $n$, then the worst-case (WC) error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a very small relative error. From a \emph{statistical perspective}, one typically considers the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data are generated according to a statistical linear model. In this paper, we provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing, in a unified manner, algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $r$ is much smaller than $n$, while the PE typically requires the number of samples $r$ to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent work show that our upper bounds on PE can not be improved.	Statistical and Algorithmic Perspectives on Randomized Sketching for  Ordinary Least-Squares -- ICML
1205.2614v1	Products of Hidden Markov Models(PoHMMs) are an interesting class of generative models which have received little attention since their introduction. This maybe in part due to their more computationally expensive gradient-based learning algorithm,and the intractability of computing the log likelihood of sequences under the model. In this paper, we demonstrate how the partition function can be estimated reliably via Annealed Importance Sampling. We perform experiments using contrastive divergence learning on rainfall data and data captured from pairs of people dancing. Our results suggest that advances in learning and evaluation for undirected graphical models and recent increases in available computing power make PoHMMs worth considering for complex time-series modeling tasks.

1103.4789v3	We present the discrete infinite logistic normal distribution (DILN), a Bayesian nonparametric prior for mixed membership models. DILN is a generalization of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that models correlation structure between the weights of the atoms at the group level. We derive a representation of DILN as a normalized collection of gamma-distributed random variables, and study its statistical properties. We consider applications to topic modeling and derive a variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference. We study the empirical performance of the DILN topic model on four corpora, comparing performance with the HDP and the correlated topic model (CTM). To deal with large-scale data sets, we also develop an online inference algorithm for DILN and compare with online HDP and online LDA on the Nature magazine, which contains approximately 350,000 articles.	The Discrete Infinite Logistic Normal Distribution
1008.3952v1	Kernel Induced Random Survival Forests (KIRSF) is a statistical learning algorithm which aims to improve prediction accuracy for survival data. As in Random Survival Forests (RSF), Cumulative Hazard Function is predicted for each individual in the test set. Prediction error is estimated using Harrell's concordance index (C index) [Harrell et al. (1982)]. The C-index can be interpreted as a misclassification probability and does not depend on a single fixed time for evaluation. The C-index also specifically accounts for censoring. By utilizing kernel functions, KIRSF achieves better results than RSF in many situations. In this report, we show how to incorporate kernel functions into RSF. We test the performance of KIRSF and compare our method to RSF. We find that the KIRSF's performance is better than RSF in many occasions.	Kernel induced random survival forests
1610.06545v3	"The goal of two-sample tests is to assess whether two samples, $S_P \sim P^n$ and $S_Q \sim Q^m$, are drawn from the same distribution. Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the $n$ examples in $S_P$ with a positive label, and by pairing the $m$ examples in $S_Q$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis ""$P = Q$"" is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level. As we will show, such Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where $P$ and $Q$ differ. The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST. First, we analyze their main theoretical properties. Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives. Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery."	Revisiting Classifier Two-Sample Tests
1705.07592v1	Identifying a set of homogeneous clusters in a heterogeneous dataset is one of the most important classes of problems in statistical modeling. In the realm of unsupervised partitional clustering, k-means is a very important algorithm for this. In this technical report, we develop a new k-means variant called Augmented k-means, which is a hybrid of k-means and logistic regression. During each iteration, logistic regression is used to predict the current cluster labels, and the cluster belonging probabilities are used to control the subsequent re-estimation of cluster means. Observations which can't be firmly identified into clusters are excluded from the re-estimation step. This can be valuable when the data exhibit many characteristics of real datasets such as heterogeneity, non-sphericity, substantial overlap, and high scatter. Augmented k-means frequently outperforms k-means by more accurately classifying observations into known clusters and / or converging in fewer iterations. We demonstrate this on both simulated and real datasets. Our algorithm is implemented in Python and will be available with this report.	Improved Clustering with Augmented k-means
1305.6526v3	We study the adaptive estimation of copula correlation matrix $\Sigma$ for the semi-parametric elliptical copula model. In this context, the correlations are connected to Kendall's tau through a sine function transformation. Hence, a natural estimate for $\Sigma$ is the plug-in estimator $\hat{\Sigma}$ with Kendall's tau statistic. We first obtain a sharp bound on the operator norm of $\hat{\Sigma}-\Sigma$. Then we study a factor model of $\Sigma$, for which we propose a refined estimator $\widetilde{\Sigma}$ by fitting a low-rank matrix plus a diagonal matrix to $\hat{\Sigma}$ using least squares with a nuclear norm penalty on the low-rank matrix. The bound on the operator norm of $\hat{\Sigma}-\Sigma$ serves to scale the penalty term, and we obtain finite sample oracle inequalities for $\widetilde{\Sigma}$. We also consider an elementary factor copula model of $\Sigma$, for which we propose closed-form estimators. All of our estimation procedures are entirely data-driven.

1307.0373v1	The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central problem in the analysis of financial time series. A common approach is to express these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function is assumed to be constant but this may be inaccurate when there are covariates that could have a large influence on the dependence structure of the data. To account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other time-varying copula methods.

1111.5479v2	"The graphical lasso \citep{FHT2007a} is an algorithm for learning the structure in an undirected Gaussian graphical model, using $\ell_1$ regularization to control the number of zeros in the precision matrix ${\B\Theta}={\B\Sigma}^{-1}$ \citep{BGA2008,yuan_lin_07}. The {\texttt R} package \GL\ \citep{FHT2007a} is popular, fast, and allows one to efficiently build a path of models for different values of the tuning parameter. Convergence of \GL\ can be tricky; the converged precision matrix might not be the inverse of the estimated covariance, and occasionally it fails to converge with warm starts. In this paper we explain this behavior, and propose new algorithms that appear to outperform \GL. By studying the ""normal equations"" we see that, \GL\ is solving the {\em dual} of the graphical lasso penalized likelihood, by block coordinate ascent; a result which can also be found in \cite{BGA2008}. In this dual, the target of estimation is $\B\Sigma$, the covariance matrix, rather than the precision matrix $\B\Theta$. We propose similar primal algorithms \PGL\ and \DPGL, that also operate by block-coordinate descent, where $\B\Theta$ is the optimization target. We study all of these algorithms, and in particular different approaches to solving their coordinate sub-problems. We conclude that \DPGL\ is superior from several points of view."

1205.3181v1	We study the problem of identifying the top $m$ arms in a multi-armed bandit game. Our proposed solution relies on a new algorithm based on successive rejects of the seemingly bad arms, and successive accepts of the good ones. This algorithmic contribution allows to tackle other multiple identifications settings that were previously out of reach. In particular we show that this idea of successive accepts and rejects applies to the multi-bandit best arm identification problem.	Multiple Identifications in Multi-Armed Bandits
1005.5337v1	Rapid identification of object from radar cross section (RCS) signals is important for many space and military applications. This identification is a problem in pattern recognition which either neural networks or support vector machines should prove to be high-speed. Bayesian networks would also provide value but require significant preprocessing of the signals. In this paper, we describe the use of a support vector machine for object identification from synthesized RCS data. Our best results are from data fusion of X-band and S-band signals, where we obtained 99.4%, 95.3%, 100% and 95.6% correct identification for cylinders, frusta, spheres, and polygons, respectively. We also compare our results with a Bayesian approach and show that the SVM is three orders of magnitude faster, as measured by the number of floating point operations.

0904.0977v1	The class of chain event graph models is a generalisation of the class of discrete Bayesian networks, retaining most of the structural advantages of the Bayesian network for model interrogation, propagation and learning, while more naturally encoding asymmetric state spaces and the order in which events happen. In this paper we demonstrate how with complete sampling, conjugate closed form model selection based on product Dirichlet priors is possible, and prove that suitable homogeneity assumptions characterise the product Dirichlet prior on this class of models. We demonstrate our techniques using two educational examples.	Bayesian MAP Model Selection of Chain Event Graphs
1612.09297v1	We propose communication-efficient distributed estimation and inference methods for the transelliptical graphical model, a semiparametric extension of the elliptical distribution in the high dimensional regime. In detail, the proposed method distributes the $d$-dimensional data of size $N$ generated from a transelliptical graphical model into $m$ worker machines, and estimates the latent precision matrix on each worker machine based on the data of size $n=N/m$. It then debiases the local estimators on the worker machines and send them back to the master machine. Finally, on the master machine, it aggregates the debiased local estimators by averaging and hard thresholding. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimator based on all the data, provided that the number of machines satisfies $m \lesssim \min\{N\log d/d,\sqrt{N/(s^2\log d)}\}$, where $s$ is the maximum number of nonzero entries in each column of the latent precision matrix. It is worth noting that our algorithm and theory can be directly applied to Gaussian graphical models, Gaussian copula graphical models and elliptical graphical models, since they are all special cases of transelliptical graphical models. Thorough experiments on synthetic data back up our theory.	Communication-efficient Distributed Estimation and Inference for  Transelliptical Graphical Models
0909.0991v1	We present in this work a new family of kernels to compare positive measures on arbitrary spaces $\Xcal$ endowed with a positive kernel $\kappa$, which translates naturally into kernels between histograms or clouds of points. We first cover the case where $\Xcal$ is Euclidian, and focus on kernels which take into account the variance matrix of the mixture of two measures to compute their similarity. The kernels we define are semigroup kernels in the sense that they only use the sum of two measures to compare them, and spectral in the sense that they only use the eigenspectrum of the variance matrix of this mixture. We show that such a family of kernels has close bonds with the laplace transforms of nonnegative-valued functions defined on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, and we present some closed formulas that can be derived as special cases of such integral expressions. By focusing further on functions which are invariant to the addition of a null eigenvalue to the spectrum of the variance matrix, we can define kernels between atomic measures on arbitrary spaces $\Xcal$ endowed with a kernel $\kappa$ by using directly the eigenvalues of the centered Gram matrix of the joined support of the compared measures. We provide explicit formulas suited for applications and present preliminary experiments to illustrate the interest of the approach.	Kernels for Measures Defined on the Gram Matrix of their Support
1802.05400v1	Scaling Bayesian optimization to high dimensions is challenging task as the global optimization of high-dimensional acquisition function can be expensive and often infeasible. Existing methods depend either on limited active variables or the additive form of the objective function. We propose a new method for high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, that uses a dropout strategy to optimize only a subset of variables at each iteration. We derive theoretical bounds for the regret and show how it can inform the derivation of our algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms for optimization on two benchmark functions and two real-world applications- training cascade classifiers and optimizing alloy composition.

1501.05108v5	Graphical models provide powerful tools to uncover complicated patterns in multivariate data and are commonly used in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we introduce an R package BDgraph which performs Bayesian structure learning for general undirected graphical models with either continuous or discrete variables. The package efficiently implements recent improvements in the Bayesian literature. To speed up computations, the computationally intensive tasks have been implemented in C++ and interfaced with R. In addition, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as two multivariate datasets taken from the literature and are used to describe the package capabilities. The paper includes a brief overview of the statistical methods which have been implemented in the package. The main body of the paper explains how to use the package. Furthermore, we illustrate the package's functionality in both real and artificial examples, as well as in an extensive simulation study.

A covariance-based dissimilarity measure and consistent algorithms are designed for clustering offline and online data settings, respectively. We also suggest a formal criterion on the efficiency of dissimilarity measures, and discuss of some approach to improve the efficiency of clustering algorithms, when they are applied to cluster particular type of processes, such as self-similar processes with wide-sense stationary ergodic increments. Clustering synthetic data sampled from fractional Brownian motions is provided as an example of application.

1711.09514v2	This paper investigates asymptotic behaviors of gradient descent algorithms (particularly accelerated gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent) in the context of stochastic optimization arose in statistics and machine learning where objective functions are estimated from available data. We show that these algorithms can be modeled by continuous-time ordinary or stochastic differential equations, and their asymptotic dynamic evolutions and distributions are governed by some linear ordinary or stochastic differential equations, as the data size goes to infinity. We illustrate that our study can provide a novel unified framework for a joint computational and statistical asymptotic analysis on dynamic behaviors of these algorithms with the time (or the number of iterations in the algorithms) and large sample behaviors of the statistical decision rules (like estimators and classifiers) that the algorithms are applied to compute, where the statistical decision rules are the limits of the random sequences generated from these iterative algorithms as the number of iterations goes to infinity.

1501.02579v1	Using a Bayesian approach, we consider the problem of recovering sparse signals under additive sparse and dense noise. Typically, sparse noise models outliers, impulse bursts or data loss. To handle sparse noise, existing methods simultaneously estimate the sparse signal of interest and the sparse noise of no interest. For estimating the sparse signal, without the need of estimating the sparse noise, we construct a robust Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). In the RVM, sparse noise and ever present dense noise are treated through a combined noise model. The precision of combined noise is modeled by a diagonal matrix. We show that the new RVM update equations correspond to a non-symmetric sparsity inducing cost function. Further, the combined modeling is found to be computationally more efficient. We also extend the method to block-sparse signals and noise with known and unknown block structures. Through simulations, we show the performance and computation efficiency of the new RVM in several applications: recovery of sparse and block sparse signals, housing price prediction and image denoising.

1508.01019v1	A typical goal of supervised dimension reduction is to find a low-dimensional subspace of the input space such that the projected input variables preserve maximal information about the output variables. The dependence maximization approach solves the supervised dimension reduction problem through maximizing a statistical dependence between projected input variables and output variables. A well-known statistical dependence measure is mutual information (MI) which is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, it is known that the KL divergence is sensitive to outliers. On the other hand, quadratic MI (QMI) is a variant of MI based on the $L_2$ distance which is more robust against outliers than the KL divergence, and a computationally efficient method to estimate QMI from data, called least-squares QMI (LSQMI), has been proposed recently. For these reasons, developing a supervised dimension reduction method based on LSQMI seems promising. However, not QMI itself, but the derivative of QMI is needed for subspace search in supervised dimension reduction, and the derivative of an accurate QMI estimator is not necessarily a good estimator of the derivative of QMI. In this paper, we propose to directly estimate the derivative of QMI without estimating QMI itself. We show that the direct estimation of the derivative of QMI is more accurate than the derivative of the estimated QMI. Finally, we develop a supervised dimension reduction algorithm which efficiently uses the proposed derivative estimator, and demonstrate through experiments that the proposed method is more robust against outliers than existing methods.	Direct Estimation of the Derivative of Quadratic Mutual Information with  Application in Supervised Dimension Reduction
1310.6062v1	We introduce a computationally effective algorithm for a linear model selection consisting of three steps: screening--ordering--selection (SOS). Screening of predictors is based on the thresholded Lasso that is l_1 penalized least squares. The screened predictors are then fitted using least squares (LS) and ordered with respect to their t statistics. Finally, a model is selected using greedy generalized information criterion (GIC) that is l_0 penalized LS in a nested family induced by the ordering. We give non-asymptotic upper bounds on error probability of each step of the SOS algorithm in terms of both penalties. Then we obtain selection consistency for different (n, p) scenarios under conditions which are needed for screening consistency of the Lasso. For the traditional setting (n >p) we give Sanov-type bounds on the error probabilities of the ordering--selection algorithm. Its surprising consequence is that the selection error of greedy GIC is asymptotically not larger than of exhaustive GIC. We also obtain new bounds on prediction and estimation errors for the Lasso which are proved in parallel for the algorithm used in practice and its formal version.

1802.03877v1	"Learning using privileged information is an attractive problem setting that helps many learning scenarios in the real world. A state-of-the-art method of Gaussian process classification (GPC) with privileged information is GPC+, which incorporates privileged information into a noise term of the likelihood. A drawback of GPC+ is that it requires numerical quadrature to calculate the posterior distribution of the latent function, which is extremely time-consuming. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel classification method with privileged information based on Gaussian processes, called ""soft-label-transferred Gaussian process (SLT-GP)."" Our basic idea is that we construct another learning task of predicting soft labels (continuous values) obtained from privileged information and we perform transfer learning from this task to the target task of predicting hard labels. We derive a PAC-Bayesian bound of our proposed method, which justifies optimizing hyperparameters by the empirical Bayes method. We also experimentally show the usefulness of our proposed method compared with GPC and GPC+."	Gaussian Process Classification with Privileged Information by  Soft-to-Hard Labeling Transfer
1301.1318v4	Partitioning a graph into groups of vertices such that those within each group are more densely connected than vertices assigned to different groups, known as graph clustering, is often used to gain insight into the organisation of large scale networks and for visualisation purposes. Whereas a large number of dedicated techniques have been recently proposed for static graphs, the design of on-line graph clustering methods tailored for evolving networks is a challenging problem, and much less documented in the literature. Motivated by the broad variety of applications concerned, ranging from the study of biological networks to the analysis of networks of scientific references through the exploration of communications networks such as the World Wide Web, it is the main purpose of this paper to introduce a novel, computationally efficient, approach to graph clustering in the evolutionary context. Namely, the method promoted in this article can be viewed as an incremental eigenvalue solution for the spectral clustering method described by Ng. et al. (2001). The incremental eigenvalue solution is a general technique for finding the approximate eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix given a change. As well as outlining the approach in detail, we present a theoretical bound on the quality of the approximate eigenvectors using perturbation theory. We then derive a novel spectral clustering algorithm called Incremental Approximate Spectral Clustering (IASC). The IASC algorithm is simple to implement and its efficacy is demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets modelling the evolution of a HIV epidemic, a citation network and the purchase history graph of an e-commerce website.

1106.2494v2	We introduce the Pitman Yor Diffusion Tree (PYDT) for hierarchical clustering, a generalization of the Dirichlet Diffusion Tree (Neal, 2001) which removes the restriction to binary branching structure. The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary.

1410.6984v1	Portable, Wearable and Wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) Systems have the potential to be used as point-of-care for cardiovascular disease diagnostic systems. Such wearable and wireless ECG systems require automatic detection of cardiovascular disease. Even in the primary care, automation of ECG diagnostic systems will improve efficiency of ECG diagnosis and reduce the minimal training requirement of local healthcare workers. However, few fully automatic myocardial infarction (MI) disease detection algorithms have well been developed. This paper presents a novel automatic MI classification algorithm using second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with time varying coefficients, which simultaneously captures morphological and dynamic feature of highly correlated ECG signals. By effectively estimating the unobserved state variables and the parameters of the second order ODE, the accuracy of the classification was significantly improved. The estimated time varying coefficients of the second order ODE were used as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) for the MI classification. The proposed method was applied to the PTB diagnostic ECG database within Physionet. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and classification accuracy of 12 lead ECGs for MI binary classifications were 98.7%, 96.4% and 98.3%, respectively. We also found that even using one lead ECG signals, we can reach accuracy as high as 97%. Multiclass MI classification is a challenging task but the developed ODE approach for 12 lead ECGs coupled with multiclass SVM reached 96.4% accuracy for classifying 5 subgroups of MI and healthy controls.

1610.02490v4	We propose a nonparametric sequential test that aims to address two practical problems pertinent to online randomized experiments: (i) how to do a hypothesis test for complex metrics; (ii) how to prevent type $1$ error inflation under continuous monitoring. The proposed test does not require knowledge of the underlying probability distribution generating the data. We use the bootstrap to estimate the likelihood for blocks of data followed by mixture sequential probability ratio test. We validate this procedure on data from a major online e-commerce website. We show that the proposed test controls type $1$ error at any time, has good power, is robust to misspecification in the distribution generating the data, and allows quick inference in online randomized experiments.	A nonparametric sequential test for online randomized experiments
1506.02239v1	We introduce a new class of nonstationary kernels, which we derive as covariance functions of a novel family of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs). We construct string GPs to allow for multiple types of local patterns in the data, while ensuring a mild global regularity condition. In this paper, we illustrate the efficacy of the approach using synthetic data and demonstrate that the model outperforms competing approaches on well studied, real-life datasets that exhibit nonstationary features.	String Gaussian Process Kernels
1012.3795v2	We study the problem of estimating a temporally varying coefficient and varying structure (VCVS) graphical model underlying nonstationary time series data, such as social states of interacting individuals or microarray expression profiles of gene networks, as opposed to i.i.d. data from an invariant model widely considered in current literature of structural estimation. In particular, we consider the scenario in which the model evolves in a piece-wise constant fashion. We propose a procedure that minimizes the so-called TESLA loss (i.e., temporally smoothed L1 regularized regression), which allows jointly estimating the partition boundaries of the VCVS model and the coefficient of the sparse precision matrix on each block of the partition. A highly scalable proximal gradient method is proposed to solve the resultant convex optimization problem; and the conditions for sparsistent estimation and the convergence rate of both the partition boundaries and the network structure are established for the first time for such estimators.	Estimating Networks With Jumps
1406.7321v2	We consider the class of optimization problems arising from computationally intensive L1-regularized M-estimators, where the function or gradient values are very expensive to compute. A particular instance of interest is the L1-regularized MLE for learning Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which are a popular class of statistical models for varied structured prediction problems such as sequence labeling, alignment, and classification with label taxonomy. L1-regularized MLEs for CRFs are particularly expensive to optimize since computing the gradient values requires an expensive inference step. In this work, we propose the use of a carefully constructed proximal quasi-Newton algorithm for such computationally intensive M-estimation problems, where we employ an aggressive active set selection technique. In a key contribution of the paper, we show that the proximal quasi-Newton method is provably super-linearly convergent, even in the absence of strong convexity, by leveraging a restricted variant of strong convexity. In our experiments, the proposed algorithm converges considerably faster than current state-of-the-art on the problems of sequence labeling and hierarchical classification.	Proximal Quasi-Newton for Computationally Intensive L1-regularized  M-estimators
0707.3536v1	Dendrograms used in data analysis are ultrametric spaces, hence objects of nonarchimedean geometry. It is known that there exist $p$-adic representation of dendrograms. Completed by a point at infinity, they can be viewed as subtrees of the Bruhat-Tits tree associated to the $p$-adic projective line. The implications are that certain moduli spaces known in algebraic geometry are $p$-adic parameter spaces of (families of) dendrograms, and stochastic classification can also be handled within this framework. At the end, we calculate the topology of the hidden part of a dendrogram.	Degenerating families of dendrograms
1411.4378v1	"While robust parameter estimation has been well studied in parametric density estimation, there has been little investigation into robust density estimation in the nonparametric setting. We present a robust version of the popular kernel density estimator (KDE). As with other estimators, a robust version of the KDE is useful since sample contamination is a common issue with datasets. What ""robustness"" means for a nonparametric density estimate is not straightforward and is a topic we explore in this paper. To construct a robust KDE we scale the traditional KDE and project it to its nearest weighted KDE in the $L^2$ norm. This yields a scaled and projected KDE (SPKDE). Because the squared $L^2$ norm penalizes point-wise errors superlinearly this causes the weighted KDE to allocate more weight to high density regions. We demonstrate the robustness of the SPKDE with numerical experiments and a consistency result which shows that asymptotically the SPKDE recovers the uncontaminated density under sufficient conditions on the contamination."

1501.06103v1	A statistical test of independence may be constructed using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a test statistic. The HSIC is defined as the distance between the embedding of the joint distribution, and the embedding of the product of the marginals, in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). It has previously been shown that when the kernel used in defining the joint embedding is characteristic (that is, the embedding of the joint distribution to the feature space is injective), then the HSIC-based test is consistent. In particular, it is sufficient for the product of kernels on the individual domains to be characteristic on the joint domain. In this note, it is established via a result of Lyons (2013) that HSIC-based independence tests are consistent when kernels on the marginals are characteristic on their respective domains, even when the product of kernels is not characteristic on the joint domain.	A simpler condition for consistency of a kernel independence test
1701.04207v1	Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a multivariate statistical technique for finding the linear relationship between two sets of variables. The kernel generalization of CCA named kernel CCA has been proposed to find nonlinear relations between datasets. Despite their wide usage, they have one common limitation that is the lack of sparsity in their solution. In this paper, we consider sparse kernel CCA and propose a novel sparse kernel CCA algorithm (SKCCA). Our algorithm is based on a relationship between kernel CCA and least squares. Sparsity of the dual transformations is introduced by penalizing the $\ell_{1}$-norm of dual vectors. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm not only performs well in computing sparse dual transformations but also can alleviate the over-fitting problem of kernel CCA.

1508.01240v1	Calibration refers to the process of adjusting features of a computational model that are not observed in the physical process so that the model matches the real process. We propose a framework for calibration when the unobserved features, i.e. calibration parameters, do not assume a single value, but are functionally dependent on other inputs. We demonstrate that this problem is curve to surface matching where the matched curve does not possess the same length as the original curve. Therefore, we perform non-isometric matching of a curve to a surface. Since in practical applications we do not observe a continuous curve but a sample of data points, we use a graph-theoretic approach to solve this matching of incomplete data. We define a graph structure in which the nodes are selected from the incomplete surface and the weights of the edges are decided based on the response values of the curve and surface. We show that the problem of non-isometric incomplete curve to surface matching is a shortest path problem in a directed acyclic graph. We apply the proposed method, graph-theoretic non-isometric matching, to real and synthetic data and demonstrate that the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy in functional calibration.	Non-isometric Curve to Surface Matching with Incomplete Data for  Functional Calibration
1711.07910v1	Domain generalization is the problem of assigning class labels to an unlabeled test data set, given several labeled training data sets drawn from similar distributions. This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of biological, technical, or other sources of variation. We develop a distribution-free, kernel-based approach that predicts a classifier from the marginal distribution of features, by leveraging the trends present in related classification tasks. This approach involves identifying an appropriate reproducing kernel Hilbert space and optimizing a regularized empirical risk over the space. We present generalization error analysis, describe universal kernels, and establish universal consistency of the proposed methodology. Experimental results on synthetic data and three real data applications demonstrate the superiority of the method with respect to a pooling strategy.	Domain Generalization by Marginal Transfer Learning
1606.02261v1	"Monte Carlo (MC) sampling algorithms are an extremely widely-used technique to estimate expectations of functions f(x), especially in high dimensions. Control variates are a very powerful technique to reduce the error of such estimates, but in their conventional form rely on having an accurate approximation of f, a priori. Stacked Monte Carlo (StackMC) is a recently introduced technique designed to overcome this limitation by fitting a control variate to the data samples themselves. Done naively, forming a control variate to the data would result in overfitting, typically worsening the MC algorithm's performance. StackMC uses in-sample / out-sample techniques to remove this overfitting. Crucially, it is a post-processing technique, requiring no additional samples, and can be applied to data generated by any MC estimator. Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that StackMC improved the estimates of expectations when it was used to post-process samples produces by a ""simple sampling"" MC estimator. Here we substantially extend this earlier work. We provide an in-depth analysis of the StackMC algorithm, which we use to construct an improved version of the original algorithm, with lower estimation error. We then perform experiments of StackMC on several additional kinds of MC estimators, demonstrating improved performance when the samples are generated via importance sampling, Latin-hypercube sampling and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. We also show how to extend StackMC to combine multiple fitting functions, and how to apply it to discrete input spaces x."	Reducing the error of Monte Carlo Algorithms by Learning Control  Variates
1711.00799v2	"Modeling sequential data has become more and more important in practice. Some applications are autonomous driving, virtual sensors and weather forecasting. To model such systems so called recurrent models are used. In this article we introduce two new Deep Recurrent Gaussian Process (DRGP) models based on the Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (SSGP) and the improved variational version called Variational Sparse Spectrum Gaussian Process (VSSGP). We follow the recurrent structure given by an existing DRGP based on a specific sparse Nystr\""om approximation. Therefore, we also variationally integrate out the input-space and hence can propagate uncertainty through the layers. We can show that for the resulting lower bound an optimal variational distribution exists. Training is realized through optimizing the variational lower bound. Using Distributed Variational Inference (DVI), we can reduce the computational complexity. We improve over current state of the art methods in prediction accuracy for experimental data-sets used for their evaluation and introduce a new data-set for engine control, named Emission. Furthermore, our method can easily be adapted for unsupervised learning, e.g. the latent variable model and its deep version."	Deep Recurrent Gaussian Process with Variational Sparse Spectrum  Approximation
1203.3483v1	We propose a new method for estimating the intrinsic dimension of a dataset by applying the principle of regularized maximum likelihood to the distances between close neighbors. We propose a regularization scheme which is motivated by divergence minimization principles. We derive the estimator by a Poisson process approximation, argue about its convergence properties and apply it to a number of simulated and real datasets. We also show it has the best overall performance compared with two other intrinsic dimension estimators.	Regularized Maximum Likelihood for Intrinsic Dimension Estimation
1706.07258v1	This paper describes an expectation propagation (EP) method for multi-class classification with Gaussian processes that scales well to very large datasets. In such a method the estimate of the log-marginal-likelihood involves a sum across the data instances. This enables efficient training using stochastic gradients and mini-batches. When this type of training is used, the computational cost does not depend on the number of data instances $N$. Furthermore, extra assumptions in the approximate inference process make the memory cost independent of $N$. The consequence is that the proposed EP method can be used on datasets with millions of instances. We compare empirically this method with alternative approaches that approximate the required computations using variational inference. The results show that it performs similar or even better than these techniques, which sometimes give significantly worse predictive distributions in terms of the test log-likelihood. Besides this, the training process of the proposed approach also seems to converge in a smaller number of iterations.	Scalable Multi-Class Gaussian Process Classification using Expectation  Propagation
0909.2904v2	Structural equation models and Bayesian networks have been widely used to study causal relationships between continuous variables. Recently, a non-Gaussian method called LiNGAM was proposed to discover such causal models and has been extended in various directions. An important problem with LiNGAM is that the results are affected by the random sampling of the data as with any statistical method. Thus, some analysis of the statistical reliability or confidence level should be conducted. A common method to evaluate a confidence level is a bootstrap method. However, a confidence level computed by ordinary bootstrap method is known to be biased as a probability-value ($p$-value) of hypothesis testing. In this paper, we propose a new procedure to apply an advanced bootstrap method called multiscale bootstrap to compute confidence levels, i.e., p-values, of LiNGAM outputs. The multiscale bootstrap method gives unbiased $p$-values with asymptotic much higher accuracy. Experiments on artificial data demonstrate the utility of our approach.	Computing p-values of LiNGAM outputs via Multiscale Bootstrap
1609.06764v3	We extend the adaptive regression spline model by incorporating saturation, the natural requirement that a function extend as a constant outside a certain range. We fit saturating splines to data using a convex optimization problem over a space of measures, which we solve using an efficient algorithm based on the conditional gradient method. Unlike many existing approaches, our algorithm solves the original infinite-dimensional (for splines of degree at least two) optimization problem without pre-specified knot locations. We then adapt our algorithm to fit generalized additive models with saturating splines as coordinate functions and show that the saturation requirement allows our model to simultaneously perform feature selection and nonlinear function fitting. Finally, we briefly sketch how the method can be extended to higher order splines and to different requirements on the extension outside the data range.	Saturating Splines and Feature Selection
1602.01182v2	Regularized discriminant analysis (RDA), proposed by Friedman (1989), is a widely popular classifier that lacks interpretability and is impractical for high-dimensional data sets. Here, we present an interpretable and computationally efficient classifier called high-dimensional RDA (HDRDA), designed for the small-sample, high-dimensional setting. For HDRDA, we show that each training observation, regardless of class, contributes to the class covariance matrix, resulting in an interpretable estimator that borrows from the pooled sample covariance matrix. Moreover, we show that HDRDA is equivalent to a classifier in a reduced-feature space with dimension approximately equal to the training sample size. As a result, the matrix operations employed by HDRDA are computationally linear in the number of features, making the classifier well-suited for high-dimensional classification in practice. We demonstrate that HDRDA is often superior to several sparse and regularized classifiers in terms of classification accuracy with three artificial and six real high-dimensional data sets. Also, timing comparisons between our HDRDA implementation in the sparsediscrim R package and the standard RDA formulation in the klaR R package demonstrate that as the number of features increases, the computational runtime of HDRDA is drastically smaller than that of RDA.

1704.08769v1	Daytime hypoglycemia should be accurately predicted to achieve normoglycemia and to avoid disastrous situations. Hypoglycemia, an abnormally low blood glucose level, is divided into daytime hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Many studies of hypoglycemia prevention deal with nocturnal hypoglycemia. In this paper, we propose new predictor variables to predict daytime hypoglycemia using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. We apply classification and regression tree (CART) as a prediction method. The independent variables of our prediction model are the rate of decrease from a peak and absolute level of the BG at the decision point. The evaluation results showed that our model was able to detect almost 80% of hypoglycemic events 15 min in advance, which was higher than the existing methods with similar conditions. The proposed method might achieve a real-time prediction as well as can be embedded into BG monitoring device.	Prediction of Daytime Hypoglycemic Events Using Continuous Glucose  Monitoring Data and Classification Technique
1604.04054v1	We consider a statistical inverse learning problem, where we observe the image of a function $f$ through a linear operator $A$ at i.i.d. random design points $X_i$, superposed with an additive noise. The distribution of the design points is unknown and can be very general. We analyze simultaneously the direct (estimation of $Af$) and the inverse (estimation of $f$) learning problems. In this general framework, we obtain strong and weak minimax optimal rates of convergence (as the number of observations $n$ grows large) for a large class of spectral regularization methods over regularity classes defined through appropriate source conditions. This improves on or completes previous results obtained in related settings. The optimality of the obtained rates is shown not only in the exponent in $n$ but also in the explicit dependency of the constant factor in the variance of the noise and the radius of the source condition set.	Optimal Rates For Regularization Of Statistical Inverse Learning  Problems
1003.0783v1	We introduce supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA), a statistical model of labelled documents. The model accommodates a variety of response types. We derive an approximate maximum-likelihood procedure for parameter estimation, which relies on variational methods to handle intractable posterior expectations. Prediction problems motivate this research: we use the fitted model to predict response values for new documents. We test sLDA on two real-world problems: movie ratings predicted from reviews, and the political tone of amendments in the U.S. Senate based on the amendment text. We illustrate the benefits of sLDA versus modern regularized regression, as well as versus an unsupervised LDA analysis followed by a separate regression.	Supervised Topic Models
1409.4011v1	In practical Bayesian optimization, we must often search over structures with differing numbers of parameters. For instance, we may wish to search over neural network architectures with an unknown number of layers. To relate performance data gathered for different architectures, we define a new kernel for conditional parameter spaces that explicitly includes information about which parameters are relevant in a given structure. We show that this kernel improves model quality and Bayesian optimization results over several simpler baseline kernels.	Raiders of the Lost Architecture: Kernels for Bayesian Optimization in  Conditional Parameter Spaces
1504.07468v3	We consider the problem of discriminative factor analysis for data that are in general non-Gaussian. A Bayesian model based on the ranks of the data is proposed. We first introduce a new {\em max-margin} version of the rank-likelihood. A discriminative factor model is then developed, integrating the max-margin rank-likelihood and (linear) Bayesian support vector machines, which are also built on the max-margin principle. The discriminative factor model is further extended to the {\em nonlinear} case through mixtures of local linear classifiers, via Dirichlet processes. Fully local conjugacy of the model yields efficient inference with both Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes approaches. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real data demonstrate superior performance of the proposed model and its potential for applications in computational biology.

1108.2989v1	"Boosting combines weak classifiers to form highly accurate predictors. Although the case of binary classification is well understood, in the multiclass setting, the ""correct"" requirements on the weak classifier, or the notion of the most efficient boosting algorithms are missing. In this paper, we create a broad and general framework, within which we make precise and identify the optimal requirements on the weak-classifier, as well as design the most effective, in a certain sense, boosting algorithms that assume such requirements."

1101.5435v1	Existing approaches to analyzing the asymptotics of graph Laplacians typically assume a well-behaved kernel function with smoothness assumptions. We remove the smoothness assumption and generalize the analysis of graph Laplacians to include previously unstudied graphs including kNN graphs. We also introduce a kernel-free framework to analyze graph constructions with shrinking neighborhoods in general and apply it to analyze locally linear embedding (LLE). We also describe how for a given limiting Laplacian operator desirable properties such as a convergent spectrum and sparseness can be achieved choosing the appropriate graph construction.	An Analysis of the Convergence of Graph Laplacians
1201.6082v1	In many situations where the interest lies in identifying clusters one might expect that not all available variables carry information about these groups. Furthermore, data quality (e.g. outliers or missing entries) might present a serious and sometimes hard-to-assess problem for large and complex datasets. In this paper we show that a small proportion of atypical observations might have serious adverse effects on the solutions found by the sparse clustering algorithm of Witten and Tibshirani (2010). We propose a robustification of their sparse K-means algorithm based on the trimmed K-means algorithm of Cuesta-Albertos et al. (1997) Our proposal is also able to handle datasets with missing values. We illustrate the use of our method on microarray data for cancer patients where we are able to identify strong biological clusters with a much reduced number of genes. Our simulation studies show that, when there are outliers in the data, our robust sparse K-means algorithm performs better than other competing methods both in terms of the selection of features and also the identified clusters. This robust sparse K-means algorithm is implemented in the R package RSKC which is publicly available from the CRAN repository.	A robust and sparse K-means clustering algorithm
1008.5071v4	Spontaneous brain activity, as observed in functional neuroimaging, has been shown to display reproducible structure that expresses brain architecture and carries markers of brain pathologies. An important view of modern neuroscience is that such large-scale structure of coherent activity reflects modularity properties of brain connectivity graphs. However, to date, there has been no demonstration that the limited and noisy data available in spontaneous activity observations could be used to learn full-brain probabilistic models that generalize to new data. Learning such models entails two main challenges: i) modeling full brain connectivity is a difficult estimation problem that faces the curse of dimensionality and ii) variability between subjects, coupled with the variability of functional signals between experimental runs, makes the use of multiple datasets challenging. We describe subject-level brain functional connectivity structure as a multivariate Gaussian process and introduce a new strategy to estimate it from group data, by imposing a common structure on the graphical model in the population. We show that individual models learned from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using this population prior generalize better to unseen data than models based on alternative regularization schemes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cross-validated model of spontaneous brain activity. Finally, we use the estimated graphical model to explore the large-scale characteristics of functional architecture and show for the first time that known cognitive networks appear as the integrated communities of functional connectivity graph.

1311.0622v1	We propose a new stochastic dual coordinate ascent technique that can be applied to a wide range of regularized learning problems. Our method is based on Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) to deal with complex regularization functions such as structured regularizations. Although the original ADMM is a batch method, the proposed method offers a stochastic update rule where each iteration requires only one or few sample observations. Moreover, our method can naturally afford mini-batch update and it gives speed up of convergence. We show that, under mild assumptions, our method converges exponentially. The numerical experiments show that our method actually performs efficiently.	Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent with Alternating Direction Multiplier  Method
1010.2770v1	Despite the recent progress towards efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL), the structured output case remains an open research front. Current approaches involve repeatedly solving a batch learning problem, which makes them inadequate for large scale scenarios. We propose a new family of online proximal algorithms for MKL (as well as for group-lasso and variants thereof), which overcomes that drawback. We show regret, convergence, and generalization bounds for the proposed method. Experiments on handwriting recognition and dependency parsing testify for the successfulness of the approach.	Online Multiple Kernel Learning for Structured Prediction
0811.1067v2	We propose a number of techniques for obtaining a global ranking from data that may be incomplete and imbalanced -- characteristics almost universal to modern datasets coming from e-commerce and internet applications. We are primarily interested in score or rating-based cardinal data. From raw ranking data, we construct pairwise rankings, represented as edge flows on an appropriate graph. Our statistical ranking method uses the graph Helmholtzian, the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or scalar Laplacian. We study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge theory: we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the L2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the validity of the global ranking obtained -- if this is large, then the data does not have a meaningful global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow (locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether inconsistency arises locally or globally. An obvious advantage over the NP-hard Kemeny optimization is that discrete Hodge decomposition may be computed via a linear least squares regression. We also investigated the L1-projection of edge flows, showing that this is dual to correlation maximization over bounded divergence-free flows, and the L1-approximate sparse cyclic ranking, showing that this is dual to correlation maximization over bounded curl-free flows. We discuss relations with Kemeny optimization, Borda count, and Kendall-Smith consistency index from social choice theory and statistics.	Statistical ranking and combinatorial Hodge theory
1503.00214v3	This paper considers the problem of matrix completion when the observed entries are noisy and contain outliers. It begins with introducing a new optimization criterion for which the recovered matrix is defined as its solution. This criterion uses the celebrated Huber function from the robust statistics literature to downweigh the effects of outliers. A practical algorithm is developed to solve the optimization involved. This algorithm is fast, straightforward to implement, and monotonic convergent. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is theoretically shown to be stable in a well defined sense. Its promising empirical performance is demonstrated via a sequence of simulation experiments, including image inpainting.	Matrix Completion with Noisy Entries and Outliers
1608.07241v1	The technique of Formal Concept Analysis is applied to a dataset describing the traits of rodents, with the goal of identifying zoonotic disease carriers,or those species carrying infections that can spillover to cause human disease. The concepts identified among these species together provide rules-of-thumb about the intrinsic biological features of rodents that carry zoonotic diseases, and offer utility for better targeting field surveillance efforts in the search for novel disease carriers in the wild.

1112.1217v1	Contemporary global optimization algorithms are based on local measures of utility, rather than a probability measure over location and value of the optimum. They thus attempt to collect low function values, not to learn about the optimum. The reason for the absence of probabilistic global optimizers is that the corresponding inference problem is intractable in several ways. This paper develops desiderata for probabilistic optimization algorithms, then presents a concrete algorithm which addresses each of the computational intractabilities with a sequence of approximations and explicitly adresses the decision problem of maximizing information gain from each evaluation.	Entropy Search for Information-Efficient Global Optimization
1802.03848v3	In this work we consider the problem of model selection in Gaussian Markov fields in the sample deficient scenario. The benchmark information-theoretic results in the case of d-regular graphs require the number of samples to be at least proportional to the logarithm of the number of vertices to allow consistent graph recovery. When the number of samples is less than this amount, reliable detection of all edges is impossible. In many applications, it is more important to learn the distribution of the edge (coupling) parameters over the network than the specific locations of the edges. Assuming that the entire graph can be partitioned into a number of spatial regions with similar edge parameters and reasonably regular boundaries, we develop new information-theoretic sample complexity bounds and show that even bounded number of samples can be enough to consistently recover these regions. We also introduce and analyze an efficient region growing algorithm capable of recovering the regions with high accuracy. We show that it is consistent and demonstrate its performance benefits in synthetic simulations.	Region Detection in Markov Random Fields: Gaussian Case
1101.5734v1	We introduce a recursive adaptive group lasso algorithm for real-time penalized least squares prediction that produces a time sequence of optimal sparse predictor coefficient vectors. At each time index the proposed algorithm computes an exact update of the optimal $\ell_{1,\infty}$-penalized recursive least squares (RLS) predictor. Each update minimizes a convex but nondifferentiable function optimization problem. We develop an online homotopy method to reduce the computational complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the $\ell_1$ regularized RLS algorithm for a group sparse system identification problem and has lower implementation complexity than direct group lasso solvers.

1611.01900v2	We consider the learning algorithms under general source condition with the polynomial decay of the eigenvalues of the integral operator in vector-valued function setting. We discuss the upper convergence rates of Tikhonov regularizer under general source condition corresponding to increasing monotone index function. The convergence issues are studied for general regularization schemes by using the concept of operator monotone index functions in minimax setting. Further we also address the minimum possible error for any learning algorithm.	Optimal rates for the regularized learning algorithms under general  source condition
1108.3154v2	Stability is a general notion that quantifies the sensitivity of a learning algorithm's output to small change in the training dataset (e.g. deletion or replacement of a single training sample). Such conditions have recently been shown to be more powerful to characterize learnability in the general learning setting under i.i.d. samples where uniform convergence is not necessary for learnability, but where stability is both sufficient and necessary for learnability. We here show that similar stability conditions are also sufficient for online learnability, i.e. whether there exists a learning algorithm such that under any sequence of examples (potentially chosen adversarially) produces a sequence of hypotheses that has no regret in the limit with respect to the best hypothesis in hindsight. We introduce online stability, a stability condition related to uniform-leave-one-out stability in the batch setting, that is sufficient for online learnability. In particular we show that popular classes of online learners, namely algorithms that fall in the category of Follow-the-(Regularized)-Leader, Mirror Descent, gradient-based methods and randomized algorithms like Weighted Majority and Hedge, are guaranteed to have no regret if they have such online stability property. We provide examples that suggest the existence of an algorithm with such stability condition might in fact be necessary for online learnability. For the more restricted binary classification setting, we establish that such stability condition is in fact both sufficient and necessary. We also show that for a large class of online learnable problems in the general learning setting, namely those with a notion of sub-exponential covering, no-regret online algorithms that have such stability condition exists.

1512.05698v1	We investigate properties of estimators obtained by minimization of U-processes with the Lasso penalty in high-dimensional settings. Our attention is focused on the ranking problem that is popular in machine learning. It is related to guessing the ordering between objects on the basis of their observed predictors. We prove the oracle inequality for the excess risk of the considered estimator as well as the bound for the l1 distance between the estimator and the oracle.

1106.0134v1	Elucidating the genetic basis of human diseases is a central goal of genetics and molecular biology. While traditional linkage analysis and modern high-throughput techniques often provide long lists of tens or hundreds of disease gene candidates, the identification of disease genes among the candidates remains time-consuming and expensive. Efficient computational methods are therefore needed to prioritize genes within the list of candidates, by exploiting the wealth of information available about the genes in various databases. Here we propose ProDiGe, a novel algorithm for Prioritization of Disease Genes. ProDiGe implements a novel machine learning strategy based on learning from positive and unlabeled examples, which allows to integrate various sources of information about the genes, to share information about known disease genes across diseases, and to perform genome-wide searches for new disease genes. Experiments on real data show that ProDiGe outperforms state-of-the-art methods for the prioritization of genes in human diseases.

1511.03249v3	A method for large scale Gaussian process classification has been recently proposed based on expectation propagation (EP). Such a method allows Gaussian process classifiers to be trained on very large datasets that were out of the reach of previous deployments of EP and has been shown to be competitive with related techniques based on stochastic variational inference. Nevertheless, the memory resources required scale linearly with the dataset size, unlike in variational methods. This is a severe limitation when the number of instances is very large. Here we show that this problem is avoided when stochastic EP is used to train the model.	Stochastic Expectation Propagation for Large Scale Gaussian Process  Classification
1710.11379v2	"Deep generative models provide a systematic way to learn nonlinear data distributions, through a set of latent variables and a nonlinear ""generator"" function that maps latent points into the input space. The nonlinearity of the generator imply that the latent space gives a distorted view of the input space. Under mild conditions, we show that this distortion can be characterized by a stochastic Riemannian metric, and demonstrate that distances and interpolants are significantly improved under this metric. This in turn improves probability distributions, sampling algorithms and clustering in the latent space. Our geometric analysis further reveals that current generators provide poor variance estimates and we propose a new generator architecture with vastly improved variance estimates. Results are demonstrated on convolutional and fully connected variational autoencoders, but the formalism easily generalize to other deep generative models."

1312.1733v2	The performance of spectral clustering can be considerably improved via regularization, as demonstrated empirically in Amini et. al (2012). Here, we provide an attempt at quantifying this improvement through theoretical analysis. Under the stochastic block model (SBM), and its extensions, previous results on spectral clustering relied on the minimum degree of the graph being sufficiently large for its good performance. By examining the scenario where the regularization parameter $\tau$ is large we show that the minimum degree assumption can potentially be removed. As a special case, for an SBM with two blocks, the results require the maximum degree to be large (grow faster than $\log n$) as opposed to the minimum degree. More importantly, we show the usefulness of regularization in situations where not all nodes belong to well-defined clusters. Our results rely on a `bias-variance'-like trade-off that arises from understanding the concentration of the sample Laplacian and the eigen gap as a function of the regularization parameter. As a byproduct of our bounds, we propose a data-driven technique \textit{DKest} (standing for estimated Davis-Kahan bounds) for choosing the regularization parameter. This technique is shown to work well through simulations and on a real data set.	Impact of regularization on Spectral Clustering
1603.03805v2	This paper investigates the phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a signal from the magnitudes of its linear measurements. We develop statistically and computationally efficient algorithms for the situation when the measurements are corrupted by sparse outliers that can take arbitrary values. We propose a novel approach to robustify the gradient descent algorithm by using the sample median as a guide for pruning spurious samples in initialization and local search. Adopting the Poisson loss and the reshaped quadratic loss respectively, we obtain two algorithms termed median-TWF and median-RWF, both of which provably recover the signal from a near-optimal number of measurements when the measurement vectors are composed of i.i.d. Gaussian entries, up to a logarithmic factor, even when a constant fraction of the measurements are adversarially corrupted. We further show that both algorithms are stable in the presence of additional dense bounded noise. Our analysis is accomplished by developing non-trivial concentration results of median-related quantities, which may be of independent interest. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.	Median-Truncated Nonconvex Approach for Phase Retrieval with Outliers
1711.10873v1	Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a technique for unsupervised exploration of multi-channel data widely used in observational sciences. In its classical form, ICA relies on modeling the data as a linear mixture of non-Gaussian independent sources. The problem can be seen as a likelihood maximization problem. We introduce Picard-O, a preconditioned L-BFGS strategy over the set of orthogonal matrices, which can quickly separate both super- and sub-Gaussian signals. It returns the same set of sources as the widely used FastICA algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method is faster and more robust than FastICA on real data.	Faster ICA under orthogonal constraint
1611.02440v2	Game theory finds nowadays a broad range of applications in engineering and machine learning. However, in a derivative-free, expensive black-box context, very few algorithmic solutions are available to find game equilibria. Here, we propose a novel Gaussian-process based approach for solving games in this context. We follow a classical Bayesian optimization framework, with sequential sampling decisions based on acquisition functions. Two strategies are proposed, based either on the probability of achieving equilibrium or on the Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction paradigm. Practical and numerical aspects are discussed in order to enhance the scalability and reduce computation time. Our approach is evaluated on several synthetic game problems with varying number of players and decision space dimensions. We show that equilibria can be found reliably for a fraction of the cost (in terms of black-box evaluations) compared to classical, derivative-based algorithms. The method is available in the R package GPGame available on CRAN at this https URL	A Bayesian optimization approach to find Nash equilibria
1612.05678v1	"In this short report, we discuss an approach to estimating causal graphs in which indicators of causal influence between variables are treated as labels in a machine learning formulation. Available data on the variables of interest are used as ""inputs"" to estimate the labels. We frame the problem as one of semi-supervised learning: available interventional data or background knowledge provide labels on some edges in the graph and the remaining edges are treated as unlabelled objects. To illustrate the key ideas, we consider a simple approach to feature construction (rooted in bivariate kernel density estimation) and embed this within a semi-supervised manifold framework. Results on yeast knockout data demonstrate that the proposed approach can identify causal relationships as validated by unseen interventional experiments. An advantage of the formulation we propose is that by reframing causal discovery as semi-supervised learning, it allows a range of data-driven approaches to be brought to bear on causal discovery, without demanding specification of full probability models or explicit models of underlying mechanisms."	Causal Discovery as Semi-Supervised Learning
1111.6201v4	We consider the problem of learning a linear factor model. We propose a regularized form of principal component analysis (PCA) and demonstrate through experiments with synthetic and real data the superiority of resulting estimates to those produced by pre-existing factor analysis approaches. We also establish theoretical results that explain how our algorithm corrects the biases induced by conventional approaches. An important feature of our algorithm is that its computational requirements are similar to those of PCA, which enjoys wide use in large part due to its efficiency.

1703.08991v2	We implemented several multilabel classification algorithms in the machine learning package mlr. The implemented methods are binary relevance, classifier chains, nested stacking, dependent binary relevance and stacking, which can be used with any base learner that is accessible in mlr. Moreover, there is access to the multilabel classification versions of randomForestSRC and rFerns. All these methods can be easily compared by different implemented multilabel performance measures and resampling methods in the standardized mlr framework. In a benchmark experiment with several multilabel datasets, the performance of the different methods is evaluated.	Multilabel Classification with R Package mlr
1211.3589v3	We study inference and learning based on a sparse coding model with `spike-and-slab' prior. As in standard sparse coding, the model used assumes independent latent sources that linearly combine to generate data points. However, instead of using a standard sparse prior such as a Laplace distribution, we study the application of a more flexible `spike-and-slab' distribution which models the absence or presence of a source's contribution independently of its strength if it contributes. We investigate two approaches to optimize the parameters of spike-and-slab sparse coding: a novel truncated EM approach and, for comparison, an approach based on standard factored variational distributions. The truncated approach can be regarded as a variational approach with truncated posteriors as variational distributions. In applications to source separation we find that both approaches improve the state-of-the-art in a number of standard benchmarks, which argues for the use of `spike-and-slab' priors for the corresponding data domains. Furthermore, we find that the truncated EM approach improves on the standard factored approach in source separation tasks$-$which hints to biases introduced by assuming posterior independence in the factored variational approach. Likewise, on a standard benchmark for image denoising, we find that the truncated EM approach improves on the factored variational approach. While the performance of the factored approach saturates with increasing numbers of hidden dimensions, the performance of the truncated approach improves the state-of-the-art for higher noise levels.

1511.01284v1	In life sciences, the experts generally use empirical knowledge to recode variables, choose interactions and perform selection by classical approach. The aim of this work is to perform automatic learning algorithm for variables selection which can lead to know if experts can be help in they decision or simply replaced by the machine and improve they knowledge and results. The Lasso method can detect the optimal subset of variables for estimation and prediction under some conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which uses automatically all variables available and all interactions. By a double cross-validation combine with Lasso, we select a best subset of variables and with GLM through a simple cross-validation perform predictions. The algorithm assures the stability and the the consistency of estimators.	Lasso based feature selection for malaria risk exposure prediction
1801.01649v1	Computing the partition function $Z$ of a discrete graphical model is a fundamental inference challenge. Since this is computationally intractable, variational approximations are often used in practice. Recently, so-called gauge transformations were used to improve variational lower bounds on $Z$. In this paper, we propose a new gauge-variational approach, termed WMBE-G, which combines gauge transformations with the weighted mini-bucket elimination (WMBE) method. WMBE-G can provide both upper and lower bounds on $Z$, and is easier to optimize than the prior gauge-variational algorithm. We show that WMBE-G strictly improves the earlier WMBE approximation for symmetric models including Ising models with no magnetic field. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of WMBE-G even for generic, nonsymmetric models.	Gauged Mini-Bucket Elimination for Approximate Inference
1706.01338v1	Sparse coding is a core building block in many data analysis and machine learning pipelines. Typically it is solved by relying on generic optimization techniques, such as the Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithm and its accelerated version (ISTA, FISTA). These methods are optimal in the class of first-order methods for non-smooth, convex functions. However, they do not exploit the particular structure of the problem at hand nor the input data distribution. An acceleration using neural networks, coined LISTA, was proposed in Gregor and Le Cun (2010), which showed empirically that one could achieve high quality estimates with few iterations by modifying the parameters of the proximal splitting appropriately. In this paper we study the reasons for such acceleration. Our mathematical analysis reveals that it is related to a specific matrix factorization of the Gram kernel of the dictionary, which attempts to nearly diagonalise the kernel with a basis that produces a small perturbation of the $\ell_1$ ball. When this factorization succeeds, we prove that the resulting splitting algorithm enjoys an improved convergence bound with respect to the non-adaptive version. Moreover, our analysis also shows that conditions for acceleration occur mostly at the beginning of the iterative process, consistent with numerical experiments. We further validate our analysis by showing that on dictionaries where this factorization does not exist, adaptive acceleration fails.

1503.03082v2	Structured sparsity has recently emerged in statistics, machine learning and signal processing as a promising paradigm for learning in high-dimensional settings. All existing methods for learning under the assumption of structured sparsity rely on prior knowledge on how to weight (or how to penalize) individual subsets of variables during the subset selection process, which is not available in general. Inferring group weights from data is a key open research problem in structured sparsity.In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to the problem of group weight learning. We model the group weights as hyperparameters of heavy-tailed priors on groups of variables and derive an approximate inference scheme to infer these hyperparameters. We empirically show that we are able to recover the model hyperparameters when the data are generated from the model, and we demonstrate the utility of learning weights in synthetic and real denoising problems.

1709.01907v1	Reliable uncertainty estimation for time series prediction is critical in many fields, including physics, biology, and manufacturing. At Uber, probabilistic time series forecasting is used for robust prediction of number of trips during special events, driver incentive allocation, as well as real-time anomaly detection across millions of metrics. Classical time series models are often used in conjunction with a probabilistic formulation for uncertainty estimation. However, such models are hard to tune, scale, and add exogenous variables to. Motivated by the recent resurgence of Long Short Term Memory networks, we propose a novel end-to-end Bayesian deep model that provides time series prediction along with uncertainty estimation. We provide detailed experiments of the proposed solution on completed trips data, and successfully apply it to large-scale time series anomaly detection at Uber.

1606.04820v2	Good sparse approximations are essential for practical inference in Gaussian Processes as the computational cost of exact methods is prohibitive for large datasets. The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) and the Variational Free Energy (VFE) approximations are two recent popular methods. Despite superficial similarities, these approximations have surprisingly different theoretical properties and behave differently in practice. We thoroughly investigate the two methods for regression both analytically and through illustrative examples, and draw conclusions to guide practical application.

1612.00595v2	We introduce a novel approach for parallelizing MCMC inference in models with spatially determined conditional independence relationships, for which existing techniques exploiting graphical model structure are not applicable. Our approach is motivated by a model of seismic events and signals, where events detected in distant regions are approximately independent given those in intermediate regions. We perform parallel inference by coloring a factor graph defined over regions of latent space, rather than individual model variables. Evaluating on a model of seismic event detection, we achieve significant speedups over serial MCMC with no degradation in inference quality.	Parallel Chromatic MCMC with Spatial Partitioning
1312.2646v4	The question of how to determine the number of independent latent factors (topics) in mixture models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is of great practical importance. In most applications, the exact number of topics is unknown, and depends on the application and the size of the data set. Bayesian nonparametric methods can avoid the problem of topic number selection, but they can be impracticably slow for large sample sizes and are subject to local optima. We develop a guaranteed procedure for topic number recovery that does not necessitate learning the model's latent parameters beforehand. Our procedure relies on adapting results from random matrix theory. Performance of our topic number recovery procedure is superior to hLDA, a nonparametric method. We also discuss some implications of our results on the sample complexity and accuracy of popular spectral learning algorithms for LDA. Our results and procedure can be extended to spectral learning algorithms for other exchangeable mixture models as well as Hidden Markov Models.

1307.2302v2	"The interaction between transitivity and sparsity, two common features in empirical networks, implies that there are local regions of large sparse networks that are dense. We call this the blessing of transitivity and it has consequences for both modeling and inference. Extant research suggests that statistical inference for the Stochastic Blockmodel is more difficult when the edges are sparse. However, this conclusion is confounded by the fact that the asymptotic limit in all of the previous studies is not merely sparse, but also non-transitive. To retain transitivity, the blocks cannot grow faster than the expected degree. Thus, in sparse models, the blocks must remain asymptotically small. \n Previous algorithmic research demonstrates that small ""local"" clusters are more amenable to computation, visualization, and interpretation when compared to ""global"" graph partitions. This paper provides the first statistical results that demonstrate how these small transitive clusters are also more amenable to statistical estimation. Theorem 2 shows that a ""local"" clustering algorithm can, with high probability, detect a transitive stochastic block of a fixed size (e.g. 30 nodes) embedded in a large graph. The only constraint on the ambient graph is that it is large and sparse--it could be generated at random or by an adversary--suggesting a theoretical explanation for the robust empirical performance of local clustering algorithms."	The blessing of transitivity in sparse and stochastic networks
1411.0073v1	Motivated by generating personalized recommendations using ordinal (or preference) data, we study the question of learning a mixture of MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model, a parameterized class of distributions over permutations, from partial ordinal or preference data (e.g. pair-wise comparisons). Despite its long standing importance across disciplines including social choice, operations research and revenue management, little is known about this question. In case of single MNL models (no mixture), computationally and statistically tractable learning from pair-wise comparisons is feasible. However, even learning mixture with two MNL components is infeasible in general. Given this state of affairs, we seek conditions under which it is feasible to learn the mixture model in both computationally and statistically efficient manner. We present a sufficient condition as well as an efficient algorithm for learning mixed MNL models from partial preferences/comparisons data. In particular, a mixture of $r$ MNL components over $n$ objects can be learnt using samples whose size scales polynomially in $n$ and $r$ (concretely, $r^{3.5}n^3(log n)^4$, with $r\ll n^{2/7}$ when the model parameters are sufficiently incoherent). The algorithm has two phases: first, learn the pair-wise marginals for each component using tensor decomposition; second, learn the model parameters for each component using Rank Centrality introduced by Negahban et al. In the process of proving these results, we obtain a generalization of existing analysis for tensor decomposition to a more realistic regime where only partial information about each sample is available.

0908.2724v1	We present a novel method for solving Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) in a sparse convex framework using a least squares approach. The presented method focuses on the scenario when one is interested in (or limited to) a primal representation for the first view while having a dual representation for the second view. Sparse CCA (SCCA) minimises the number of features used in both the primal and dual projections while maximising the correlation between the two views. The method is demonstrated on two paired corpuses of English-French and English-Spanish for mate-retrieval. We are able to observe, in the mate-retreival, that when the number of the original features is large SCCA outperforms Kernel CCA (KCCA), learning the common semantic space from a sparse set of features.

1012.0975v2	We consider the problem of estimating the inverse covariance matrix by maximizing the likelihood function with a penalty added to encourage the sparsity of the resulting matrix. We propose a new approach based on the split Bregman method to solve the regularized maximum likelihood estimation problem. We show that our method is significantly faster than the widely used graphical lasso method, which is based on blockwise coordinate descent, on both artificial and real-world data. More importantly, different from the graphical lasso, the split Bregman based method is much more general, and can be applied to a class of regularization terms other than the $\ell_1$ norm	Split Bregman Method for Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation with  Matrix Iteration Acceleration

We derive distribution-free deviation bounds with sublinear exponents in deviation size for missing mass and improve the results of Berend and Kontorovich (2013) and Yari Saeed Khanloo and Haffari (2015) for small deviations which is the most important case in learning theory.

1303.2892v1	We consider the problem of adaptive stratified sampling for Monte Carlo integration of a noisy function, given a finite budget n of noisy evaluations to the function. We tackle in this paper the problem of adapting to the function at the same time the number of samples into each stratum and the partition itself. More precisely, it is interesting to refine the partition of the domain in area where the noise to the function, or where the variations of the function, are very heterogeneous. On the other hand, having a (too) refined stratification is not optimal. Indeed, the more refined the stratification, the more difficult it is to adjust the allocation of the samples to the stratification, i.e. sample more points where the noise or variations of the function are larger. We provide in this paper an algorithm that selects online, among a large class of partitions, the partition that provides the optimal trade-off, and allocates the samples almost optimally on this partition.

1704.02060v2	Integrative analysis of disparate data blocks measured on a common set of experimental subjects is a major challenge in modern data analysis. This data structure naturally motivates the simultaneous exploration of the joint and individual variation within each data block resulting in new insights. For instance, there is a strong desire to integrate the multiple genomic data sets in The Cancer Genome Atlas to characterize the common and also the unique aspects of cancer genetics and cell biology for each source. In this paper we introduce Angle-Based Joint and Individual Variation Explained capturing both joint and individual variation within each data block. This is a major improvement over earlier approaches to this challenge in terms of a new conceptual understanding, much better adaption to data heterogeneity and a fast linear algebra computation. Important mathematical contributions are the use of score subspaces as the principal descriptors of variation structure and the use of perturbation theory as the guide for variation segmentation. This leads to an exploratory data analysis method which is insensitive to the heterogeneity among data blocks and does not require separate normalization. An application to cancer data reveals different behaviors of each type of signal in characterizing tumor subtypes. An application to a mortality data set reveals interesting historical lessons.

1410.8372v1	We give a comprehensive theoretical characterization of a nonparametric estimator for the $L_2^2$ divergence between two continuous distributions. We first bound the rate of convergence of our estimator, showing that it is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent provided the densities are sufficiently smooth. In this smooth regime, we then show that our estimator is asymptotically normal, construct asymptotic confidence intervals, and establish a Berry-Ess\'{e}en style inequality characterizing the rate of convergence to normality. We also show that this estimator is minimax optimal.	On Estimating $L_2^2$ Divergence
1607.08310v1	Preterm births occur at an alarming rate of 10-15%. Preemies have a higher risk of infant mortality, developmental retardation and long-term disabilities. Predicting preterm birth is difficult, even for the most experienced clinicians. The most well-designed clinical study thus far reaches a modest sensitivity of 18.2-24.2% at specificity of 28.6-33.3%. We take a different approach by exploiting databases of normal hospital operations. We aims are twofold: (i) to derive an easy-to-use, interpretable prediction rule with quantified uncertainties, and (ii) to construct accurate classifiers for preterm birth prediction. Our approach is to automatically generate and select from hundreds (if not thousands) of possible predictors using stability-aware techniques. Derived from a large database of 15,814 women, our simplified prediction rule with only 10 items has sensitivity of 62.3% at specificity of 81.5%.

1110.4198v3	We present a system and a set of techniques for learning linear predictors with convex losses on terascale datasets, with trillions of features, {The number of features here refers to the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix.} billions of training examples and millions of parameters in an hour using a cluster of 1000 machines. Individually none of the component techniques are new, but the careful synthesis required to obtain an efficient implementation is. The result is, up to our knowledge, the most scalable and efficient linear learning system reported in the literature (as of 2011 when our experiments were conducted). We describe and thoroughly evaluate the components of the system, showing the importance of the various design choices.	A Reliable Effective Terascale Linear Learning System
0712.1027v1	Since their emergence in the 1990's, the support vector machine and the AdaBoost algorithm have spawned a wave of research in statistical machine learning. Much of this new research falls into one of two broad categories: kernel methods and ensemble methods. In this expository article, I discuss the main ideas behind these two types of methods, namely how to transform linear algorithms into nonlinear ones by using kernel functions, and how to make predictions with an ensemble or a collection of models rather than a single model. I also share my personal perspectives on how these ideas have influenced and shaped my own research. In particular, I present two recent algorithms that I have invented with my collaborators: LAGO, a fast kernel algorithm for unbalanced classification and rare target detection; and Darwinian evolution in parallel universes, an ensemble method for variable selection.

1512.06098v2	We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the posterior measure over the trajec- tories of a diffusion process from discrete time observations and continuous time constraints. We cast the problem in a Bayesian framework and derive approximations to the posterior distributions of single time marginals using variational approximate inference. We then show how the approximation can be extended to a wide class of discrete-state Markov jump pro- cesses by making use of the chemical Langevin equation. Our empirical results show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides good approximations for these classes of inverse problems.

1111.5948v1	This paper addresses the problem of segmenting a time-series with respect to changes in the mean value or in the variance. The first case is when the time data is modeled as a sequence of independent and normal distributed random variables with unknown, possibly changing, mean value but fixed variance. The main assumption is that the mean value is piecewise constant in time, and the task is to estimate the change times and the mean values within the segments. The second case is when the mean value is constant, but the variance can change. The assumption is that the variance is piecewise constant in time, and we want to estimate change times and the variance values within the segments. To find solutions to these problems, we will study an l_1 regularized maximum likelihood method, related to the fused lasso method and l_1 trend filtering, where the parameters to be estimated are free to vary at each sample. To penalize variations in the estimated parameters, the l_1-norm of the time difference of the parameters is used as a regularization term. This idea is closely related to total variation denoising. The main contribution is that a convex formulation of this variance estimation problem, where the parametrization is based on the inverse of the variance, can be formulated as a certain l_1 mean estimation problem. This implies that results and methods for mean estimation can be applied to the challenging problem of variance segmentation/estimation.	On l_1 Mean and Variance Filtering
1209.5375v2	Typical cohorts in brain imaging studies are not large enough for systematic testing of all the information contained in the images. To build testable working hypotheses, investigators thus rely on analysis of previous work, sometimes formalized in a so-called meta-analysis. In brain imaging, this approach underlies the specification of regions of interest (ROIs) that are usually selected on the basis of the coordinates of previously detected effects. In this paper, we propose to use a database of images, rather than coordinates, and frame the problem as transfer learning: learning a discriminant model on a reference task to apply it to a different but related new task. To facilitate statistical analysis of small cohorts, we use a sparse discriminant model that selects predictive voxels on the reference task and thus provides a principled procedure to define ROIs. The benefits of our approach are twofold. First it uses the reference database for prediction, i.e. to provide potential biomarkers in a clinical setting. Second it increases statistical power on the new task. We demonstrate on a set of 18 pairs of functional MRI experimental conditions that our approach gives good prediction. In addition, on a specific transfer situation involving different scanners at different locations, we show that voxel selection based on transfer learning leads to higher detection power on small cohorts.

1510.04378v1	In order to identify important variables that are involved in making optimal treatment decision, Lu et al. (2013) proposed a penalized least squared regression framework for a fixed number of predictors, which is robust against the misspecification of the conditional mean model. Two problems arise: (i) in a world of explosively big data, effective methods are needed to handle ultra-high dimensional data set, for example, with the dimension of predictors is of the non-polynomial (NP) order of the sample size; (ii) both the propensity score and conditional mean models need to be estimated from data under NP dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a two-step estimation procedure for deriving the optimal treatment regime under NP dimensionality. In both steps, penalized regressions are employed with the non-concave penalty function, where the conditional mean model of the response given predictors may be misspecified. The asymptotic properties, such as weak oracle properties, selection consistency and oracle distributions, of the proposed estimators are investigated. In addition, we study the limiting distribution of the estimated value function for the obtained optimal treatment regime. The empirical performance of the proposed estimation method is evaluated by simulations and an application to a depression dataset from the STAR*D study.

1107.3600v2	In many scientific disciplines structures in high-dimensional data have to be found, e.g., in stellar spectra, in genome data, or in face recognition tasks. In this work we present a novel approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction. It is based on fitting K-nearest neighbor regression to the unsupervised regression framework for learning of low-dimensional manifolds. Similar to related approaches that are mostly based on kernel methods, unsupervised K-nearest neighbor (UNN) regression optimizes latent variables w.r.t. the data space reconstruction error employing the K-nearest neighbor heuristic. The problem of optimizing latent neighborhoods is difficult to solve, but the UNN formulation allows the design of efficient strategies that iteratively embed latent points to fixed neighborhood topologies. UNN is well appropriate for sorting of high-dimensional data. The iterative variants are analyzed experimentally.	Unsupervised K-Nearest Neighbor Regression
1609.08203v1	Variational inference lies at the core of many state-of-the-art algorithms. To improve the approximation of the posterior beyond parametric families, it was proposed to include MCMC steps into the variational lower bound. In this work we explore this idea using steps of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, an efficient MCMC method. In particular, we incorporate the acceptance step of the HMC algorithm, guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the true posterior. Additionally, we introduce some extensions to the HMC algorithm geared towards faster convergence. The theoretical advantages of these modifications are reflected by performance improvements in our experimental results.	Variational Inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
1505.01582v2	Hypergraph partitioning lies at the heart of a number of problems in machine learning and network sciences. Many algorithms for hypergraph partitioning have been proposed that extend standard approaches for graph partitioning to the case of hypergraphs. However, theoretical aspects of such methods have seldom received attention in the literature as compared to the extensive studies on the guarantees of graph partitioning. For instance, consistency results of spectral graph partitioning under the stochastic block model are well known. In this paper, we present a planted partition model for sparse random non-uniform hypergraphs that generalizes the stochastic block model. We derive an error bound for a spectral hypergraph partitioning algorithm under this model using matrix concentration inequalities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first consistency result related to partitioning non-uniform hypergraphs.	Consistency of Spectral Hypergraph Partitioning under Planted Partition  Model
0912.1618v1	"In this paper, we consider the problem of ""hyper-sparse aggregation"". Namely, given a dictionary $F = \{f_1, ..., f_M \}$ of functions, we look for an optimal aggregation algorithm that writes $\tilde f = \sum_{j=1}^M \theta_j f_j$ with as many zero coefficients $\theta_j$ as possible. This problem is of particular interest when $F$ contains many irrelevant functions that should not appear in $\tilde{f}$. We provide an exact oracle inequality for $\tilde f$, where only two coefficients are non-zero, that entails $\tilde f$ to be an optimal aggregation algorithm. Since selectors are suboptimal aggregation procedures, this proves that 2 is the minimal number of elements of $F$ required for the construction of an optimal aggregation procedures in every situations. A simulated example of this algorithm is proposed on a dictionary obtained using LARS, for the problem of selection of the regularization parameter of the LASSO. We also give an example of use of aggregation to achieve minimax adaptation over anisotropic Besov spaces, which was not previously known in minimax theory (in regression on a random design)."

1304.7717v2	We introduce the Randomized Dependence Coefficient (RDC), a measure of non-linear dependence between random variables of arbitrary dimension based on the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi Maximum Correlation Coefficient. RDC is defined in terms of correlation of random non-linear copula projections; it is invariant with respect to marginal distribution transformations, has low computational cost and is easy to implement: just five lines of R code, included at the end of the paper.	The Randomized Dependence Coefficient
1301.2724v2	Expectation Propagation (EP) provides a framework for approximate inference. When the model under consideration is over a latent Gaussian field, with the approximation being Gaussian, we show how these approximations can systematically be corrected. A perturbative expansion is made of the exact but intractable correction, and can be applied to the model's partition function and other moments of interest. The correction is expressed over the higher-order cumulants which are neglected by EP's local matching of moments. Through the expansion, we see that EP is correct to first order. By considering higher orders, corrections of increasing polynomial complexity can be applied to the approximation. The second order provides a correction in quadratic time, which we apply to an array of Gaussian process and Ising models. The corrections generalize to arbitrarily complex approximating families, which we illustrate on tree-structured Ising model approximations. Furthermore, they provide a polynomial-time assessment of the approximation error. We also provide both theoretical and practical insights on the exactness of the EP solution.	Perturbative Corrections for Approximate Inference in Gaussian Latent  Variable Models
1711.07814v1	The EM algorithm is one of many important tools in the field of statistics. While often used for imputing missing data, its widespread applications include other common statistical tasks, such as clustering. In clustering, the EM algorithm assumes a parametric distribution for the clusters, whose parameters are estimated through a novel iterative procedure that is based on the theory of maximum likelihood. However, one major drawback of the EM algorithm, that renders it impractical especially when working with large datasets, is that it often requires several passes of the data before convergence. In this paper, we introduce a new EM-style algorithm that implements a novel policy for performing partial E-steps. We call the new algorithm the EM-Tau algorithm, which can approximate the traditional EM algorithm with high accuracy but with only a fraction of the running time.	On the EM-Tau algorithm: a new EM-style algorithm with partial E-steps
1310.6319v2	Latent force models (LFM) are principled approaches to incorporating solutions to differential equations within non-parametric inference methods. Unfortunately, the development and application of LFMs can be inhibited by their computational cost, especially when closed-form solutions for the LFM are unavailable, as is the case in many real world problems where these latent forces exhibit periodic behaviour. Given this, we develop a new sparse representation of LFMs which considerably improves their computational efficiency, as well as broadening their applicability, in a principled way, to domains with periodic or near periodic latent forces. Our approach uses a linear basis model to approximate one generative model for each periodic force. We assume that the latent forces are generated from Gaussian process priors and develop a linear basis model which fully expresses these priors. We apply our approach to model the thermal dynamics of domestic buildings and show that it is effective at predicting day-ahead temperatures within the homes. We also apply our approach within queueing theory in which quasi-periodic arrival rates are modelled as latent forces. In both cases, we demonstrate that our approach can be implemented efficiently using state-space methods which encode the linear dynamic systems via LFMs. Further, we show that state estimates obtained using periodic latent force models can reduce the root mean squared error to 17% of that from non-periodic models and 27% of the nearest rival approach which is the resonator model.	Efficient State-Space Inference of Periodic Latent Force Models
1711.02283v2	This paper presents a novel two-step approach for the fundamental problem of learning an optimal map from one distribution to another. First, we learn an optimal transport (OT) plan, which can be thought as a one-to-many map between the two distributions. To that end, we propose a stochastic dual approach of regularized OT, and show empirically that it scales better than a recent related approach when the amount of samples is very large. Second, we estimate a \textit{Monge map} as a deep neural network learned by approximating the barycentric projection of the previously-obtained OT plan. This parameterization allows generalization of the mapping outside the support of the input measure. We prove two theoretical stability results of regularized OT which show that our estimations converge to the OT plan and Monge map between the underlying continuous measures. We showcase our proposed approach on two applications: domain adaptation and generative modeling.	Large-Scale Optimal Transport and Mapping Estimation
1008.5211v1	We sharply characterize the performance of different penalization schemes for the problem of selecting the relevant variables in the multi-task setting. Previous work focuses on the regression problem where conditions on the design matrix complicate the analysis. A clearer and simpler picture emerges by studying the Normal means model. This model, often used in the field of statistics, is a simplified model that provides a laboratory for studying complex procedures.	Union Support Recovery in Multi-task Learning
1508.00085v1	Log-density gradient estimation is a fundamental statistical problem and possesses various practical applications such as clustering and measuring non-Gaussianity. A naive two-step approach of first estimating the density and then taking its log-gradient is unreliable because an accurate density estimate does not necessarily lead to an accurate log-density gradient estimate. To cope with this problem, a method to directly estimate the log-density gradient without density estimation has been explored, and demonstrated to work much better than the two-step method. The objective of this paper is to further improve the performance of this direct method in multi-dimensional cases. Our idea is to regard the problem of log-density gradient estimation in each dimension as a task, and apply regularized multi-task learning to the direct log-density gradient estimator. We experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed multi-task method in log-density gradient estimation and mode-seeking clustering.	Regularized Multi-Task Learning for Multi-Dimensional Log-Density  Gradient Estimation
1607.02011v2	We propose a vector-valued regression problem whose solution is equivalent to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) embedding of the Bayesian posterior distribution. This equivalence provides a new understanding of kernel Bayesian inference. Moreover, the optimization problem induces a new regularization for the posterior embedding estimator, which is faster and has comparable performance to the squared regularization in kernel Bayes' rule. This regularization coincides with a former thresholding approach used in kernel POMDPs whose consistency remains to be established. Our theoretical work solves this open problem and provides consistency analysis in regression settings. Based on our optimizational formulation, we propose a flexible Bayesian posterior regularization framework which for the first time enables us to put regularization at the distribution level. We apply this method to nonparametric state-space filtering tasks with extremely nonlinear dynamics and show performance gains over all other baselines.	Kernel Bayesian Inference with Posterior Regularization
1702.02165v1	In this work a robust clustering algorithm for stationary time series is proposed. The algorithm is based on the use of estimated spectral densities, which are considered as functional data, as the basic characteristic of stationary time series for clustering purposes. A robust algorithm for functional data is then applied to the set of spectral densities. Trimming techniques and restrictions on the scatter within groups reduce the effect of noise in the data and help to prevent the identification of spurious clusters. The procedure is tested in a simulation study, and is also applied to a real data set.	Robust Clustering for Time Series Using Spectral Densities and  Functional Data Analysis
1202.3737v1	"We describe a method that infers whether statistical dependences between two observed variables X and Y are due to a ""direct"" causal link or only due to a connecting causal path that contains an unobserved variable of low complexity, e.g., a binary variable. This problem is motivated by statistical genetics. Given a genetic marker that is correlated with a phenotype of interest, we want to detect whether this marker is causal or it only correlates with a causal one. Our method is based on the analysis of the location of the conditional distributions P(Y|x) in the simplex of all distributions of Y. We report encouraging results on semi-empirical data."	Detecting low-complexity unobserved causes
1202.5695v2	The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a flexible tool for modeling complex data, however there have been significant computational difficulties in using RBMs to model high-dimensional multinomial observations. In natural language processing applications, words are naturally modeled by K-ary discrete distributions, where K is determined by the vocabulary size and can easily be in the hundreds of thousands. The conventional approach to training RBMs on word observations is limited because it requires sampling the states of K-way softmax visible units during block Gibbs updates, an operation that takes time linear in K. In this work, we address this issue by employing a more general class of Markov chain Monte Carlo operators on the visible units, yielding updates with computational complexity independent of K. We demonstrate the success of our approach by training RBMs on hundreds of millions of word n-grams using larger vocabularies than previously feasible and using the learned features to improve performance on chunking and sentiment classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the latter.	Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines on Word Observations
1705.08933v2	Gaussian processes (GPs) are a good choice for function approximation as they are flexible, robust to over-fitting, and provide well-calibrated predictive uncertainty. Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer generalisations of GPs, but inference in these models has proved challenging. Existing approaches to inference in DGP models assume approximate posteriors that force independence between the layers, and do not work well in practice. We present a doubly stochastic variational inference algorithm, which does not force independence between layers. With our method of inference we demonstrate that a DGP model can be used effectively on data ranging in size from hundreds to a billion points. We provide strong empirical evidence that our inference scheme for DGPs works well in practice in both classification and regression.

1705.07321v2	We present an accelerated algorithm for hierarchical density based clustering. Our new algorithm improves upon HDBSCAN*, which itself provided a significant qualitative improvement over the popular DBSCAN algorithm. The accelerated HDBSCAN* algorithm provides comparable performance to DBSCAN, while supporting variable density clusters, and eliminating the need for the difficult to tune distance scale parameter. This makes accelerated HDBSCAN* the default choice for density based clustering. Library available at: this https URL	Accelerated Hierarchical Density Clustering
0908.0572v1	We present a streaming model for large-scale classification (in the context of $\ell_2$-SVM) by leveraging connections between learning and computational geometry. The streaming model imposes the constraint that only a single pass over the data is allowed. The $\ell_2$-SVM is known to have an equivalent formulation in terms of the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem, and an efficient algorithm based on the idea of \emph{core sets} exists (Core Vector Machine, CVM). CVM learns a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate MEB for a set of points and yields an approximate solution to corresponding SVM instance. However CVM works in batch mode requiring multiple passes over the data. This paper presents a single-pass SVM which is based on the minimum enclosing ball of streaming data. We show that the MEB updates for the streaming case can be easily adapted to learn the SVM weight vector in a way similar to using online stochastic gradient updates. Our algorithm performs polylogarithmic computation at each example, and requires very small and constant storage. Experimental results show that, even in such restrictive settings, we can learn efficiently in just one pass and get accuracies comparable to other state-of-the-art SVM solvers (batch and online). We also give an analysis of the algorithm, and discuss some open issues and possible extensions.	Streamed Learning: One-Pass SVMs
1705.00674v2	Consider two networks on overlapping, non-identical vertex sets. Given vertices of interest in the first network, we seek to identify the corresponding vertices, if any exist, in the second network. While in moderately sized networks graph matching methods can be applied directly to recover the missing correspondences, herein we present a principled methodology appropriate for situations in which the networks are too large for brute-force graph matching. Our methodology identifies vertices in a local neighborhood of the vertices of interest in the first network that have verifiable corresponding vertices in the second network. Leveraging these known correspondences, referred to as seeds, we match the induced subgraphs in each network generated by the neighborhoods of these verified seeds, and rank the vertices of the second network in terms of the most likely matches to the original vertices of interest. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology through simulations and real data examples.	Vertex Nomination Via Local Neighborhood Matching
1710.08952v1	In this paper we present a technique for using the bootstrap to estimate the operating characteristics and their variability for certain types of ensemble methods. Bootstrapping a model can require a huge amount of work if the training data set is large. Fortunately in many cases the technique lets us determine the effect of infinite resampling without actually refitting a single model. We apply the technique to the study of meta-parameter selection for random forests. We demonstrate that alternatives to bootstrap aggregation and to considering \sqrt{d} features to split each node, where d is the number of features, can produce improvements in predictive accuracy.	Estimating the Operating Characteristics of Ensemble Methods
1205.6210v2	Sparse coding in learned dictionaries has been established as a successful approach for signal denoising, source separation and solving inverse problems in general. A dictionary learning method adapts an initial dictionary to a particular signal class by iteratively computing an approximate factorization of a training data matrix into a dictionary and a sparse coding matrix. The learned dictionary is characterized by two properties: the coherence of the dictionary to observations of the signal class, and the self-coherence of the dictionary atoms. A high coherence to the signal class enables the sparse coding of signal observations with a small approximation error, while a low self-coherence of the atoms guarantees atom recovery and a more rapid residual error decay rate for the sparse coding algorithm. The two goals of high signal coherence and low self-coherence are typically in conflict, therefore one seeks a trade-off between them, depending on the application. We present a dictionary learning method with an effective control over the self-coherence of the trained dictionary, enabling a trade-off between maximizing the sparsity of codings and approximating an equiangular tight frame.	Learning Dictionaries with Bounded Self-Coherence
0802.0964v2	Least Angle Regression is a promising technique for variable selection applications, offering a nice alternative to stepwise regression. It provides an explanation for the similar behavior of LASSO ($\ell_1$-penalized regression) and forward stagewise regression, and provides a fast implementation of both. The idea has caught on rapidly, and sparked a great deal of research interest. In this paper, we give an overview of Least Angle Regression and the current state of related research.

0810.4553v1	We present a new online boosting algorithm for adapting the weights of a boosted classifier, which yields a closer approximation to Freund and Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm than previous online boosting algorithms. We also contribute a new way of deriving the online algorithm that ties together previous online boosting work. We assume that the weak hypotheses were selected beforehand, and only their weights are updated during online boosting. The update rule is derived by minimizing AdaBoost's loss when viewed in an incremental form. The equations show that optimization is computationally expensive. However, a fast online approximation is possible. We compare approximation error to batch AdaBoost on synthetic datasets and generalization error on face datasets and the MNIST dataset.

1710.03627v1	In this paper, we propose a framework for automatic classification of patients from multimodal genetic and brain imaging data by optimally combining them. Additive models with unadapted penalties (such as the classical group lasso penalty or $L_1$-multiple kernel learning) treat all modalities in the same manner and can result in undesirable elimination of specific modalities when their contributions are unbalanced. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multilevel model that combines imaging and genetics and that considers joint effects between these two modalities for diagnosis prediction. Furthermore, we propose a framework allowing to combine several penalties taking into account the structure of the different types of data, such as a group lasso penalty over the genetic modality and a $L_2$-penalty on imaging modalities. Finally , we propose a fast optimization algorithm, based on a proximal gradient method. The model has been evaluated on genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms-SNP) and imaging (anatomical MRI measures) data from the ADNI database, and compared to additive models. It exhibits good performances in AD diagnosis; and at the same time, reveals relationships between genes, brain regions and the disease status.

1509.06831v1	Given i.i.d samples from some unknown continuous density on hyper-rectangle $[0, 1]^d$, we attempt to learn a piecewise constant function that approximates this underlying density non-parametrically. Our density estimate is defined on a binary split of $[0, 1]^d$ and built up sequentially according to discrepancy criteria; the key ingredient is to control the discrepancy adaptively in each sub-rectangle to achieve overall bound. We prove that the estimate, even though simple as it appears, preserves most of the estimation power. By exploiting its structure, it can be directly applied to some important pattern recognition tasks such as mode seeking and density landscape exploration. We demonstrate its applicability through simulations and examples.	Density Estimation via Discrepancy
1205.4770v1	We consider the high-dimensional heteroscedastic regression model, where the mean and the log variance are modeled as a linear combination of input variables. Existing literature on high-dimensional linear regres- sion models has largely ignored non-constant error variances, even though they commonly occur in a variety of applications ranging from biostatis- tics to finance. In this paper we study a class of non-convex penalized pseudolikelihood estimators for both the mean and variance parameters. We show that the Heteroscedastic Iterative Penalized Pseudolikelihood Optimizer (HIPPO) achieves the oracle property, that is, we prove that the rates of convergence are the same as if the true model was known. We demonstrate numerical properties of the procedure on a simulation study and real world data.	Variance function estimation in high-dimensions
1106.3651v2	In the Bayesian approach to sequential decision making, exact calculation of the (subjective) utility is intractable. This extends to most special cases of interest, such as reinforcement learning problems. While utility bounds are known to exist for this problem, so far none of them were particularly tight. In this paper, we show how to efficiently calculate a lower bound, which corresponds to the utility of a near-optimal memoryless policy for the decision problem, which is generally different from both the Bayes-optimal policy and the policy which is optimal for the expected MDP under the current belief. We then show how these can be applied to obtain robust exploration policies in a Bayesian reinforcement learning setting.	Robust Bayesian reinforcement learning through tight lower bounds
1605.03122v1	Structural equation models (SEMs) have been widely adopted for inference of causal interactions in complex networks. Recent examples include unveiling topologies of hidden causal networks over which processes such as spreading diseases, or rumors propagate. The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from their simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear dependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent to adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which account for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The advocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for nonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put forth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a convex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to proximal-splitting optimization methods. To this end, solvers with complementary merits are developed by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers, and proximal gradient iterations. Experiments conducted on simulated data demonstrate that the novel approach outperforms linear SEMs with respect to edge detection errors. Furthermore, tests on a real gene expression dataset unveil interesting new edges that were not revealed by linear SEMs, which could shed more light on regulatory behavior of human genes.

1710.10919v1	The state-of-the-art algorithm known as kernel-based dynamic mode decomposition (K-DMD) provides a sub-optimal solution to the problem of reduced modeling of a dynamical system based on a finite approximation of the Koopman operator. It relies on crude approximations and on restrictive assumptions. The purpose of this work is to propose a kernel-based algorithm solving exactly this low-rank approximation problem in a general setting.	Optimal Kernel-Based Dynamic Mode Decomposition
1211.0932v1	We study the mixtures of factorizing probability distributions represented as visible marginal distributions in stochastic layered networks. We take the perspective of kernel transitions of distributions, which gives a unified picture of distributed representations arising from Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and other networks without lateral connections. We describe combinatorial and geometric properties of the set of kernels and products of kernels realizable by DBNs as the network parameters vary. We describe explicit classes of probability distributions, including exponential families, that can be learned by DBNs. We use these submodels to bound the maximal and the expected Kullback-Leibler approximation errors of DBNs from above depending on the number of hidden layers and units that they contain.	Kernels and Submodels of Deep Belief Networks
1705.07178v2	Inference of latent feature models in the Bayesian nonparametric setting is generally difficult, especially in high dimensional settings, because it usually requires proposing features from some prior distribution. In special cases, where the integration is tractable, we could sample feature assignments according to a predictive likelihood. However, this still may not be efficient in high dimensions. We present a novel method to accelerate the mixing of latent variable model inference by proposing feature locations from the data, as opposed to the prior. This sampling method is efficient for proper mixing of the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, computationally attractive because this method can be performed in parallel, and is theoretically guaranteed to converge to the posterior distribution as its limiting distribution.

1502.07104v1	We present a derivation of the Kullback Leibler (KL)-Divergence (also known as Relative Entropy) for the von Mises Fisher (VMF) Distribution in $d$-dimensions.	A Note on the Kullback-Leibler Divergence for the von Mises-Fisher  distribution
1708.00253v1	Quick and accurate medical diagnosis is crucial for the successful treatment of a disease. Using machine learning algorithms, we have built two models to predict a hematologic disease, based on laboratory blood test results. In one predictive model, we used all available blood test parameters and in the other a reduced set, which is usually measured upon patient admittance. Both models produced good results, with a prediction accuracy of 0.88 and 0.86, when considering the list of five most probable diseases, and 0.59 and 0.57, when considering only the most probable disease. Models did not differ significantly from each other, which indicates that a reduced set of parameters contains a relevant fingerprint of a disease, expanding the utility of the model for general practitioner's use and indicating that there is more information in the blood test results than physicians recognize. In the clinical test we showed that the accuracy of our predictive models was on a par with the ability of hematology specialists. Our study is the first to show that a machine learning predictive model based on blood tests alone, can be successfully applied to predict hematologic diseases and could open up unprecedented possibilities in medical diagnosis.	Application of machine learning for hematological diagnosis
0909.0934v1	In a Gaussian graphical model, the conditional independence between two variables are characterized by the corresponding zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix. Maximum likelihood method using the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty (Fan and Li, 2001) and the adaptive LASSO penalty (Zou, 2006) have been proposed in literature. In this article, we establish the result that using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to select the tuning parameter in penalized likelihood estimation with both types of penalties can lead to consistent graphical model selection. We compare the empirical performance of BIC with cross validation method and demonstrate the advantageous performance of BIC criterion for tuning parameter selection through simulation studies.

1205.2609v1	Recent theory work has found that a special type of spatial partition tree - called a random projection tree - is adaptive to the intrinsic dimension of the data from which it is built. Here we examine this same question, with a combination of theory and experiments, for a broader class of trees that includes k-d trees, dyadic trees, and PCA trees. Our motivation is to get a feel for (i) the kind of intrinsic low dimensional structure that can be empirically verified, (ii) the extent to which a spatial partition can exploit such structure, and (iii) the implications for standard statistical tasks such as regression, vector quantization, and nearest neighbor search.	Which Spatial Partition Trees are Adaptive to Intrinsic Dimension?
1710.09443v2	We introduce the Givens Transform, a novel transform between the space of orthonormal matrices and $\mathbb{R}^D$. The Givens Transform allows for the application of any general Bayesian inference algorithm to probabilistic models containing constrained unit-vectors or orthonormal matrix parameters. This includes a variety of matrix factorizations and dimensionality reduction models such as Probabilistic PCA (PPCA), Exponential Family PPCA (BXPCA), and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). While previous Bayesian approaches to these models relied on separate sampling update rules for constrained and unconstrained parameters, the Givens Transform enables the treatment of unit-vectors and orthonormal matrices agnostically as unconstrained parameters. Thus any Bayesian inference algorithm can be used on these models without modification. This opens the door to not just sampling algorithms, but Variational Inference (VI) as well. We illustrate with several examples and supplied code, how the Givens Transform allows end-users to easily build complex models in their favorite Bayesian modeling framework such as Stan, Edward, or PyMC3, a task that was previously intractable due to technical constraints.	General Bayesian Inference over the Stiefel Manifold via the Givens  Transform
1204.3523v1	In distributed learning, the goal is to perform a learning task over data distributed across multiple nodes with minimal (expensive) communication. Prior work (Daume III et al., 2012) proposes a general model that bounds the communication required for learning classifiers while allowing for $\eps$ training error on linearly separable data adversarially distributed across nodes. In this work, we develop key improvements and extensions to this basic model. Our first result is a two-party multiplicative-weight-update based protocol that uses $O(d^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of communication to classify distributed data in arbitrary dimension $d$, $\eps$-optimally. This readily extends to classification over $k$ nodes with $O(kd^2 \log{1/\eps})$ words of communication. Our proposed protocol is simple to implement and is considerably more efficient than baselines compared, as demonstrated by our empirical results. In addition, we illustrate general algorithm design paradigms for doing efficient learning over distributed data. We show how to solve fixed-dimensional and high dimensional linear programming efficiently in a distributed setting where constraints may be distributed across nodes. Since many learning problems can be viewed as convex optimization problems where constraints are generated by individual points, this models many typical distributed learning scenarios. Our techniques make use of a novel connection from multipass streaming, as well as adapting the multiplicative-weight-update framework more generally to a distributed setting. As a consequence, our methods extend to the wide range of problems solvable using these techniques.	Efficient Protocols for Distributed Classification and Optimization
1602.01345v2	"Hearing Aid (HA) algorithms need to be tuned (""fitted"") to match the impairment of each specific patient. The lack of a fundamental HA fitting theory is a strong contributing factor to an unsatisfying sound experience for about 20% of hearing aid patients. This paper proposes a probabilistic modeling approach to the design of HA algorithms. The proposed method relies on a generative probabilistic model for the hearing loss problem and provides for automated inference of the corresponding (1) signal processing algorithm, (2) the fitting solution as well as a principled (3) performance evaluation metric. All three tasks are realized as message passing algorithms in a factor graph representation of the generative model, which in principle allows for fast implementation on hearing aid or mobile device hardware. The methods are theoretically worked out and simulated with a custom-built factor graph toolbox for a specific hearing loss model."	A Probabilistic Modeling Approach to Hearing Loss Compensation
1104.1992v1	Many real-world problems encountered in several disciplines deal with the modeling of time-series containing different underlying dynamical regimes, for which probabilistic approaches are very often employed. In this paper we describe several such approaches in the common framework of graphical models. We give a unified overview of models previously introduced in the literature, which is simpler and more comprehensive than previous descriptions and enables us to highlight commonalities and differences among models that were not observed in the past. In addition, we present several new models and inference routines, which are naturally derived within this unified viewpoint.	Unified Treatment of Hidden Markov Switching Models
1710.07006v1	The inverse covariance matrix provides considerable insight for understanding statistical models in the multivariate setting. In particular, when the distribution over variables is assumed to be multivariate normal, the sparsity pattern in the inverse covariance matrix, commonly referred to as the precision matrix, corresponds to the adjacency matrix representation of the Gauss-Markov graph, which encodes conditional independence statements between variables. Minimax results under the spectral norm have previously been established for covariance matrices, both sparse and banded, and for sparse precision matrices. We establish minimax estimation bounds for estimating banded precision matrices under the spectral norm. Our results greatly improve upon the existing bounds; in particular, we find that the minimax rate for estimating banded precision matrices matches that of estimating banded covariance matrices. The key insight in our analysis is that we are able to obtain barely-noisy estimates of $k \times k$ subblocks of the precision matrix by inverting slightly wider blocks of the empirical covariance matrix along the diagonal. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments demonstrating the sharpness of our bounds.	Minimax Estimation of Bandable Precision Matrices
1610.07216v2	In this paper, we develop a new sequential regression modeling approach for data streams. Data streams are commonly found around us, e.g in a retail enterprise sales data is continuously collected every day. A demand forecasting model is an important outcome from the data that needs to be continuously updated with the new incoming data. The main challenge in such modeling arises when there is a) high dimensional and sparsity, b) need for an adaptive use of prior knowledge, and/or c) structural changes in the system. The proposed approach addresses these challenges by incorporating an adaptive L1-penalty and inertia terms in the loss function, and thus called Inertial Regularization and Selection (IRS). The former term performs model selection to handle the first challenge while the latter is shown to address the last two challenges. A recursive estimation algorithm is developed, and shown to outperform the commonly used state-space models, such as Kalman Filters, in experimental studies and real data.

1703.09112v1	In real-time monitoring of hospital patients, high-quality inference of patients' health status using all information available from clinical covariates and lab tests are essential to enable successful medical interventions and improve patient outcomes. In this work, we develop and explore a Bayesian nonparametric model based on Gaussian process (GP) regression for hospital patient monitoring. Our method, MedGP, incorporates 24 clinical and lab covariates and supports a rich reference data set from which the relationships between these observed covariates may be inferred and exploited for high-quality inference of patient state over time. To do this, we develop a highly structured sparse GP kernel to enable tractable computation over tens of thousands of time points while estimating correlations among clinical covariates, patients, and periodicity in high-dimensional time series measurements of physiological signals. We apply MedGP to data from hundreds of thousands of patients treated at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. MedGP has a number of benefits over current methods, including (i) not requiring an alignment of the time series data, (ii) quantifying confidence intervals in the predictions, (iii) exploiting a vast and rich database of patients, and (iv) providing interpretable relationships among clinical covariates. We evaluate and compare results from MedGP on the task of online state prediction for three different patient subgroups.	Sparse Multi-Output Gaussian Processes for Medical Time Series  Prediction
0908.0570v1	We propose a nonparametric Bayesian factor regression model that accounts for uncertainty in the number of factors, and the relationship between factors. To accomplish this, we propose a sparse variant of the Indian Buffet Process and couple this with a hierarchical model over factors, based on Kingman's coalescent. We apply this model to two problems (factor analysis and factor regression) in gene-expression data analysis.	The Infinite Hierarchical Factor Regression Model
1206.1846v2	A mixture of Gaussians fit to a single curved or heavy-tailed cluster will report that the data contains many clusters. To produce more appropriate clusterings, we introduce a model which warps a latent mixture of Gaussians to produce nonparametric cluster shapes. The possibly low-dimensional latent mixture model allows us to summarize the properties of the high-dimensional clusters (or density manifolds) describing the data. The number of manifolds, as well as the shape and dimension of each manifold is automatically inferred. We derive a simple inference scheme for this model which analytically integrates out both the mixture parameters and the warping function. We show that our model is effective for density estimation, performs better than infinite Gaussian mixture models at recovering the true number of clusters, and produces interpretable summaries of high-dimensional datasets.	Warped Mixtures for Nonparametric Cluster Shapes
1505.03511v1	A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how activity in the nervous system is related to features of the external world, or to features of the nervous system itself. A common approach is to model neural responses as a weighted combination of external features, or vice versa. The structure of the model weights can provide insight into neural representations. Often, neural input-output relationships are sparse, with only a few inputs contributing to the output. In part to account for such sparsity, structured regularizers are incorporated into model fitting optimization. However, by imposing priors, structured regularizers can make it difficult to interpret learned model parameters. Here, we investigate a simple, minimally structured model estimation method for accurate, unbiased estimation of sparse models based on Bootstrapped Adaptive Threshold Selection followed by ordinary least-squares refitting (BoATS). Through extensive numerical investigations, we show that this method often performs favorably compared to L1 and L2 regularizers. In particular, for a variety of model distributions and noise levels, BoATS more accurately recovers the parameters of sparse models, leading to more parsimonious explanations of outputs. Finally, we apply this method to the task of decoding human speech production from ECoG recordings.	Bootstrapped Adaptive Threshold Selection for Statistical Model  Selection and Estimation
1710.10768v1	We consider classifiers for high-dimensional data under the strongly spiked eigenvalue (SSE) model. We first show that high-dimensional data often have the SSE model. We consider a distance-based classifier using eigenstructures for the SSE model. We apply the noise reduction methodology to estimation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the SSE model. We create a new distance-based classifier by transforming data from the SSE model to the non-SSE model. We give simulation studies and discuss the performance of the new classifier. Finally, we demonstrate the new classifier by using microarray data sets.	Distance-based classifier by data transformation for high-dimension,  strongly spiked eigenvalue models
1202.3770v1	Due to myriads of classes, designing accurate and efficient classifiers becomes very challenging for multi-class classification. Recent research has shown that class structure learning can greatly facilitate multi-class learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method to learn the class structure for multi-class classification problems. The class structure is assumed to be a binary hierarchical tree. To learn such a tree, we propose a maximum separating margin method to determine the child nodes of any internal node. The proposed method ensures that two classgroups represented by any two sibling nodes are most separable. In the experiments, we evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method over other multi-class classification methods on real world large-scale problems. The results show that the proposed method outperforms benchmark methods in terms of accuracy for most datasets and performs comparably with other class structure learning methods in terms of efficiency for all datasets.	Hierarchical Maximum Margin Learning for Multi-Class Classification
0911.4397v1	Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a method for extracting slowly varying driving forces from quickly varying nonstationary time series. We show here that it is possible for SFA to detect a component which is even slower than the driving force itself (e.g. the envelope of a modulated sine wave). It is shown that it depends on circumstances like the embedding dimension, the time series predictability, or the base frequency, whether the driving force itself or a slower subcomponent is detected. We observe a phase transition from one regime to the other and it is the purpose of this work to quantify the influence of various parameters on this phase transition. We conclude that what is percieved as slow by SFA varies and that a more or less fast switching from one regime to the other occurs, perhaps showing some similarity to human perception.	How slow is slow? SFA detects signals that are slower than the driving  force
1610.05247v1	Importance sampling is widely used in machine learning and statistics, but its power is limited by the restriction of using simple proposals for which the importance weights can be tractably calculated. We address this problem by studying black-box importance sampling methods that calculate importance weights for samples generated from any unknown proposal or black-box mechanism. Our method allows us to use better and richer proposals to solve difficult problems, and (somewhat counter-intuitively) also has the additional benefit of improving the estimation accuracy beyond typical importance sampling. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are provided.	Black-box Importance Sampling
1710.10301v1	This work presents a new classifier that is specifically designed to be fully interpretable. This technique determines the probability of a class outcome, based directly on probability assignments measured from the training data. The accuracy of the predicted probability can be improved by measuring more probability estimates from the training data to create a series expansion that refines the predicted probability. We use this work to classify four standard datasets and achieve accuracies comparable to that of Random Forests. Because this technique is interpretable by design, it is capable of determining the combinations of features that contribute to a particular classification probability for individual cases as well as the weightings of each of combination of features.	Probability Series Expansion Classifier that is Interpretable by Design
1202.3735v1	Given a set of experiments in which varying subsets of observed variables are subject to intervention, we consider the problem of identifiability of causal models exhibiting latent confounding. While identifiability is trivial when each experiment intervenes on a large number of variables, the situation is more complicated when only one or a few variables are subject to intervention per experiment. For linear causal models with latent variables Hyttinen et al. (2010) gave precise conditions for when such data are sufficient to identify the full model. While their result cannot be extended to discrete-valued variables with arbitrary cause-effect relationships, we show that a similar result can be obtained for the class of causal models whose conditional probability distributions are restricted to a `noisy-OR' parameterization. We further show that identification is preserved under an extension of the model that allows for negative influences, and present learning algorithms that we test for accuracy, scalability and robustness.	Noisy-OR Models with Latent Confounding
1101.5919v1	Unsupervised two-view learning, or detection of dependencies between two paired data sets, is typically done by some variant of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA searches for a linear projection for each view, such that the correlations between the projections are maximized. The solution is invariant to any linear transformation of either or both of the views; for tasks with small sample size such flexibility implies overfitting, which is even worse for more flexible nonparametric or kernel-based dependency discovery methods. We develop variants which reduce the degrees of freedom by assuming constraints on similarity of the projections in the two views. A particular example is provided by a cancer gene discovery application where chromosomal distance affects the dependencies between gene copy number and activity levels. Similarity constraints are shown to improve detection performance of known cancer genes.	Dependency detection with similarity constraints
1203.4354v1	Regularized kernel methods such as, e.g., support vector machines and least-squares support vector regression constitute an important class of standard learning algorithms in machine learning. Theoretical investigations concerning asymptotic properties have manly focused on rates of convergence during the last years but there are only very few and limited (asymptotic) results on statistical inference so far. As this is a serious limitation for their use in mathematical statistics, the goal of the article is to fill this gap. Based on asymptotic normality of many of these methods, the article derives a strongly consistent estimator for the unknown covariance matrix of the limiting normal distribution. In this way, we obtain asymptotically correct confidence sets for $\psi(f_{P,\lambda_0})$ where $f_{P,\lambda_0}$ denotes the minimizer of the regularized risk in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ and $\psi:H\rightarrow\mathds{R}^m$ is any Hadamard-differentiable functional. Applications include (multivariate) pointwise confidence sets for values of $f_{P,\lambda_0}$ and confidence sets for gradients, integrals, and norms.	Asymptotic Confidence Sets for General Nonparametric Regression and  Classification by Regularized Kernel Methods
1402.4078v2	We consider the problem of dictionary learning under the assumption that the observed signals can be represented as sparse linear combinations of the columns of a single large dictionary matrix. In particular, we analyze the minimax risk of the dictionary learning problem which governs the mean squared error (MSE) performance of any learning scheme, regardless of its computational complexity. By following an established information-theoretic method based on Fanos inequality, we derive a lower bound on the minimax risk for a given dictionary learning problem. This lower bound yields a characterization of the sample-complexity, i.e., a lower bound on the required number of observations such that consistent dictionary learning schemes exist. Our bounds may be compared with the performance of a given learning scheme, allowing to characterize how far the method is from optimal performance.	Performance Limits of Dictionary Learning for Sparse Coding
1605.08301v2	We propose a data-driven, coarse-graining formulation in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast to existing techniques which are based on a fine-to-coarse map, we adopt the opposite strategy by prescribing a probabilistic coarse-to-fine map. This corresponds to a directed probabilistic model where the coarse variables play the role of latent generators of the fine scale (all-atom) data. From an information-theoretic perspective, the framework proposed provides an improvement upon the relative entropy method and is capable of quantifying the uncertainty due to the information loss that unavoidably takes place during the CG process. Furthermore, it can be readily extended to a fully Bayesian model where various sources of uncertainties are reflected in the posterior of the model parameters. The latter can be used to produce not only point estimates of fine-scale reconstructions or macroscopic observables, but more importantly, predictive posterior distributions on these quantities. Predictive posterior distributions reflect the confidence of the model as a function of the amount of data and the level of coarse-graining. The issues of model complexity and model selection are seamlessly addressed by employing a hierarchical prior that favors the discovery of sparse solutions, revealing the most prominent features in the coarse-grained model. A flexible and parallelizable Monte Carlo - Expectation-Maximization (MC-EM) scheme is proposed for carrying out inference and learning tasks. A comparative assessment of the proposed methodology is presented for a lattice spin system and the SPC/E water model.	Predictive Coarse-Graining
1505.04363v2	We study the theoretical properties of learning a dictionary from $N$ signals $\mathbf x_i\in \mathbb R^K$ for $i=1,...,N$ via $l_1$-minimization. We assume that $\mathbf x_i$'s are $i.i.d.$ random linear combinations of the $K$ columns from a complete (i.e., square and invertible) reference dictionary $\mathbf D_0 \in \mathbb R^{K\times K}$. Here, the random linear coefficients are generated from either the $s$-sparse Gaussian model or the Bernoulli-Gaussian model. First, for the population case, we establish a sufficient and almost necessary condition for the reference dictionary $\mathbf D_0$ to be locally identifiable, i.e., a local minimum of the expected $l_1$-norm objective function. Our condition covers both sparse and dense cases of the random linear coefficients and significantly improves the sufficient condition by Gribonval and Schnass (2010). In addition, we show that for a complete $\mu$-coherent reference dictionary, i.e., a dictionary with absolute pairwise column inner-product at most $\mu\in[0,1)$, local identifiability holds even when the random linear coefficient vector has up to $O(\mu^{-2})$ nonzeros on average. Moreover, our local identifiability results also translate to the finite sample case with high probability provided that the number of signals $N$ scales as $O(K\log K)$.

1309.5701v2	We present a numerical algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problems under noisy separability. An NMF problem under separability can be stated as one of finding all vertices of the convex hull of data points. The research interest of this paper is to find the vectors as close to the vertices as possible in a situation in which noise is added to the data points. Our algorithm is designed to capture the shape of the convex hull of data points by using its enclosing ellipsoid. We show that the algorithm has correctness and robustness properties from theoretical and practical perspectives; correctness here means that if the data points do not contain any noise, the algorithm can find the vertices of their convex hull; robustness means that if the data points contain noise, the algorithm can find the near-vertices. Finally, we apply the algorithm to document clustering, and report the experimental results.	Ellipsoidal Rounding for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Under Noisy  Separability
1802.07182v2	Multi-output regression models must exploit dependencies between outputs to maximise predictive performance. The application of Gaussian processes (GPs) to this setting typically yields models that are computationally demanding and have limited representational power. We present the Gaussian Process Autoregressive Regression (GPAR) model, a scalable multi-output GP model that is able to capture nonlinear, possibly input-varying, dependencies between outputs in a simple and tractable way: the product rule is used to decompose the joint distribution over the outputs into a set of conditionals, each of which is modelled by a standard GP. GPAR's efficacy is demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real-world problems, outperforming existing GP models and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the tasks with existing benchmarks.

1703.03503v2	We show that DBSCAN can estimate the connected components of the $\lambda$-density level set $\{ x : f(x) \ge \lambda\}$ given $n$ i.i.d. samples from an unknown density $f$. We characterize the regularity of the level set boundaries using parameter $\beta > 0$ and analyze the estimation error under the Hausdorff metric. When the data lies in $\mathbb{R}^D$ we obtain a rate of $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\beta + D)})$, which matches known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. When the data lies on an embedded unknown $d$-dimensional manifold in $\mathbb{R}^D$, then we obtain a rate of $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/(2\beta + d\cdot \max\{1, \beta \})})$. Finally, we provide adaptive parameter tuning in order to attain these rates with no a priori knowledge of the intrinsic dimension, density, or $\beta$.

1603.08708v1	In this paper, we present a unified analysis of matrix completion under general low-dimensional structural constraints induced by {\em any} norm regularization. We consider two estimators for the general problem of structured matrix completion, and provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and the estimation error. Our analysis relies on results from generic chaining, and we establish two intermediate results of independent interest: (a) in characterizing the size or complexity of low dimensional subsets in high dimensional ambient space, a certain partial complexity measure encountered in the analysis of matrix completion problems is characterized in terms of a well understood complexity measure of Gaussian widths, and (b) it is shown that a form of restricted strong convexity holds for matrix completion problems under general norm regularization. Further, we provide several non-trivial examples of structures included in our framework, notably the recently proposed spectral $k$-support norm.

1511.06772v1	"In some speaker recognition scenarios we find conversations recorded simultaneously over multiple channels. That is the case of the interviews in the NIST SRE dataset. To take advantage of that, we propose a modification of the PLDA model that considers two different inter-session variability terms. The first term is tied between all the recordings belonging to the same conversation whereas the second is not. Thus, the former mainly intends to capture the variability due to the phonetic content of the conversation while the latter tries to capture the channel variability. In this document, we derive the equations for this model. This model was applied in the paper ""Handling Recordings Acquired Simultaneously over Multiple Channels with PLDA"" published at Interspeech 2013."	PLDA with Two Sources of Inter-session Variability
1511.07944v1	"We derive a statistical model for estimation of a dendrogram from single linkage hierarchical clustering (SLHC) that takes account of uncertainty through noise or corruption in the measurements of separation of data. Our focus is on just the estimation of the hierarchy of partitions afforded by the dendrogram, rather than the heights in the latter. The concept of estimating this ""dendrogram structure'' is introduced, and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the dendrogram structure is described. These ideas are illustrated by a simple Monte Carlo simulation that, at least for small data sets, suggests the method outperforms SLHC in the presence of noise."

1707.02476v1	"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have excellent representative power and are state of the art classifiers on many tasks. However, they often do not capture their own uncertainties well making them less robust in the real world as they overconfidently extrapolate and do not notice domain shift. Gaussian processes (GPs) with RBF kernels on the other hand have better calibrated uncertainties and do not overconfidently extrapolate far from data in their training set. However, GPs have poor representational power and do not perform as well as DNNs on complex domains. In this paper we show that GP hybrid deep networks, GPDNNs, (GPs on top of DNNs and trained end-to-end) inherit the nice properties of both GPs and DNNs and are much more robust to adversarial examples. When extrapolating to adversarial examples and testing in domain shift settings, GPDNNs frequently output high entropy class probabilities corresponding to essentially ""don't know"". GPDNNs are therefore promising as deep architectures that know when they don't know."	Adversarial Examples, Uncertainty, and Transfer Testing Robustness in  Gaussian Process Hybrid Deep Networks
0811.2177v3	Assigning significance in high-dimensional regression is challenging. Most computationally efficient selection algorithms cannot guard against inclusion of noise variables. Asymptotically valid p-values are not available. An exception is a recent proposal by Wasserman and Roeder (2008) which splits the data into two parts. The number of variables is then reduced to a manageable size using the first split, while classical variable selection techniques can be applied to the remaining variables, using the data from the second split. This yields asymptotic error control under minimal conditions. It involves, however, a one-time random split of the data. Results are sensitive to this arbitrary choice: it amounts to a `p-value lottery' and makes it difficult to reproduce results. Here, we show that inference across multiple random splits can be aggregated, while keeping asymptotic control over the inclusion of noise variables. We show that the resulting p-values can be used for control of both family-wise error (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR). In addition, the proposed aggregation is shown to improve power while reducing the number of falsely selected variables substantially.	P-values for high-dimensional regression
1801.08273v1	In this paper, we design a nonparametric online algorithm for estimating the triggering functions of multivariate Hawkes processes. Unlike parametric estimation, where evolutionary dynamics can be exploited for fast computation of the gradient, and unlike typical function learning, where representer theorem is readily applicable upon proper regularization of the objective function, nonparametric estimation faces the challenges of (i) inefficient evaluation of the gradient, (ii) lack of representer theorem, and (iii) computationally expensive projection necessary to guarantee positivity of the triggering functions. In this paper, we offer solutions to the above challenges, and design an online estimation algorithm named NPOLE-MHP that outputs estimations with a $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ regret, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ stability. Furthermore, we design an algorithm, NPOLE-MMHP, for estimation of multivariate marked Hawkes processes. We test the performance of NPOLE-MHP on various synthetic and real datasets, and demonstrate, under different evaluation metrics, that NPOLE-MHP performs as good as the optimal maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), while having a run time as little as parametric online algorithms.

1608.07986v2	Manifold Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been introduced to sample more effectively from challenging target densities exhibiting multiple modes or strong correlations. Such algorithms exploit the local geometry of the parameter space, thus enabling chains to achieve a faster convergence rate when measured in number of steps. However, often acquiring local geometric information increases computational complexity per step to the extent that sampling from high-dimensional targets becomes inefficient in terms of total computational time. This paper analyzes the computational complexity of manifold Langevin Monte Carlo and proposes a manifold adaptive Monte Carlo sampler aimed at balancing the benefits of exploiting local geometry with computational requirements to achieve a high effective sample size for a given computational cost. The suggested strategy randomly switches between a local geometric and an adaptive proposal kernel via a schedule to regulate the frequency of manifold-based updates. An exponentially decaying schedule is put forward that enables more frequent updates of geometric information in early transient phases of the chain, while saving computational time in late stationary phases. The average complexity can be manually set depending on the need for geometric exploitation posed by the underlying model.	On the Computational Complexity of Geometric Langevin Monte Carlo
1104.1990v3	In many practical applications of clustering, the objects to be clustered evolve over time, and a clustering result is desired at each time step. In such applications, evolutionary clustering typically outperforms traditional static clustering by producing clustering results that reflect long-term trends while being robust to short-term variations. Several evolutionary clustering algorithms have recently been proposed, often by adding a temporal smoothness penalty to the cost function of a static clustering method. In this paper, we introduce a different approach to evolutionary clustering by accurately tracking the time-varying proximities between objects followed by static clustering. We present an evolutionary clustering framework that adaptively estimates the optimal smoothing parameter using shrinkage estimation, a statistical approach that improves a naive estimate using additional information. The proposed framework can be used to extend a variety of static clustering algorithms, including hierarchical, k-means, and spectral clustering, into evolutionary clustering algorithms. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets indicate that the proposed framework outperforms static clustering and existing evolutionary clustering algorithms in many scenarios.

1205.4591v3	I introduce Forecastable Component Analysis (ForeCA), a novel dimension reduction technique for temporally dependent signals. Based on a new forecastability measure, ForeCA finds an optimal transformation to separate a multivariate time series into a forecastable and an orthogonal white noise space. I present a converging algorithm with a fast eigenvector solution. Applications to financial and macro-economic time series show that ForeCA can successfully discover informative structure, which can be used for forecasting as well as classification. The R package ForeCA (this http URL) accompanies this work and is publicly available on CRAN.	Forecastable Component Analysis (ForeCA)
1603.07394v1	Patent lawsuits are costly and time-consuming. An ability to forecast a patent litigation and time to litigation allows companies to better allocate budget and time in managing their patent portfolios. We develop predictive models for estimating the likelihood of litigation for patents and the expected time to litigation based on both textual and non-textual features. Our work focuses on improving the state-of-the-art by relying on a different set of features and employing more sophisticated algorithms with more realistic data. The rate of patent litigations is very low, which consequently makes the problem difficult. The initial model for predicting the likelihood is further modified to capture a time-to-litigation perspective.	Predicting litigation likelihood and time to litigation for patents
1309.2895v1	Regularized principal components analysis, especially Sparse PCA and Functional PCA, has become widely used for dimension reduction in high-dimensional settings. Many examples of massive data, however, may benefit from estimating both sparse AND functional factors. These include neuroimaging data where there are discrete brain regions of activation (sparsity) but these regions tend to be smooth spatially (functional). Here, we introduce an optimization framework that can encourage both sparsity and smoothness of the row and/or column PCA factors. This framework generalizes many of the existing approaches to Sparse PCA, Functional PCA and two-way Sparse PCA and Functional PCA, as these are all special cases of our method. In particular, our method permits flexible combinations of sparsity and smoothness that lead to improvements in feature selection and signal recovery as well as more interpretable PCA factors. We demonstrate our method on simulated data and a neuroimaging example on EEG data. This work provides a unified framework for regularized PCA that can form the foundation for a cohesive approach to regularization in high-dimensional multivariate analysis.

1310.4375v3	We present new algorithms to compute the mean of a set of empirical probability measures under the optimal transport metric. This mean, known as the Wasserstein barycenter, is the measure that minimizes the sum of its Wasserstein distances to each element in that set. We propose two original algorithms to compute Wasserstein barycenters that build upon the subgradient method. A direct implementation of these algorithms is, however, too costly because it would require the repeated resolution of large primal and dual optimal transport problems to compute subgradients. Extending the work of Cuturi (2013), we propose to smooth the Wasserstein distance used in the definition of Wasserstein barycenters with an entropic regularizer and recover in doing so a strictly convex objective whose gradients can be computed for a considerably cheaper computational cost using matrix scaling algorithms. We use these algorithms to visualize a large family of images and to solve a constrained clustering problem.	Fast Computation of Wasserstein Barycenters
1105.4681v3	We generalize stochastic subgradient descent methods to situations in which we do not receive independent samples from the distribution over which we optimize, but instead receive samples that are coupled over time. We show that as long as the source of randomness is suitably ergodic---it converges quickly enough to a stationary distribution---the method enjoys strong convergence guarantees, both in expectation and with high probability. This result has implications for stochastic optimization in high-dimensional spaces, peer-to-peer distributed optimization schemes, decision problems with dependent data, and stochastic optimization problems over combinatorial spaces.

0902.2808v1	We first pursue the study of how hierarchy provides a well-adapted tool for the analysis of change. Then, using a time sequence-constrained hierarchical clustering, we develop the practical aspects of a new approach to wavelet regression. This provides a new way to link hierarchical relationships in a multivariate time series data set with external signals. Violence data from the Colombian conflict in the years 1990 to 2004 is used throughout. We conclude with some proposals for further study on the relationship between social violence and market forces, viz. between the Colombian conflict and the US narcotics market.

1403.4544v3	The Lasso is a computationally efficient regression regularization procedure that can produce sparse estimators when the number of predictors (p) is large. Oracle inequalities provide probability loss bounds for the Lasso estimator at a deterministic choice of the regularization parameter. These bounds tend to zero if p is appropriately controlled, and are thus commonly cited as theoretical justification for the Lasso and its ability to handle high-dimensional settings. Unfortunately, in practice the regularization parameter is not selected to be a deterministic quantity, but is instead chosen using a random, data-dependent procedure. To address this shortcoming of previous theoretical work, we study the loss of the Lasso estimator when tuned optimally for prediction. Assuming orthonormal predictors and a sparse true model, we prove that the probability that the best possible predictive performance of the Lasso deteriorates as p increases is positive and can be arbitrarily close to one given a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio and sufficiently large p. We further demonstrate empirically that the amount of deterioration in performance can be far worse than the oracle inequalities suggest and provide a real data example where deterioration is observed.	On the Sensitivity of the Lasso to the Number of Predictor Variables
1008.2908v1	In the last few years, many different performance measures have been introduced to overcome the weakness of the most natural metric, the Accuracy. Among them, Matthews Correlation Coefficient has recently gained popularity among researchers not only in machine learning but also in several application fields such as bioinformatics. Nonetheless, further novel functions are being proposed in literature. We show that Confusion Entropy, a recently introduced classifier performance measure for multi-class problems, has a strong (monotone) relation with the multi-class generalization of a classical metric, the Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Computational evidence in support of the claim is provided, together with an outline of the theoretical explanation.	A unifying view for performance measures in multi-class prediction
1502.02309v1	There has been an explosion of interest in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) during the past two decades. Naturally, this has been accompanied by many major advances in the understanding of the human connectome. These advances have served to pose novel challenges as well as open new avenues for research. One of the most promising and exciting of such avenues is the study of functional MRI in real-time. Such studies have recently gained momentum and have been applied in a wide variety of settings; ranging from training of healthy subjects to self-regulate neuronal activity to being suggested as potential treatments for clinical populations. To date, the vast majority of these studies have focused on a single region at a time. This is due in part to the many challenges faced when estimating dynamic functional connectivity networks in real-time. In this work we propose a novel methodology with which to accurately track changes in functional connectivity networks in real-time. We adapt the recently proposed SINGLE algorithm for estimating sparse and temporally homo- geneous dynamic networks to be applicable in real-time. The proposed method is applied to motor task data from the Human Connectome Project as well as to real-time data ob- tained while exploring a virtual environment. We show that the algorithm is able to estimate significant task-related changes in network structure quickly enough to be useful in future brain-computer interface applications.

1709.10041v1	High throughput screening of compounds (chemicals) is an essential part of drug discovery [7], involving thousands to millions of compounds, with the purpose of identifying candidate hits. Most statistical tools, including the industry standard B-score method, work on individual compound plates and do not exploit cross-plate correlation or statistical strength among plates. We present a new statistical framework for high throughput screening of compounds based on Bayesian nonparametric modeling. The proposed approach is able to identify candidate hits from multiple plates simultaneously, sharing statistical strength among plates and providing more robust estimates of compound activity. It can flexibly accommodate arbitrary distributions of compound activities and is applicable to any plate geometry. The algorithm provides a principled statistical approach for hit identification and false discovery rate control. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in hit identification sensitivity and specificity over the B-score method, which is highly sensitive to threshold choice. The framework is implemented as an efficient R extension package BHTSpack and is suitable for large scale data sets.	Bayesian Multi Plate High Throughput Screening of Compounds
1110.6546v1	In a Bayesian learning setting, the posterior distribution of a predictive model arises from a trade-off between its prior distribution and the conditional likelihood of observed data. Such distribution functions usually rely on additional hyperparameters which need to be tuned in order to achieve optimum predictive performance; this operation can be efficiently performed in an Empirical Bayes fashion by maximizing the posterior marginal likelihood of the observed data. Since the score function of this optimization problem is in general characterized by the presence of local optima, it is necessary to resort to global optimization strategies, which require a large number of function evaluations. Given that the evaluation is usually computationally intensive and badly scaled with respect to the dataset size, the maximum number of observations that can be treated simultaneously is quite limited. In this paper, we consider the case of hyperparameter tuning in Gaussian process regression. A straightforward implementation of the posterior log-likelihood for this model requires O(N^3) operations for every iteration of the optimization procedure, where N is the number of examples in the input dataset. We derive a novel set of identities that allow, after an initial overhead of O(N^3), the evaluation of the score function, as well as the Jacobian and Hessian matrices, in O(N) operations. We prove how the proposed identities, that follow from the eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix, yield a reduction of several orders of magnitude in the computation time for the hyperparameter optimization problem. Notably, the proposed solution provides computational advantages even with respect to state of the art approximations that rely on sparse kernel matrices.	Efficient Marginal Likelihood Computation for Gaussian Process  Regression
1612.06061v1	We introduce a novel multivariate random process producing Bernoulli outputs per dimension, that can possibly formalize binary interactions in various graphical structures and can be used to model opinion dynamics, epidemics, financial and biological time series data, etc. We call this a Bernoulli Autoregressive Process (BAR). A BAR process models a discrete-time vector random sequence of $p$ scalar Bernoulli processes with autoregressive dynamics and corresponds to a particular Markov Chain. The benefit from the autoregressive dynamics is the description of a $2^p\times 2^p$ transition matrix by at most $pd$ effective parameters for some $d\ll p$ or by two sparse matrices of dimensions $p\times p^2$ and $p\times p$, respectively, parameterizing the transitions. Additionally, we show that the BAR process mixes rapidly, by proving that the mixing time is $O(\log p)$. The hidden constant in the previous mixing time bound depends explicitly on the values of the chain parameters and implicitly on the maximum allowed in-degree of a node in the corresponding graph. For a network with $p$ nodes, where each node has in-degree at most $d$ and corresponds to a scalar Bernoulli process generated by a BAR, we provide a greedy algorithm that can efficiently learn the structure of the underlying directed graph with a sample complexity proportional to the mixing time of the BAR process. The sample complexity of the proposed algorithm is nearly order-optimal as it is only a $\log p$ factor away from an information-theoretic lower bound. We present simulation results illustrating the performance of our algorithm in various setups, including a model for a biological signaling network.

1708.02999v1	We consider the demixing problem of two (or more) structured high-dimensional vectors from a limited number of nonlinear observations where this nonlinearity is due to either a periodic or an aperiodic function. We study certain families of structured superposition models, and propose a method which provably recovers the components given (nearly) $m = \mathcal{O}(s)$ samples where $s$ denotes the sparsity level of the underlying components. This strictly improves upon previous nonlinear demixing techniques and asymptotically matches the best possible sample complexity. We also provide a range of simulations to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.	Demixing Structured Superposition Signals from Periodic and Aperiodic  Nonlinear Observations
1802.07079v1	This paper is the first work to propose a network to predict a structured uncertainty distribution for a reconstructed image. Our novel model learns to predict a full Gaussian covariance matrix for each reconstruction, which permits efficient sampling and likelihood evaluation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately reconstruct ground truth correlated residual distributions for synthetic datasets and generate plausible high frequency samples for real face images. We also illustrate the use of these predicted covariances for structure preserving image denoising.	Structured Uncertainty Prediction Networks
1705.09353v2	We present a new model, Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks (PSRNNs), for filtering and prediction in dynamical systems. PSRNNs draw on insights from both Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Predictive State Representations (PSRs), and inherit advantages from both types of models. Like many successful RNN architectures, PSRNNs use (potentially deeply composed) bilinear transfer functions to combine information from multiple sources. We show that such bilinear functions arise naturally from state updates in Bayes filters like PSRs, in which observations can be viewed as gating belief states. We also show that PSRNNs can be learned effectively by combining Backpropogation Through Time (BPTT) with an initialization derived from a statistically consistent learning algorithm for PSRs called two-stage regression (2SR). Finally, we show that PSRNNs can be factorized using tensor decomposition, reducing model size and suggesting interesting connections to existing multiplicative architectures such as LSTMs. We applied PSRNNs to 4 datasets, and showed that we outperform several popular alternative approaches to modeling dynamical systems in all cases.

1201.0963v1	Most classification methods are based on the assumption that data conforms to a stationary distribution. The machine learning domain currently suffers from a lack of classification techniques that are able to detect the occurrence of a change in the underlying data distribution. Ignoring possible changes in the underlying concept, also known as concept drift, may degrade the performance of the classification model. Often these changes make the model inconsistent and regular updatings become necessary. Taking the temporal dimension into account during the analysis of Web usage data is a necessity, since the way a site is visited may indeed evolve due to modifications in the structure and content of the site, or even due to changes in the behavior of certain user groups. One solution to this problem, proposed in this article, is to update models using summaries obtained by means of an evolutionary approach based on an intelligent clustering approach. We carry out various clustering strategies that are applied on time sub-periods. To validate our approach we apply two external evaluation criteria which compare different partitions from the same data set. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient to detect the occurrence of changes.	Clustering Dynamic Web Usage Data
1412.0694v3	In theory, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are well suited to streaming data scenarios due to their ability to adapt model complexity with the observed data. Unfortunately, such benefits have not been fully realized in practice; existing inference algorithms are either not applicable to streaming applications or not extensible to BNP models. For the special case of Dirichlet processes, streaming inference has been considered. However, there is growing interest in more flexible BNP models building on the class of normalized random measures (NRMs). We work within this general framework and present a streaming variational inference algorithm for NRM mixture models. Our algorithm is based on assumed density filtering (ADF), leading straightforwardly to expectation propagation (EP) for large-scale batch inference as well. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm on clustering documents in large, streaming text corpora.	Streaming Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Mixture  Models
1605.08299v2	We consider the problem of robustifying high-dimensional structured estimation. Robust techniques are key in real-world applications which often involve outliers and data corruption. We focus on trimmed versions of structurally regularized M-estimators in the high-dimensional setting, including the popular Least Trimmed Squares estimator, as well as analogous estimators for generalized linear models and graphical models, using possibly non-convex loss functions. We present a general analysis of their statistical convergence rates and consistency, and then take a closer look at the trimmed versions of the Lasso and Graphical Lasso estimators as special cases. On the optimization side, we show how to extend algorithms for M-estimators to fit trimmed variants and provide guarantees on their numerical convergence. The generality and competitive performance of high-dimensional trimmed estimators are illustrated numerically on both simulated and real-world genomics data.	A General Family of Trimmed Estimators for Robust High-dimensional Data  Analysis
1507.04505v1	We highlight a pitfall when applying stochastic variational inference to general Bayesian networks. For global random variables approximated by an exponential family distribution, natural gradient steps, commonly starting from a unit length step size, are averaged to convergence. This useful insight into the scaling of initial step sizes is lost when the approximation factorizes across a general Bayesian network, and care must be taken to ensure practical convergence. We experimentally investigate how much of the baby (well-scaled steps) is thrown out with the bath water (exact gradients).	On the Convergence of Stochastic Variational Inference in Bayesian  Networks
1707.05532v1	We propose a fast inference method for Bayesian nonlinear support vector machines that leverages stochastic variational inference and inducing points. Our experiments show that the proposed method is faster than competing Bayesian approaches and scales easily to millions of data points. It provides additional features over frequentist competitors such as accurate predictive uncertainty estimates and automatic hyperparameter search.

1708.07480v1	Prediction of disease onset from patient survey and lifestyle data is quickly becoming an important tool for diagnosing a disease before it progresses. In this study, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) questionnaire is used to predict the onset of type II diabetes. An ensemble model using the output of five classification algorithms was developed to predict the onset on diabetes based on 16 features. The ensemble model had an AUC of 0.834 indicating high performance.	An Ensemble Classifier for Predicting the Onset of Type II Diabetes
1802.06455v1	Deep neural networks have led to a series of breakthroughs, dramatically improving the state-of-the-art in many domains. The techniques driving these advances, however, lack a formal method to account for model uncertainty. While the Bayesian approach to learning provides a solid theoretical framework to handle uncertainty, inference in Bayesian-inspired deep neural networks is difficult. In this paper, we provide a practical approach to Bayesian learning that relies on a regularization technique found in nearly every modern network, \textit{batch normalization}. We show that training a deep network using batch normalization is equivalent to approximate inference in Bayesian models, and we demonstrate how this finding allows us to make useful estimates of the model uncertainty. With our approach, it is possible to make meaningful uncertainty estimates using conventional architectures without modifying the network or the training procedure. Our approach is thoroughly validated in a series of empirical experiments on different tasks and using various measures, outperforming baselines with strong statistical significance and displaying competitive performance with other recent Bayesian approaches.	Bayesian Uncertainty Estimation for Batch Normalized Deep Networks
1509.08327v2	We consider continuous time Markovian processes where populations of individual agents interact stochastically according to kinetic rules. Despite the increasing prominence of such models in fields ranging from biology to smart cities, Bayesian inference for such systems remains challenging, as these are continuous time, discrete state systems with potentially infinite state-space. Here we propose a novel efficient algorithm for joint state / parameter posterior sampling in population Markov Jump processes. We introduce a class of pseudo-marginal sampling algorithms based on a random truncation method which enables a principled treatment of infinite state spaces. Extensive evaluation on a number of benchmark models shows that this approach achieves considerable savings compared to state of the art methods, retaining accuracy and fast convergence. We also present results on a synthetic biology data set showing the potential for practical usefulness of our work.	Unbiased Bayesian Inference for Population Markov Jump Processes via  Random Truncations
1705.07751v1	In many distributed learning problems, the heterogeneous loading of computing machines may harm the overall performance of synchronous strategies. In this paper, we propose an effective asynchronous distributed framework for the minimization of a sum of smooth functions, where each machine performs iterations in parallel on its local function and updates a shared parameter asynchronously. In this way, all machines can continuously work even though they do not have the latest version of the shared parameter. We prove the convergence of the consistency of this general distributed asynchronous method for gradient iterations then show its efficiency on the matrix factorization problem for recommender systems and on binary classification.	An Asynchronous Distributed Framework for Large-scale Learning Based on  Parameter Exchanges
1202.3708v1	We study the problem of learning high dimensional regression models regularized by a structured-sparsity-inducing penalty that encodes prior structural information on either input or output sides. We consider two widely adopted types of such penalties as our motivating examples: 1) overlapping group lasso penalty, based on the l1/l2 mixed-norm penalty, and 2) graph-guided fusion penalty. For both types of penalties, due to their non-separability, developing an efficient optimization method has remained a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a general optimization approach, called smoothing proximal gradient method, which can solve the structured sparse regression problems with a smooth convex loss and a wide spectrum of structured-sparsity-inducing penalties. Our approach is based on a general smoothing technique of Nesterov. It achieves a convergence rate faster than the standard first-order method, subgradient method, and is much more scalable than the most widely used interior-point method. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed method.	Smoothing Proximal Gradient Method for General Structured Sparse  Learning
1403.5112v1	In the synthesis model signals are represented as a sparse combinations of atoms from a dictionary. Dictionary learning describes the acquisition process of the underlying dictionary for a given set of training samples. While ideally this would be achieved by optimizing the expectation of the factors over the underlying distribution of the training data, in practice the necessary information about the distribution is not available. Therefore, in real world applications it is achieved by minimizing an empirical average over the available samples. The main goal of this paper is to provide a sample complexity estimate that controls to what extent the empirical average deviates from the cost function. This estimate then provides a suitable estimate to the accuracy of the representation of the learned dictionary. The presented approach exemplifies the general results proposed by the authors in Sample Complexity of Dictionary Learning and other Matrix Factorizations, Gribonval et al. and gives more concrete bounds of the sample complexity of dictionary learning. We cover a variety of sparsity measures employed in the learning procedure.	On The Sample Complexity of Sparse Dictionary Learning
1508.02810v2	We consider the problem of minimizing a sum of $n$ functions over a convex parameter set $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathbb{R}^p$ where $n\gg p\gg 1$. In this regime, algorithms which utilize sub-sampling techniques are known to be effective. In this paper, we use sub-sampling techniques together with low-rank approximation to design a new randomized batch algorithm which possesses comparable convergence rate to Newton's method, yet has much smaller per-iteration cost. The proposed algorithm is robust in terms of starting point and step size, and enjoys a composite convergence rate, namely, quadratic convergence at start and linear convergence when the iterate is close to the minimizer. We develop its theoretical analysis which also allows us to select near-optimal algorithm parameters. Our theoretical results can be used to obtain convergence rates of previously proposed sub-sampling based algorithms as well. We demonstrate how our results apply to well-known machine learning problems. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several datasets under various scenarios.	Convergence rates of sub-sampled Newton methods
1505.06723v1	We empirically evaluate a stochastic annealing strategy for Bayesian posterior optimization with variational inference. Variational inference is a deterministic approach to approximate posterior inference in Bayesian models in which a typically non-convex objective function is locally optimized over the parameters of the approximating distribution. We investigate an annealing method for optimizing this objective with the aim of finding a better local optimal solution and compare with deterministic annealing methods and no annealing. We show that stochastic annealing can provide clear improvement on the GMM and HMM, while performance on LDA tends to favor deterministic annealing methods.	Stochastic Annealing for Variational Inference
1711.11053v1	We propose a framework for general probabilistic multi-step time series regression. Specifically, we exploit the expressiveness and temporal nature of Recurrent Neural Networks, the nonparametric nature of Quantile Regression and the efficiency of Direct Multi-Horizon Forecasting. A new training scheme for recurrent nets is designed to boost stability and performance. We show that the approach accommodates both temporal and static covariates, learning across multiple related series, shifting seasonality, future planned event spikes and cold-starts in real life large-scale forecasting. The performance of the framework is demonstrated in an application to predict the future demand of items sold on Amazon.com, and in a public probabilistic forecasting competition to predict electricity price and load.

1011.4832v3	Modern statistical applications involving large data sets have focused attention on statistical methodologies which are both efficient computationally and able to deal with the screening of large numbers of different candidate models. Here we consider computationally efficient variational Bayes approaches to inference in high-dimensional heteroscedastic linear regression, where both the mean and variance are described in terms of linear functions of the predictors and where the number of predictors can be larger than the sample size. We derive a closed form variational lower bound on the log marginal likelihood useful for model selection, and propose a novel fast greedy search algorithm on the model space which makes use of one step optimization updates to the variational lower bound in the current model for screening large numbers of candidate predictor variables for inclusion/exclusion in a computationally thrifty way. We show that the model search strategy we suggest is related to widely used orthogonal matching pursuit algorithms for model search but yields a framework for potentially extending these algorithms to more complex models. The methodology is applied in simulations and in two real examples involving prediction for food constituents using NIR technology and prediction of disease progression in diabetes.	Variational approximation for heteroscedastic linear models and matching  pursuit algorithms
0709.2936v1	This thesis responds to the challenges of using a large number, such as thousands, of features in regression and classification problems. There are two situations where such high dimensional features arise. One is when high dimensional measurements are available, for example, gene expression data produced by microarray techniques. For computational or other reasons, people may select only a small subset of features when modelling such data, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response, based on some measure such as correlation with the response in the training data. Although it is used very commonly, this procedure will make the response appear more predictable than it actually is. In Chapter 2, we propose a Bayesian method to avoid this selection bias, with application to naive Bayes models and mixture models. High dimensional features also arise when we consider high-order interactions. The number of parameters will increase exponentially with the order considered. In Chapter 3, we propose a method for compressing a group of parameters into a single one, by exploiting the fact that many predictor variables derived from high-order interactions have the same values for all the training cases. The number of compressed parameters may have converged before considering the highest possible order. We apply this compression method to logistic sequence prediction models and logistic classification models. We use both simulated data and real data to test our methods in both chapters.	Bayesian Classification and Regression with High Dimensional Features
1709.00776v1	The interpretability of prediction mechanisms with respect to the underlying prediction problem is often unclear. While several studies have focused on developing prediction models with meaningful parameters, the causal relationships between the predictors and the actual prediction have not been considered. Here, we connect the underlying causal structure of a data generation process and the causal structure of a prediction mechanism. To achieve this, we propose a framework that identifies the feature with the greatest causal influence on the prediction and estimates the necessary causal intervention of a feature such that a desired prediction is obtained. The general concept of the framework has no restrictions regarding data linearity; however, we focus on an implementation for linear data here. The framework applicability is evaluated using artificial data and demonstrated using real-world data.	Estimation of interventional effects of features on prediction
1502.04315v1	We present a novel algorithm, Westfall-Young light, for detecting patterns, such as itemsets and subgraphs, which are statistically significantly enriched in one of two classes. Our method corrects rigorously for multiple hypothesis testing and correlations between patterns through the Westfall-Young permutation procedure, which empirically estimates the null distribution of pattern frequencies in each class via permutations. In our experiments, Westfall-Young light dramatically outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach in terms of both runtime and memory efficiency on popular real-world benchmark datasets for pattern mining. The key to this efficiency is that unlike all existing methods, our algorithm neither needs to solve the underlying frequent itemset mining problem anew for each permutation nor needs to store the occurrence list of all frequent patterns. Westfall-Young light opens the door to significant pattern mining on large datasets that previously led to prohibitive runtime or memory costs.

1311.4025v3	In this work we compute lower Lipschitz bounds of $\ell_p$ pooling operators for $p=1, 2, \infty$ as well as $\ell_p$ pooling operators preceded by half-rectification layers. These give sufficient conditions for the design of invertible neural network layers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and image patches confirm that pooling layers can be inverted with phase recovery algorithms. Moreover, the regularity of the inverse pooling, controlled by the lower Lipschitz constant, is empirically verified with a nearest neighbor regression.	Signal Recovery from Pooling Representations
1605.05860v3	With the rapid growth of crowdsourcing platforms it has become easy and relatively inexpensive to collect a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short time. However due to the lack of control over the quality of the annotators, some abnormal annotators may be affected by position bias which can potentially degrade the quality of the final consensus labels. In this paper we introduce a statistical framework to model and detect annotator's position bias in order to control the false discovery rate (FDR) without a prior knowledge on the amount of biased annotators - the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries being not too high, in order to assure that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. The key technical development relies on some new knockoff filters adapted to our problem and new algorithms based on the Inverse Scale Space dynamics whose discretization is potentially suitable for large scale crowdsourcing data analysis. Our studies are supported by experiments with both simulated examples and real-world data. The proposed framework provides us a useful tool for quantitatively studying annotator's abnormal behavior in crowdsourcing data arising from machine learning, sociology, computer vision, multimedia, etc.	False Discovery Rate Control and Statistical Quality Assessment of  Annotators in Crowdsourced Ranking
1004.3101v1	In this paper we formulate in general terms an approach to prove strong consistency of the Empirical Risk Minimisation inductive principle applied to the prototype or distance based clustering. This approach was motivated by the Divisive Information-Theoretic Feature Clustering model in probabilistic space with Kullback-Leibler divergence which may be regarded as a special case within the Clustering Minimisation framework. Also, we propose clustering regularization restricting creation of additional clusters which are not significant or are not essentially different comparing with existing clusters.	Strong Consistency of Prototype Based Clustering in Probabilistic Space
1801.06147v1	Gaussian process priors are commonly used in aerospace design for performing Bayesian optimization. Nonetheless, Gaussian processes suffer two significant drawbacks: outliers are a priori assumed unlikely, and the posterior variance conditioned on observed data depends only on the locations of those data, not the associated sample values. Student's-T processes are a generalization of Gaussian processes, founded on the Student's-T distribution instead of the Gaussian distribution. Student's-T processes maintain the primary advantages of Gaussian processes (kernel function, analytic update rule) with additional benefits beyond Gaussian processes. The Student's-T distribution has higher Kurtosis than a Gaussian distribution and so outliers are much more likely, and the posterior variance increases or decreases depending on the variance of observed data sample values. Here, we describe Student's-T processes, and discuss their advantages in the context of aerospace optimization. We show how to construct a Student's-T process using a kernel function and how to update the process given new samples. We provide a clear derivation of optimization-relevant quantities such as expected improvement, and contrast with the related computations for Gaussian processes. Finally, we compare the performance of Student's-T processes against Gaussian process on canonical test problems in Bayesian optimization, and apply the Student's-T process to the optimization of an aerostructural design problem.	Upgrading from Gaussian Processes to Student's-T Processes
1205.2612v1	We study the problem of learning Bayesian network structures from data. Koivisto and Sood (2004) and Koivisto (2006) presented algorithms that can compute the exact marginal posterior probability of a subnetwork, e.g., a single edge, in O(n2n) time and the posterior probabilities for all n(n-1) potential edges in O(n2n) total time, assuming that the number of parents per node or the indegree is bounded by a constant. One main drawback of their algorithms is the requirement of a special structure prior that is non uniform and does not respect Markov equivalence. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that can compute the exact posterior probability of a subnetwork in O(3n) time and the posterior probabilities for all n(n-1) potential edges in O(n3n) total time. Our algorithm also assumes a bounded indegree but allows general structure priors. We demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm on several data sets with up to 20 variables.

1107.4506v2	This paper studies the deviations of the regret in a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. When the total number of plays n is known beforehand by the agent, Audibert et al. (2009) exhibit a policy such that with probability at least 1-1/n, the regret of the policy is of order log(n). They have also shown that such a property is not shared by the popular ucb1 policy of Auer et al. (2002). This work first answers an open question: it extends this negative result to any anytime policy. The second contribution of this paper is to design anytime robust policies for specific multi-armed bandit problems in which some restrictions are put on the set of possible distributions of the different arms.	Robustness of Anytime Bandit Policies
1310.1867v4	Significant success has been reported recently using deep neural networks for classification. Such large networks can be computationally intensive, even after training is over. Implementing these trained networks in hardware chips with a limited precision of synaptic weights may improve their speed and energy efficiency by several orders of magnitude, thus enabling their integration into small and low-power electronic devices. With this motivation, we develop a computationally efficient learning algorithm for multilayer neural networks with binary weights, assuming all the hidden neurons have a fan-out of one. This algorithm, derived within a Bayesian probabilistic online setting, is shown to work well for both synthetic and real-world problems, performing comparably to algorithms with real-valued weights, while retaining computational tractability.

1711.05610v2	Given a vertex of interest in a network $G_1$, the vertex nomination problem seeks to find the corresponding vertex of interest (if it exists) in a second network $G_2$. Although the vertex nomination problem and related tasks have attracted much attention in the machine learning literature, with applications to social and biological networks, the framework has so far been confined to a comparatively small class of network models, and the concept of statistically consistent vertex nomination schemes has been only shallowly explored. In this paper, we extend the vertex nomination problem to a very general statistical model of graphs. Further, drawing inspiration from the long-established classification framework in the pattern recognition literature, we provide definitions for the key notions of Bayes optimality and consistency in our extended vertex nomination framework, including a derivation of the Bayes optimal vertex nomination scheme. In addition, we prove that no universally consistent vertex nomination schemes exist. Illustrative examples are provided throughout.	On consistent vertex nomination schemes
1007.3564v3	It is difficult to find the optimal sparse solution of a manifold learning based dimensionality reduction algorithm. The lasso or the elastic net penalized manifold learning based dimensionality reduction is not directly a lasso penalized least square problem and thus the least angle regression (LARS) (Efron et al. \cite{LARS}), one of the most popular algorithms in sparse learning, cannot be applied. Therefore, most current approaches take indirect ways or have strict settings, which can be inconvenient for applications. In this paper, we proposed the manifold elastic net or MEN for short. MEN incorporates the merits of both the manifold learning based dimensionality reduction and the sparse learning based dimensionality reduction. By using a series of equivalent transformations, we show MEN is equivalent to the lasso penalized least square problem and thus LARS is adopted to obtain the optimal sparse solution of MEN. In particular, MEN has the following advantages for subsequent classification: 1) the local geometry of samples is well preserved for low dimensional data representation, 2) both the margin maximization and the classification error minimization are considered for sparse projection calculation, 3) the projection matrix of MEN improves the parsimony in computation, 4) the elastic net penalty reduces the over-fitting problem, and 5) the projection matrix of MEN can be interpreted psychologically and physiologically. Experimental evidence on face recognition over various popular datasets suggests that MEN is superior to top level dimensionality reduction algorithms.

1310.3745v2	Mixed linear regression involves the recovery of two (or more) unknown vectors from unlabeled linear measurements; that is, where each sample comes from exactly one of the vectors, but we do not know which one. It is a classic problem, and the natural and empirically most popular approach to its solution has been the EM algorithm. As in other settings, this is prone to bad local minima; however, each iteration is very fast (alternating between guessing labels, and solving with those labels). In this paper we provide a new initialization procedure for EM, based on finding the leading two eigenvectors of an appropriate matrix. We then show that with this, a re-sampled version of the EM algorithm provably converges to the correct vectors, under natural assumptions on the sampling distribution, and with nearly optimal (unimprovable) sample complexity. This provides not only the first characterization of EM's performance, but also much lower sample complexity as compared to both standard (randomly initialized) EM, and other methods for this problem.	Alternating Minimization for Mixed Linear Regression
1702.07190v1	In this paper, we propose PCKID, a novel, robust, kernel function for spectral clustering, specifically designed to handle incomplete data. By combining posterior distributions of Gaussian Mixture Models for incomplete data on different scales, we are able to learn a kernel for incomplete data that does not depend on any critical hyperparameters, unlike the commonly used RBF kernel. To evaluate our method, we perform experiments on two real datasets. PCKID outperforms the baseline methods for all fractions of missing values and in some cases outperforms the baseline methods with up to 25 percentage points.

1105.0363v2	"Inverse inference, or ""brain reading"", is a recent paradigm for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, based on pattern recognition and statistical learning. By predicting some cognitive variables related to brain activation maps, this approach aims at decoding brain activity. Inverse inference takes into account the multivariate information between voxels and is currently the only way to assess how precisely some cognitive information is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the whole brain. However, it relies on a prediction function that is plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since there are far more features than samples, i.e., more voxels than fMRI volumes. To address this problem, different methods have been proposed, such as, among others, univariate feature selection, feature agglomeration and regularization techniques. In this paper, we consider a sparse hierarchical structured regularization. Specifically, the penalization we use is constructed from a tree that is obtained by spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering. This approach encodes the spatial structure of the data at different scales into the regularization, which makes the overall prediction procedure more robust to inter-subject variability. The regularization used induces the selection of spatially coherent predictive brain regions simultaneously at different scales. We test our algorithm on real data acquired to study the mental representation of objects, and we show that the proposed algorithm not only delineates meaningful brain regions but yields as well better prediction accuracy than reference methods."

1203.6452v1	Recently, a lot of effort has been paid to the efficient computation of Kriging predictors when observations are assimilated sequentially. In particular, Kriging update formulae enabling significant computational savings were derived in Barnes and Watson (1992), Gao et al. (1996), and Emery (2009). Taking advantage of the previous Kriging mean and variance calculations helps avoiding a costly $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ matrix inversion when adding one observation to the $n$ already available ones. In addition to traditional update formulae taking into account a single new observation, Emery (2009) also proposed formulae for the batch-sequential case, i.e. when $r > 1$ new observations are simultaneously assimilated. However, the Kriging variance and covariance formulae given without proof in Emery (2009) for the batch-sequential case are not correct. In this paper we fix this issue and establish corrected expressions for updated Kriging variances and covariances when assimilating several observations in parallel.

1104.1234v1	Computational approaches to transcription factor binding site identification have been actively researched for the past decade. Negative examples have long been utilized in de novo motif discovery and have been shown useful in transcription factor binding site search as well. However, understanding of the roles of negative examples in binding site search is still very limited. We propose the 2-centroid and optimal discriminating vector methods, taking into account negative examples. Cross-validation results on E. coli transcription factors show that the proposed methods benefit from negative examples, outperforming the centroid and position-specific scoring matrix methods. We further show that our proposed methods perform better than a state-of-the-art method. We characterize the proposed methods in the context of the other compared methods and show that, coupled with motif subtype identification, the proposed methods can be effectively applied to a wide range of transcription factors. Finally, we argue that the proposed methods are well-suited for eukaryotic transcription factors as well.

1504.07027v2	The variational framework for learning inducing variables (Titsias, 2009a) has had a large impact on the Gaussian process literature. The framework may be interpreted as minimizing a rigorously defined Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and posterior processes. To our knowledge this connection has thus far gone unremarked in the literature. In this paper we give a substantial generalization of the literature on this topic. We give a new proof of the result for infinite index sets which allows inducing points that are not data points and likelihoods that depend on all function values. We then discuss augmented index sets and show that, contrary to previous works, marginal consistency of augmentation is not enough to guarantee consistency of variational inference with the original model. We then characterize an extra condition where such a guarantee is obtainable. Finally we show how our framework sheds light on interdomain sparse approximations and sparse approximations for Cox processes.

1710.02952v1	We propose new algorithms for topic modeling when the number of topics is unknown. Our approach relies on an analysis of the concentration of mass and angular geometry of the topic simplex, a convex polytope constructed by taking the convex hull of vertices representing the latent topics. Our algorithms are shown in practice to have accuracy comparable to a Gibbs sampler in terms of topic estimation, which requires the number of topics be given. Moreover, they are one of the fastest among several state of the art parametric techniques. Statistical consistency of our estimator is established under some conditions.

1204.5721v2	Multi-armed bandit problems are the most basic examples of sequential decision problems with an exploration-exploitation trade-off. This is the balance between staying with the option that gave highest payoffs in the past and exploring new options that might give higher payoffs in the future. Although the study of bandit problems dates back to the Thirties, exploration-exploitation trade-offs arise in several modern applications, such as ad placement, website optimization, and packet routing. Mathematically, a multi-armed bandit is defined by the payoff process associated with each option. In this survey, we focus on two extreme cases in which the analysis of regret is particularly simple and elegant: i.i.d. payoffs and adversarial payoffs. Besides the basic setting of finitely many actions, we also analyze some of the most important variants and extensions, such as the contextual bandit model.

1103.1761v3	Inference in popular nonparametric Bayesian models typically relies on sampling or other approximations. This paper presents a general methodology for constructing novel tractable nonparametric Bayesian methods by applying the kernel trick to inference in a parametric Bayesian model. For example, Gaussian process regression can be derived this way from Bayesian linear regression. Despite the success of the Gaussian process framework, the kernel trick is rarely explicitly considered in the Bayesian literature. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and demonstrate the potential of applying the kernel trick to tractable Bayesian parametric models in a wider context than just regression. As an example, we present an intuitive Bayesian kernel machine for density estimation that is obtained by applying the kernel trick to a Gaussian generative model in feature space.	A Kernel Approach to Tractable Bayesian Nonparametrics
1109.2553v2	When response variables are nominal and populations are cross-classified with respect to multiple polytomies, questions often arise about the degree of association of the responses with explanatory variables. When populations are known, we introduce a nominal association vector and matrix to evaluate the dependence of a response variable with an explanatory variable. These measures provide detailed evaluations of nominal associations at both local and global levels. We also define a general class of global association measures which embraces the well known association measure by Goodman-Kruskal (1954). The proposed association matrix also gives rise to the expected generalized confusion matrix in classification. The hierarchy of equivalence relations defined by the association vector and matrix are also shown.	Nominal Association Vector and Matrix
0911.0280v1	Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables from a finite sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently, methods using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of continuous variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest are discrete or even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the notion of additive noise models to these cases. We prove that whenever the joint distribution $\prob^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g. $Y=f(X)+N, N \independent X$, it does not admit the reversed model $X=g(Y)+\tilde N, \tilde N \independent Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a generic way. Based on these deliberations we propose an efficient new algorithm that is able to distinguish between cause and effect for a finite sample of discrete variables. In an extensive experimental study we show that this algorithm works both on synthetic and real data sets.	Causal Inference on Discrete Data using Additive Noise Models
1506.03164v2	The modern scale of data has brought new challenges to Bayesian inference. In particular, conventional MCMC algorithms are computationally very expensive for large data sets. A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies random partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is distribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales. We provide theoretical justification and extensive experiments illustrating empirical performance.	Parallelizing MCMC with Random Partition Trees
1002.3315v2	Variable selection in high dimensional space has challenged many contemporary statistical problems from many frontiers of scientific disciplines. Recent technology advance has made it possible to collect a huge amount of covariate information such as microarray, proteomic and SNP data via bioimaging technology while observing survival information on patients in clinical studies. Thus, the same challenge applies to the survival analysis in order to understand the association between genomics information and clinical information about the survival time. In this work, we extend the sure screening procedure Fan and Lv (2008) to Cox's proportional hazards model with an iterative version available. Numerical simulation studies have shown encouraging performance of the proposed method in comparison with other techniques such as LASSO. This demonstrates the utility and versatility of the iterative sure independent screening scheme.	High-dimensional variable selection for Cox's proportional hazards model
1008.4988v1	Since learning is typically very slow in Boltzmann machines, there is a need to restrict connections within hidden layers. However, the resulting states of hidden units exhibit statistical dependencies. Based on this observation, we propose using $l_1/l_2$ regularization upon the activation possibilities of hidden units in restricted Boltzmann machines to capture the loacal dependencies among hidden units. This regularization not only encourages hidden units of many groups to be inactive given observed data but also makes hidden units within a group compete with each other for modeling observed data. Thus, the $l_1/l_2$ regularization on RBMs yields sparsity at both the group and the hidden unit levels. We call RBMs trained with the regularizer \emph{sparse group} RBMs. The proposed sparse group RBMs are applied to three tasks: modeling patches of natural images, modeling handwritten digits and pretaining a deep networks for a classification task. Furthermore, we illustrate the regularizer can also be applied to deep Boltzmann machines, which lead to sparse group deep Boltzmann machines. When adapted to the MNIST data set, a two-layer sparse group Boltzmann machine achieves an error rate of $0.84\%$, which is, to our knowledge, the best published result on the permutation-invariant version of the MNIST task.	Sparse Group Restricted Boltzmann Machines
1409.6179v1	Variational inference is a powerful concept that underlies many iterative approximation algorithms; expectation propagation, mean-field methods and belief propagations were all central themes at the school that can be perceived from this unifying framework. The lectures of Manfred Opper introduce the archetypal example of Expectation Propagation, before establishing the connection with the other approximation methods. Corrections by expansion about the expectation propagation are then explained. Finally some advanced inference topics and applications are explored in the final sections.	Expectation Propagation
1109.1990v1	Using the $\ell_1$-norm to regularize the estimation of the parameter vector of a linear model leads to an unstable estimator when covariates are highly correlated. In this paper, we introduce a new penalty function which takes into account the correlation of the design matrix to stabilize the estimation. This norm, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm, which is a convex surrogate of the rank, of the selected covariates as the criterion of model complexity. We analyze the properties of our norm, describe an optimization algorithm based on reweighted least-squares, and illustrate the behavior of this norm on synthetic data, showing that it is more adapted to strong correlations than competing methods such as the elastic net.	Trace Lasso: a trace norm regularization for correlated designs
1202.3769v1	We face network data from various sources, such as protein interactions and online social networks. A critical problem is to model network interactions and identify latent groups of network nodes. This problem is challenging due to many reasons. For example, the network nodes are interdependent instead of independent of each other, and the data are known to be very noisy (e.g., missing edges). To address these challenges, we propose a new relational model for network data, Sparse Matrix-variate Gaussian process Blockmodel (SMGB). Our model generalizes popular bilinear generative models and captures nonlinear network interactions using a matrix-variate Gaussian process with latent membership variables. We also assign sparse prior distributions on the latent membership variables to learn sparse group assignments for individual network nodes. To estimate the latent variables efficiently from data, we develop an efficient variational expectation maximization method. We compared our approaches with several state-of-the-art network models on both synthetic and real-world network datasets. Experimental results demonstrate SMGBs outperform the alternative approaches in terms of discovering latent classes or predicting unknown interactions.

1710.01410v3	"A parametric point process model is developed, with modeling based on the assumption that sequential observations often share latent phenomena, while also possessing idiosyncratic effects. An alternating optimization method is proposed to learn a ""registered"" point process that accounts for shared structure, as well as ""warping"" functions that characterize idiosyncratic aspects of each observed sequence. Under reasonable constraints, in each iteration we update the sample-specific warping functions by solving a set of constrained nonlinear programming problems in parallel, and update the model by maximum likelihood estimation. The justifiability, complexity and robustness of the proposed method are investigated in detail, and the influence of sequence stitching on the learning results is examined empirically. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the method yields explainable point process models, achieving encouraging results compared to state-of-the-art methods."	Learning Registered Point Processes from Idiosyncratic Observations
1506.05967v3	Nonparametric extension of tensor regression is proposed. Nonlinearity in a high-dimensional tensor space is broken into simple local functions by incorporating low-rank tensor decomposition. Compared to naive nonparametric approaches, our formulation considerably improves the convergence rate of estimation while maintaining consistency with the same function class under specific conditions. To estimate local functions, we develop a Bayesian estimator with the Gaussian process prior. Experimental results show its theoretical properties and high performance in terms of predicting a summary statistic of a real complex network.	Doubly Decomposing Nonparametric Tensor Regression
1603.05729v3	The Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm has achieved notable success in training energy-based models including Restricted Boltzmann Machines and played a key role in the emergence of deep learning. The idea of this algorithm is to approximate the intractable term in the exact gradient of the log-likelihood function by using short Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs. The approximate gradient is computationally-cheap but biased. Whether and why the CD algorithm provides an asymptotically consistent estimate are still open questions. This paper studies the asymptotic properties of the CD algorithm in canonical exponential families, which are special cases of the energy-based model. Suppose the CD algorithm runs $m$ MCMC transition steps at each iteration $t$ and iteratively generates a sequence of parameter estimates $\{\theta_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ given an i.i.d. data sample $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n \sim p_{\theta_\star}$. Under conditions which are commonly obeyed by the CD algorithm in practice, we prove the existence of some bounded $m$ such that any limit point of the time average $\left. \sum_{s=0}^{t-1} \theta_s \right/ t$ as $t \to \infty$ is a consistent estimate for the true parameter $\theta_\star$. Our proof is based on the fact that $\{\theta_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ is a homogenous Markov chain conditional on the data sample $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$. This chain meets the Foster-Lyapunov drift criterion and converges to a random walk around the Maximum Likelihood Estimate. The range of the random walk shrinks to zero at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{n})$ as the sample size $n \to \infty$.	Convergence of Contrastive Divergence Algorithm in Exponential Family
1705.03297v1	We present semiparametric spectral modeling of the complete larval Drosophila mushroom body connectome. Motivated by a thorough exploratory data analysis of the network via Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) in the adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) representation space, we introduce the latent structure model (LSM) for network modeling and inference. LSM is a generalization of the stochastic block model (SBM) and a special case of the random dot product graph (RDPG) latent position model, and is amenable to semiparametric GMM in the ASE representation space. The resulting connectome code derived via semiparametric GMM composed with ASE captures latent connectome structure and elucidates biologically relevant neuronal properties.

1404.1238v3	This paper considers the problem of estimating the structure of multiple related directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. Building on recent developments in exact estimation of DAGs using integer linear programming (ILP), we present an ILP approach for joint estimation over multiple DAGs, that does not require that the vertices in each DAG share a common ordering. Furthermore, we allow also for (potentially unknown) dependency structure between the DAGs. Results are presented on both simulated data and fMRI data obtained from multiple subjects.	Exact Estimation of Multiple Directed Acyclic Graphs
1706.08936v2	We study the problem of learning latent variables in Gaussian graphical models. Existing methods for this problem assume that the precision matrix of the observed variables is the superposition of a sparse and a low-rank component. In this paper, we focus on the estimation of the low-rank component, which encodes the effect of marginalization over the latent variables. We introduce fast, proper learning algorithms for this problem. In contrast with existing approaches, our algorithms are manifestly non-convex. We support their efficacy via a rigorous theoretical analysis, and show that our algorithms match the best possible in terms of sample complexity, while achieving computational speed-ups over existing methods. We complement our theory with several numerical experiments.	Fast Algorithms for Learning Latent Variables in Graphical Models
1410.7383v6	Motivated by large-scale Collaborative-Filtering applications, we present a Non-Commuting Latent Factor (NCLF) tensor-completion approach for modeling three-way arrays, which is diagonal like the standard PARAFAC, but wherein different terms distinguish different kinds of three-way relations of co-clusters, as determined by permutations of latent factors. The first key component of the algebraic representation is the usage of two non-commutative real trilinear operations as the building blocks of the approximation. These operations are the standard three dimensional triple-product and a trilinear product on a two-dimensional real vector space, which is a representation of the real Clifford Algebra Cl(1,1) (a certain Majorana spinor). Both operations are purely ternary in that they cannot be decomposed into two group-operations on the relevant spaces. The second key component of the method is combining these operations using permutation-symmetry preserving linear combinations. We apply the model to the MovieLens and Fannie Mae datasets, and find that it outperforms the PARAFAC model. We propose some future directions, such as unsupervised-learning.

1202.3079v1	We address the online linear optimization problem with bandit feedback. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide an algorithm (based on exponential weights) with a regret of order $\sqrt{d n \log N}$ for any finite action set with $N$ actions, under the assumption that the instantaneous loss is bounded by 1. This shaves off an extraneous $\sqrt{d}$ factor compared to previous works, and gives a regret bound of order $d \sqrt{n \log n}$ for any compact set of actions. Without further assumptions on the action set, this last bound is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Interestingly, our result also shows that the minimax regret for bandit linear optimization with expert advice in $d$ dimension is the same as for the basic $d$-armed bandit with expert advice. Our second contribution is to show how to use the Mirror Descent algorithm to obtain computationally efficient strategies with minimax optimal regret bounds in specific examples. More precisely we study two canonical action sets: the hypercube and the Euclidean ball. In the former case, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithm with a $d \sqrt{n}$ regret, thus improving by a factor $\sqrt{d \log n}$ over the best known result for a computationally efficient algorithm. In the latter case, our approach gives the first algorithm with a $\sqrt{d n \log n}$ regret, again shaving off an extraneous $\sqrt{d}$ compared to previous works.	Towards minimax policies for online linear optimization with bandit  feedback
1111.6085v3	This paper addresses the estimation of the latent dimensionality in nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the \beta-divergence. The \beta-divergence is a family of cost functions that includes the squared Euclidean distance, Kullback-Leibler and Itakura-Saito divergences as special cases. Learning the model order is important as it is necessary to strike the right balance between data fidelity and overfitting. We propose a Bayesian model based on automatic relevance determination in which the columns of the dictionary matrix and the rows of the activation matrix are tied together through a common scale parameter in their prior. A family of majorization-minimization algorithms is proposed for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. A subset of scale parameters is driven to a small lower bound in the course of inference, with the effect of pruning the corresponding spurious components. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithms by performing extensive experiments on synthetic data, the swimmer dataset, a music decomposition example and a stock price prediction task.

1510.02041v3	"We consider the \mnk{classical} problem of a controller activating (or sampling) sequentially from a finite number of $N \geq 2$ populations, specified by unknown distributions. Over some time horizon, at each time $n = 1, 2, \ldots$, the controller wishes to select a population to sample, with the goal of sampling from a population that optimizes some ""score"" function of its distribution, e.g., maximizing the expected sum of outcomes or minimizing variability. We define a class of \textit{Uniformly Fast (UF)} sampling policies and show, under mild regularity conditions, that there is an asymptotic lower bound for the expected total number of sub-optimal population activations. Then, we provide sufficient conditions under which a UCB policy is UF and asymptotically optimal, since it attains this lower bound. Explicit solutions are provided for a number of examples of interest, including general score functionals on unconstrained Pareto distributions (of potentially infinite mean), and uniform distributions of unknown support. Additional results on bandits of Normal distributions are also provided."	Asymptotically Optimal Sequential Experimentation Under Generalized  Ranking

1705.00003v3	Sales forecasting plays a prominent role in business planning and business strategy. The value and importance of advance information is a cornerstone of planning activity, and a well-set forecast goal can guide sale-force more efficiently. In this paper CPU sales forecasting of Intel Corporation, a multinational semiconductor industry, was considered. Past sale, future booking, exchange rates, Gross domestic product (GDP) forecasting, seasonality and other indicators were innovatively incorporated into the quantitative modeling. Benefit from the recent advances in computation power and software development, millions of models built upon multiple regressions, time series analysis, random forest and boosting tree were executed in parallel. The models with smaller validation errors were selected to form the ensemble model. To better capture the distinct characteristics, forecasting models were implemented at lead time and lines of business level. The moving windows validation process automatically selected the models which closely represent current market condition. The weekly cadence forecasting schema allowed the model to response effectively to market fluctuation. Generic variable importance analysis was also developed to increase the model interpretability. Rather than assuming fixed distribution, this non-parametric permutation variable importance analysis provided a general framework across methods to evaluate the variable importance. This variable importance framework can further extend to classification problem by modifying the mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) into misclassify error.

1705.06364v1	We develop a new method called Discriminated Hub Graphical Lasso (DHGL) based on Hub Graphical Lasso (HGL) by providing prior information of hubs. We apply this new method in two situations: with known hubs and without known hubs. Then we compare DHGL with HGL using several measures of performance. When some hubs are known, we can always estimate the precision matrix better via DHGL than HGL. When no hubs are known, we use Graphical Lasso (GL) to provide information of hubs and find that the performance of DHGL will always be better than HGL if correct prior information is given and will seldom degenerate when the prior information is wrong.

1508.05913v1	Distance weighted discrimination (DWD) is a margin-based classifier with an interesting geometric motivation. DWD was originally proposed as a superior alternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be popular compared with the SVM. The main reasons are twofold. First, the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone programming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is much more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD mainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting and data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency of DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work, we advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and theoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving DWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing state-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can handle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a special DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural kernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes risk consistency of the kernel DWD. We compare DWD and the SVM on several benchmark data sets and show that the two have comparable classification accuracy, but DWD equipped with our new algorithm can be much faster to compute than the SVM.

1407.4508v2	Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a widely used statistical tool with both well established theory and favorable performance for a wide range of machine learning problems. However, computing CCA for huge datasets can be very slow since it involves implementing QR decomposition or singular value decomposition of huge matrices. In this paper we introduce L-CCA, a iterative algorithm which can compute CCA fast on huge sparse datasets. Theory on both the asymptotic convergence and finite time accuracy of L-CCA are established. The experiments also show that L-CCA outperform other fast CCA approximation schemes on two real datasets.

1611.09706v1	Increasing availability of vehicle GPS data has created potentially transformative opportunities for traffic management, route planning and other location-based services. Critical to the utility of the data is their accuracy. Map-matching is the process of improving the accuracy by aligning GPS data with the road network. In this paper, we propose a purely probabilistic approach to map-matching based on a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm known as particle filters. The approach performs map-matching by producing a range of candidate solutions, each with an associated probability score. We outline implementation details and thoroughly validate the technique on GPS data of varied quality.	Probabilistic map-matching using particle filters
1703.08110v2	How can we train a statistical mixture model on a massive data set? In this work we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians. A coreset is a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models fitting the coreset also provide a good fit for the original data set. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size polynomial in dimension and the number of mixture components, while being independent of the data set size. Hence, one can harness computationally intensive algorithms to compute a good approximation on a significantly smaller data set. More importantly, such coresets can be efficiently constructed both in distributed and streaming settings and do not impose restrictions on the data generating process. Our results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in computational geometry and new combinatorial complexity results for mixtures of Gaussians. Empirical evaluation on several real-world datasets suggests that our coreset-based approach enables significant reduction in training-time with negligible approximation error.	Training Gaussian Mixture Models at Scale via Coresets
1011.3090v2	Multiple kernel learning (MKL), structured sparsity, and multi-task learning have recently received considerable attention. In this paper, we show how different MKL algorithms can be understood as applications of either regularization on the kernel weights or block-norm-based regularization, which is more common in structured sparsity and multi-task learning. We show that these two regularization strategies can be systematically mapped to each other through a concave conjugate operation. When the kernel-weight-based regularizer is separable into components, we can naturally consider a generative probabilistic model behind MKL. Based on this model, we propose learning algorithms for the kernel weights through the maximization of marginal likelihood. We show through numerical experiments that $\ell_2$-norm MKL and Elastic-net MKL achieve comparable accuracy to uniform kernel combination. Although uniform kernel combination might be preferable from its simplicity, $\ell_2$-norm MKL and Elastic-net MKL can learn the usefulness of the information sources represented as kernels. In particular, Elastic-net MKL achieves sparsity in the kernel weights.	Regularization Strategies and Empirical Bayesian Learning for MKL
1703.09975v1	Spectral clustering is a popular and versatile clustering method based on a relaxation of the normalised graph cut objective. Despite its popularity, however, there is no single agreed upon method for tuning the important scaling parameter, nor for determining automatically the number of clusters to extract. Popular heuristics exist, but corresponding theoretical results are scarce. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic value of the normalised cut for an increasing sample assumed to arise from an underlying probability distribution, and based on this result provide recommendations for improving spectral clustering methodology. A corresponding algorithm is proposed with strong empirical performance.	Improving Spectral Clustering using the Asymptotic Value of the  Normalised Cut
1203.3524v1	Gaussian processes (GP) are attractive building blocks for many probabilistic models. Their drawbacks, however, are the rapidly increasing inference time and memory requirement alongside increasing data. The problem can be alleviated with compactly supported (CS) covariance functions, which produce sparse covariance matrices that are fast in computations and cheap to store. CS functions have previously been used in GP regression but here the focus is in a classification problem. This brings new challenges since the posterior inference has to be done approximately. We utilize the expectation propagation algorithm and show how its standard implementation has to be modified to obtain computational benefits from the sparse covariance matrices. We study four CS covariance functions and show that they may lead to substantial speed up in the inference time compared to globally supported functions.	Speeding up the binary Gaussian process classification
1506.07997v1	Finding statistically significant high-order interaction features in predictive modeling is important but challenging task. The difficulty lies in the fact that, for a recent applications with high-dimensional covariates, the number of possible high-order interaction features would be extremely large. Identifying statistically significant features from such a huge pool of candidates would be highly challenging both in computational and statistical senses. To work with this problem, we consider a two stage algorithm where we first select a set of high-order interaction features by marginal screening, and then make statistical inferences on the regression model fitted only with the selected features. Such statistical inferences are called post-selection inference (PSI), and receiving an increasing attention in the literature. One of the seminal recent advancements in PSI literature is the works by Lee et al. where the authors presented an algorithmic framework for computing exact sampling distributions in PSI. A main challenge when applying their approach to our high-order interaction models is to cope with the fact that PSI in general depends not only on the selected features but also on the unselected features, making it hard to apply to our extremely high-dimensional high-order interaction models. The goal of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by introducing a novel efficient method for PSI. Our key idea is to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction features, and to develop a pruning method of the tree which enables us to quickly identify a group of unselected features that are guaranteed to have no influence on PSI. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method allows us to reliably identify statistically significant high-order interaction features with reasonable computational cost.	An Efficient Post-Selection Inference on High-Order Interaction Models
1511.05467v3	We present PESMO, a Bayesian method for identifying the Pareto set of multi-objective optimization problems, when the functions are expensive to evaluate. The central idea of PESMO is to choose evaluation points so as to maximally reduce the entropy of the posterior distribution over the Pareto set. Critically, the PESMO multi-objective acquisition function can be decomposed as a sum of objective-specific acquisition functions, which enables the algorithm to be used in \emph{decoupled} scenarios in which the objectives can be evaluated separately and perhaps with different costs. This decoupling capability also makes it possible to identify difficult objectives that require more evaluations. PESMO also offers gains in efficiency, as its cost scales linearly with the number of objectives, in comparison to the exponential cost of other methods. We compare PESMO with other related methods for multi-objective Bayesian optimization on synthetic and real-world problems. The results show that PESMO produces better recommendations with a smaller number of evaluations of the objectives, and that a decoupled evaluation can lead to improvements in performance, particularly when the number of objectives is large.

1109.2378v1	"This paper presents algorithms for hierarchical, agglomerative clustering which perform most efficiently in the general-purpose setup that is given in modern standard software. Requirements are: (1) the input data is given by pairwise dissimilarities between data points, but extensions to vector data are also discussed (2) the output is a ""stepwise dendrogram"", a data structure which is shared by all implementations in current standard software. We present algorithms (old and new) which perform clustering in this setting efficiently, both in an asymptotic worst-case analysis and from a practical point of view. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) We present a new algorithm which is suitable for any distance update scheme and performs significantly better than the existing algorithms. (2) We prove the correctness of two algorithms by Rohlf and Murtagh, which is necessary in each case for different reasons. (3) We give well-founded recommendations for the best current algorithms for the various agglomerative clustering schemes."	Modern hierarchical, agglomerative clustering algorithms
1612.00555v1	We aim to create a framework for transfer learning using latent factor models to learn the dependence structure between a larger source dataset and a target dataset. The methodology is motivated by our goal of building a risk-assessment model for surgery patients, using both institutional and national surgical outcomes data. The national surgical outcomes data is collected through NSQIP (National Surgery Quality Improvement Program), a database housing almost 4 million patients from over 700 different hospitals. We build a latent factor model with a hierarchical prior on the loadings matrix to appropriately account for the different covariance structure in our data. We extend this model to handle more complex relationships between the populations by deriving a scale mixture formulation using stick-breaking properties. Our model provides a transfer learning framework that utilizes all information from both the source and target data, while modeling the underlying inherent differences between them.

1312.3291v1	The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difficulty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from first principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lovasz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random fields, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider specific graph models, the torus, k-nearest neighbor graphs, and epsilon-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds.	Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan  Statistic
1206.0387v5	We derive relations between theoretical properties of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), popular machine learning models which form the building blocks of deep learning models, and several natural notions from discrete mathematics and convex geometry. We give implications and equivalences relating RBM-representable probability distributions, perfectly reconstructible inputs, Hamming modes, zonotopes and zonosets, point configurations in hyperplane arrangements, linear threshold codes, and multi-covering numbers of hypercubes. As a motivating application, we prove results on the relative representational power of mixtures of product distributions and products of mixtures of pairs of product distributions (RBMs) that formally justify widely held intuitions about distributed representations. In particular, we show that a mixture of products requiring an exponentially larger number of parameters is needed to represent the probability distributions which can be obtained as products of mixtures.

1012.5066v2	We consider adaptive system identification problems with convex constraints and propose a family of regularized Least-Mean-Square (LMS) algorithms. We show that with a properly selected regularization parameter the regularized LMS provably dominates its conventional counterpart in terms of mean square deviations. We establish simple and closed-form expressions for choosing this regularization parameter. For identifying an unknown sparse system we propose sparse and group-sparse LMS algorithms, which are special examples of the regularized LMS family. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed filters in both convergence rate and steady-state error under sparsity assumptions on the true coefficient vector.

1710.07939v1	The characteristics (or numerical patterns) of a feature vector in the transform domain of a perturbation model differ significantly from those of its corresponding feature vector in the input domain. These differences - caused by the perturbation techniques used for the transformation of feature patterns - degrade the performance of machine learning techniques in the transform domain. In this paper, we proposed a nonlinear parametric perturbation model that transforms the input feature patterns to a set of elliptical patterns, and studied the performance degradation issues associated with random forest classification technique using both the input and transform domain features. Compared with the linear transformation such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the proposed method requires less statistical assumptions and is highly suitable for the applications such as data privacy and security due to the difficulty of inverting the elliptical patterns from the transform domain to the input domain. In addition, we adopted a flexible block-wise dimensionality reduction step in the proposed method to accommodate the possible high-dimensional data in modern applications. We evaluated the empirical performance of the proposed method on a network intrusion data set and a biological data set, and compared the results with PCA in terms of classification performance and data privacy protection (measured by the blind source separation attack and signal interference ratio). Both results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed elliptical transformation.	Elliptical modeling and pattern analysis for perturbation models and  classfication
1707.04692v1	Nowadays, with the unprecedented penetration of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), the necessity of an efficient energy forecasting model is more demanding than before. Generally, forecasting models are trained using observed weather data while the trained models are applied for energy forecasting using forecasted weather data. In this study, the performance of several commonly used forecasting methods in the presence of weather predictors with uncertainty is assessed and compared. Accordingly, both observed and forecasted weather data are collected, then the influential predictors for solar PV generation forecasting model are selected using several measures. Using observed and forecasted weather data, an analysis on the uncertainty of weather variables is represented by MAE and bootstrapping. The energy forecasting model is trained using observed weather data, and finally, the performance of several commonly used forecasting methods in solar energy forecasting is simulated and compared for a real case study.

1401.5625v1	The notion of causality is used in many situations dealing with uncertainty. We consider the problem whether causality can be identified given data set generated by discrete random variables rather than continuous ones. In particular, for non-binary data, thus far it was only known that causality can be identified except rare cases. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient condition for an integer modular acyclic additive noise (IMAN) of two variables. In addition, we relate bivariate and multivariate causal identifiability in a more explicit manner, and develop a practical algorithm to find the order of variables and their parent sets. We demonstrate its performance in applications to artificial data and real world body motion data with comparisons to conventional methods.

1004.2304v1	We consider the problem of estimating the topology of spatial interactions in a discrete state, discrete time spatio-temporal graphical model where the interactions affect the temporal evolution of each agent in a network. Among other models, the susceptible, infected, recovered ($SIR$) model for interaction events fall into this framework. We pose the problem as a structure learning problem and solve it using an $\ell_1$-penalized likelihood convex program. We evaluate the solution on a simulated spread of infectious over a complex network. Our topology estimates outperform those of a standard spatial Markov random field graphical model selection using $\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression.	Spatio-Temporal Graphical Model Selection
1405.3379v1	Additive models play an important role in semiparametric statistics. This paper gives learning rates for regularized kernel based methods for additive models. These learning rates compare favourably in particular in high dimensions to recent results on optimal learning rates for purely nonparametric regularized kernel based quantile regression using the Gaussian radial basis function kernel, provided the assumption of an additive model is valid. Additionally, a concrete example is presented to show that a Gaussian function depending only on one variable lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by an additive Gaussian kernel, but does not belong to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space generated by the multivariate Gaussian kernel of the same variance.

1606.09066v3	Tree ensembles, such as random forests and boosted trees, are renowned for their high prediction performance. However, their interpretability is critically limited due to the enormous complexity. In this study, we present a method to make a complex tree ensemble interpretable by simplifying the model. Specifically, we formalize the simplification of tree ensembles as a model selection problem. Given a complex tree ensemble, we aim at obtaining the simplest representation that is essentially equivalent to the original one. To this end, we derive a Bayesian model selection algorithm that optimizes the simplified model while maintaining the prediction performance. Our numerical experiments on several datasets showed that complicated tree ensembles were reasonably approximated as interpretable.	Making Tree Ensembles Interpretable: A Bayesian Model Selection Approach
1703.08619v3	This paper deals with the problem of large-scale linear supervised learning in settings where a large number of continuous features are available. We propose to combine the well-known trick of one-hot encoding of continuous features with a new penalization called binarsity. In each group of binary features coming from the one-hot encoding of a single raw continuous feature, this penalization uses total-variation regularization together with an extra linear constraint to avoid collinearity within groups. Non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for generalized linear models are proposed, and numerical experiments illustrate the good performances of our approach on several datasets. It is also noteworthy that our method has a numerical complexity comparable to standard $\ell_1$ penalization.	Binarsity: a penalization for one-hot encoded features
1704.02107v3	"The ""least absolute shrinkage and selection operator"" (Lasso) method has been adapted recently for networkstructured datasets. In particular, this network Lasso method allows to learn graph signals from a small number of noisy signal samples by using the total variation of a graph signal for regularization. While efficient and scalable implementations of the network Lasso are available, only little is known about the conditions on the underlying network structure which ensure network Lasso to be accurate. By leveraging concepts of compressed sensing, we address this gap and derive precise conditions on the underlying network topology and sampling set which guarantee the network Lasso for a particular loss function to deliver an accurate estimate of the entire underlying graph signal. We also quantify the error incurred by network Lasso in terms of two constants which reflect the connectivity of the sampled nodes."	When is Network Lasso Accurate?
1504.01362v7	We present a new approach to estimating the interdependence of industries in an economy by applying data science solutions. By exploiting interfirm buyer--seller network data, we show that the problem of estimating the interdependence of industries is similar to the problem of uncovering the latent block structure in network science literature. To estimate the underlying structure with greater accuracy, we propose an extension of the sparse block model that incorporates node textual information and an unbounded number of industries and interactions among them. The latter task is accomplished by extending the well-known Chinese restaurant process to two dimensions. Inference is based on collapsed Gibbs sampling, and the model is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that the proposed model improves in predictive accuracy and successfully provides a satisfactory solution to the motivated problem. We also discuss issues that affect the future performance of this approach.	A New Approach to Building the Interindustry Input--Output Table
1110.5238v1	We consider a Gaussian process formulation of the multiple kernel learning problem. The goal is to select the convex combination of kernel matrices that best explains the data and by doing so improve the generalisation on unseen data. Sparsity in the kernel weights is obtained by adopting a hierarchical Bayesian approach: Gaussian process priors are imposed over the latent functions and generalised inverse Gaussians on their associated weights. This construction is equivalent to imposing a product of heavy-tailed process priors over function space. A variational inference algorithm is derived for regression and binary classification.	Multiple Gaussian Process Models
1709.01179v2	Two fundamental problems in unsupervised learning are efficient inference for latent-variable models and robust density estimation based on large amounts of unlabeled data. Algorithms for the two tasks, such as normalizing flows and generative adversarial networks (GANs), are often developed independently. In this paper, we propose the concept of {\em continuous-time flows} (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling knowledge from a CTF for efficient inference, and learning an explicit energy-based distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Both tasks rely on a new technique for distribution matching within amortized learning. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related techniques.	Continuous-Time Flows for Efficient Inference and Density Estimation
1012.1501v2	We consider a class of sparsity-inducing regularization terms based on submodular functions. While previous work has focused on non-decreasing functions, we explore symmetric submodular functions and their \lova extensions. We show that the Lovasz extension may be seen as the convex envelope of a function that depends on level sets (i.e., the set of indices whose corresponding components of the underlying predictor are greater than a given constant): this leads to a class of convex structured regularization terms that impose prior knowledge on the level sets, and not only on the supports of the underlying predictors. We provide a unified set of optimization algorithms, such as proximal operators, and theoretical guarantees (allowed level sets and recovery conditions). By selecting specific submodular functions, we give a new interpretation to known norms, such as the total variation; we also define new norms, in particular ones that are based on order statistics with application to clustering and outlier detection, and on noisy cuts in graphs with application to change point detection in the presence of outliers.	Shaping Level Sets with Submodular Functions
1507.03092v2	Random survival forests (RSF) are a powerful method for risk prediction of right-censored outcomes in biomedical research. RSF use the log-rank split criterion to form an ensemble of survival trees. The most common approach to evaluate the prediction accuracy of a RSF model is Harrell's concordance index for survival data ('C index'). Conceptually, this strategy implies that the split criterion in RSF is different from the evaluation criterion of interest. This discrepancy can be overcome by using Harrell's C for both node splitting and evaluation. We compare the difference between the two split criteria analytically and in simulation studies with respect to the preference of more unbalanced splits, termed end-cut preference (ECP). Specifically, we show that the log-rank statistic has a stronger ECP compared to the C index. In simulation studies and with the help of two medical data sets we demonstrate that the accuracy of RSF predictions, as measured by Harrell's C, can be improved if the log-rank statistic is replaced by the C index for node splitting. This is especially true in situations where the censoring rate or the fraction of informative continuous predictor variables is high. Conversely, log-rank splitting is preferable in noisy scenarios. Both C-based and log-rank splitting are implemented in the R~package ranger. We recommend Harrell's C as split criterion for use in smaller scale clinical studies and the log-rank split criterion for use in large-scale 'omics' studies.
